        <p>first off i am a republican, 19, dont watch or listen to news too often, and i do research some on stuff. if thats all you read then good for you. u can read what i have to say about that at the very end where i reply to anyone saying tl;dr.</p>
<p>politics and the economy shouldnt be tied together at all really. so presidents should never be blamed for economic problems. and we need a president that isnt a puppet, which obama is. i know im going to get flamed but who cares.</p>
<p>we are capitalist not communist or socialists( names of economic systems not a form of government like a republic, oligarchy). if the business fails let it fail they dont need to be bailed out. its their fault, they spend to much money and made bad decisions. how many real people actually get a second chance like all those companies did? as far as i know nobody unless they have wealthy parents who will bail them out. the government is the parents of our economic system? no. the only role government needs to have with the economy is taxes, and printing the money. im sorry if ppl lose jobs b/c the company they work for went belly up. a company to the government is seen as a entity.</p>
<p>instead of placing blame on presidents, blame the all current government officials, they are the ones who pass the budget bills, with the approval of the president. study and see how little say the president has on such matter. compare the federal government spending, and the income from taxes and stuff. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7a/U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2007.png/800px-U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2007.png" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/U.S._Federal_Receipts_-_FY_2007.png/800px-U.S._Federal_Receipts_-_FY_2007.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>about our jobs. clinton opened trade with china in the early 90’s. and offshore outsourcing needs to be stopped. yes we are helping other countries but we are being sucked dry. look here: <a href="http://www.uschina.org/statistics/tradetable.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.uschina.org/statistics/tradetable.html</a></p>
<p>as i stated above presidents have nothing to do with the economy since we are a capitalist(look it up if u dont know what that is) economy. really why are we going in to debt??? idk maybe giving china $200 billion a year couldnt be a reason. obama care? really has it help is it going to help? i think that was the largest waste of money ever. one good thing the global economy does is allows us to travel to another country and have our cash worth something there. but idk if thats worth giving out so much money each year.</p>
<p>americans need to lower our cost of living and maybe we would have less people in poverty. actually teach ppl how to succeed in life at school. teach parents how to raise children, and create and enforce some law about postmarital sex. americans need to learn responsibility, by owning up to their actions.</p>
<p>the way to grade a president and any political leader is to record what they said they will do and then see if they actually completed it. also look into the way our government works. they president has as much power as the rest of the branches. u may say but hes a single person. true. maybe that means they need to be more than one president at a time?</p>
<p>a lot of ur arguments sound like hear say to me and not facts.</p>
<p>has anyone heard of the fair tax act(<a href="http://www.fairtax.org/site/PageServer" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fairtax.org/site/PageServer</a>? you should support this and this will do a way better job of stimulating the economy than the stimulus package. if u need me to explain how this will help i will gladly explain it but right now i dont have the time. i am actually sitting through my lunch just to type this reply to this thread. explain in short, it gets rid of all federal taxes except for the sales tax, which will be much higher than what the current sales tax is. democrats spread lies about this proposal, and say that the republicans want to pass this and it will add something like 21% sales tax to everything. that is a big lie and scare just to take votes from republicans.</p>
<p>i personally have not looked at this yet but this organization is composed of americans that want to see america to be well again, also they know what they are talking about and tell it how it is. the news is biased.</p>
<p>an idea my brother proposed is since every country is in debt why doesnt the country with least amount of debt erase its debt and subtract that off every other countries debt? that is a good idea. why not? the economy is based off of nothing. the value of the dollar is what ever u make it; meaning that a dollar is just a piece of cloth that the government tells its citizens that you can use this to trade for things you need. blah blah. dont believe me, look it up.</p>
<p>i think this is about all i can think of on this matter atm. but look in the constitution, its says that if the government isnt what the people want we the people have the right to overthrow the government officials, and redo the government like another revolution.(ill have to get back to you exactly where it is but i read it with my own eyes)</p>
<p>ik tl;dr. and to that its not my fault you will continue to stay naive and ignorant to how the government rules your life, and that if you dont take action than in reality the government owns you, you dont own the government.</p>
<p>edit: sorry if i make typos i do it all the time. i dont proofread b4 i send. ive noticed that some places i type they instead of the, idky though.</p>

<p>politics and the economy shouldnt be tied together at all really. so presidents should never be blamed for economic problems. and we need a president that isnt a puppet, which obama is. i know im going to get flamed but who cares.</p>
<p>we are capitalist not communist or socialists( names of economic systems not a form of government like a republic, oligarchy). if the business fails let it fail they dont need to be bailed out. its their fault, they spend to much money and made bad decisions. how many real people actually get a second chance like all those companies did? as far as i know nobody unless they have wealthy parents who will bail them out. the government is the parents of our economic system? no. the only role government needs to have with the economy is taxes, and printing the money. im sorry if ppl lose jobs b/c the company they work for went belly up. a company to the government is seen as a entity.</p>
<p>instead of placing blame on presidents, blame the all current government officials, they are the ones who pass the budget bills, with the approval of the president. study and see how little say the president has on such matter. compare the federal government spending, and the income from taxes and stuff. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7a/U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2007.png/800px-U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2007.png" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/U.S._Federal_Receipts_-_FY_2007.png/800px-U.S._Federal_Receipts_-_FY_2007.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>about our jobs. clinton opened trade with china in the early 90’s. and offshore outsourcing needs to be stopped. yes we are helping other countries but we are being sucked dry. look here: <a href="http://www.uschina.org/statistics/tradetable.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.uschina.org/statistics/tradetable.html</a></p>
<p>as i stated above presidents have nothing to do with the economy since we are a capitalist(look it up if u dont know what that is) economy. really why are we going in to debt??? idk maybe giving china $200 billion a year couldnt be a reason. obama care? really has it help is it going to help? i think that was the largest waste of money ever. one good thing the global economy does is allows us to travel to another country and have our cash worth something there. but idk if thats worth giving out so much money each year.</p>
<p>americans need to lower our cost of living and maybe we would have less people in poverty. actually teach ppl how to succeed in life at school. teach parents how to raise children, and create and enforce some law about postmarital sex. americans need to learn responsibility, by owning up to their actions.</p>
<p>the way to grade a president and any political leader is to record what they said they will do and then see if they actually completed it. also look into the way our government works. they president has as much power as the rest of the branches. u may say but hes a single person. true. maybe that means they need to be more than one president at a time?</p>
<p>a lot of ur arguments sound like hear say to me and not facts.</p>
<p>has anyone heard of the fair tax act(<a href="http://www.fairtax.org/site/PageServer" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fairtax.org/site/PageServer</a>? you should support this and this will do a way better job of stimulating the economy than the stimulus package. if u need me to explain how this will help i will gladly explain it but right now i dont have the time. i am actually sitting through my lunch just to type this reply to this thread. explain in short, it gets rid of all federal taxes except for the sales tax, which will be much higher than what the current sales tax is. democrats spread lies about this proposal, and say that the republicans want to pass this and it will add something like 21% sales tax to everything. that is a big lie and scare just to take votes from republicans.</p>
<p>i personally have not looked at this yet but this organization is composed of americans that want to see america to be well again, also they know what they are talking about and tell it how it is. the news is biased.</p>
<p>an idea my brother proposed is since every country is in debt why doesnt the country with least amount of debt erase its debt and subtract that off every other countries debt? that is a good idea. why not? the economy is based off of nothing. the value of the dollar is what ever u make it; meaning that a dollar is just a piece of cloth that the government tells its citizens that you can use this to trade for things you need. blah blah. dont believe me, look it up.</p>
<p>i think this is about all i can think of on this matter atm. but look in the constitution, its says that if the government isnt what the people want we the people have the right to overthrow the government officials, and redo the government like another revolution.(ill have to get back to you exactly where it is but i read it with my own eyes)</p>
<p>ik tl;dr. and to that its not my fault you will continue to stay naive and ignorant to how the government rules your life, and that if you dont take action than in reality the government owns you, you dont own the government.</p>
<p>edit: sorry if i make typos i do it all the time. i dont proofread b4 i send. ive noticed that some places i type they instead of the, idky though.[/quote]You should speak in the MITB discussions/news sections instead, that’s where you’ll actually find people capable of understanding these topics.</p>

</aside>
<p>To bad getting into politics requires money, they state any american citizen can run for office, but in actuality only people with money can.</p>
<p>On Topic, anyone claiming he’s turned the economy around for you all needs to learn basic economics… he’s pumped 1.4 trillion dollars into the economy and its barely gotten any better, thats a failure on any standards. Not only was the money a waste, but he has nothing to show for it other than debt. He should of done what presidents in the past did, build something. Last time america faced an issue like this, there was a massive government effort to create roads/bridges. That created jobs, income, and infrastructure that quickly payed off the debt the government accrued.</p>
<p>He’s done nothing of value.</p>

<p>You completely misunderstood what i posted… America didnt have the money in the first place, but now you are 1.4T in debt with nothing to show for it besides a few banks not going bankrupt. What should of happened is you spend that 1.4 trillion on things that are actually useful, infrastructure/schooling.</p>

<p>First off I would like to state that I still believe the reason Obama has put us in so much debt is with Bush. I would love for you to post where you got that information from because a lot of it is controversial in my mind. Especially with the stimulus package not working. I am seeing the effects myself, not listening to some reporter state some bullshit facts/data.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Bush is only accountable for $1T (both wars). Another $1T was lost instantly on 9/11, and katrina was another big chunk, and finally the housing market collapse that originated under carter which forced banks to give loans to people it normally wouldnt launched the recession.</p>
<p>If Obama had used the stimulus package like he promised (to fund infrastructure like bridges and other shovel ready jobs) It more than likely would have had a positive effect, but his main priority was using the money to fund entitlement programs and bail out states.</p>
<p>The effects you’re feeling aren’t consistent, just common fluctuations of the market system.</p>

<p>Personally I think he should never of been in the office… Correct me if I am wrong, since bush’s presidency was 3 years ago, but I’m pretty sure I remember Joe Biden using bush like a puppet. And Joe Biden I believe also held use shares or of the same nature in oil companies and greatly profited from bushs presidency.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No one knows how Bush would have been, he was fortunes fool. Once the wars disrupted the majority of his plans, and then Katrina, his first term was practically over. The second term he was re elected but with a democratic congress, and this explains the puppetry. 9/11 would still have happened if it wasn’t Bush, it was impossible to implement such defense policies within your first few months, Katrina would still have happened, and the housing market would still have collapsed. Bush was blamed for all of this, and Obama is also. Bush and Obama are both going to be held accountable for Carter and FDR because of ignorance.</p>

<p>Your not a fool, and have done some research of your own, which I applaud. I would like to see where your getting all of it first to make sure you didn’t accidentally exaggerate something. And, yes, I may turn my head to some of the mistakes that he makes, but it’s not that I am turning my head and ignoring it. It is more of the fact that he is our president and he will be for two years. He isn’t doing the best job as far as you can tell at the moment and he isn’t doing the worst. I’m pretty sure you can name presidents who were worse than him. How exactly does him golfing in japan while it was hit with an earthquake have to do anything? And usually businessman talk over matters and agreements while they golf. I just fail to see what your point is in that statement.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’re right, he isnt doing good, he isnt doing the worst, hes doing nothing (but I personally think the whole healthcare thing throws him off the boat). Him golfing in Japan was a problem because he should have been talking to congress about a budget to assist Japan</p>
<p>[quote=“xryz, post:23, topic:393494”]first off i am a republican, 19, dont watch or listen to news too often, and i do research some on stuff. if thats all you read then good for you. u can read what i have to say about that at the very end where i reply to anyone saying tl;dr.</p>
<p>politics and the economy shouldnt be tied together at all really. so presidents should never be blamed for economic problems. and we need a president that isnt a puppet, which obama is. i know im going to get flamed but who cares.</p>
<p>we are capitalist not communist or socialists( names of economic systems not a form of government like a republic, oligarchy). if the business fails let it fail they dont need to be bailed out. its their fault, they spend to much money and made bad decisions. how many real people actually get a second chance like all those companies did? as far as i know nobody unless they have wealthy parents who will bail them out. the government is the parents of our economic system? no. the only role government needs to have with the economy is taxes, and printing the money. im sorry if ppl lose jobs b/c the company they work for went belly up. a company to the government is seen as a entity.</p>
<p>instead of placing blame on presidents, blame the all current government officials, they are the ones who pass the budget bills, with the approval of the president. study and see how little say the president has on such matter. compare the federal government spending, and the income from taxes and stuff. <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7a/U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2007.png/800px-U.S._Federal_Spending_-_FY_2007.png" alt width="" height=""><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/U.S._Federal_Receipts_-_FY_2007.png/800px-U.S._Federal_Receipts_-_FY_2007.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>about our jobs. clinton opened trade with china in the early 90’s. and offshore outsourcing needs to be stopped. yes we are helping other countries but we are being sucked dry. look here: <a href="http://www.uschina.org/statistics/tradetable.html" data-bbcode="true">http://www.uschina.org/statistics/tradetable.html</a></p>
<p>as i stated above presidents have nothing to do with the economy since we are a capitalist(look it up if u dont know what that is) economy. really why are we going in to debt??? idk maybe giving china $200 billion a year couldnt be a reason. obama care? really has it help is it going to help? i think that was the largest waste of money ever. one good thing the global economy does is allows us to travel to another country and have our cash worth something there. but idk if thats worth giving out so much money each year.</p>
<p>americans need to lower our cost of living and maybe we would have less people in poverty. actually teach ppl how to succeed in life at school. teach parents how to raise children, and create and enforce some law about postmarital sex. americans need to learn responsibility, by owning up to their actions.</p>
<p>the way to grade a president and any political leader is to record what they said they will do and then see if they actually completed it. also look into the way our government works. they president has as much power as the rest of the branches. u may say but hes a single person. true. maybe that means they need to be more than one president at a time?</p>
<p>a lot of ur arguments sound like hear say to me and not facts.</p>
<p>has anyone heard of the fair tax act(<a href="http://www.fairtax.org/site/PageServer" data-bbcode="true">http://www.fairtax.org/site/PageServer</a>? you should support this and this will do a way better job of stimulating the economy than the stimulus package. if u need me to explain how this will help i will gladly explain it but right now i dont have the time. i am actually sitting through my lunch just to type this reply to this thread. explain in short, it gets rid of all federal taxes except for the sales tax, which will be much higher than what the current sales tax is. democrats spread lies about this proposal, and say that the republicans want to pass this and it will add something like 21% sales tax to everything. that is a big lie and scare just to take votes from republicans.</p>
<p>i personally have not looked at this yet but this organization is composed of americans that want to see america to be well again, also they know what they are talking about and tell it how it is. the news is biased.</p>
<p>an idea my brother proposed is since every country is in debt why doesnt the country with least amount of debt erase its debt and subtract that off every other countries debt? that is a good idea. why not? the economy is based off of nothing. the value of the dollar is what ever u make it; meaning that a dollar is just a piece of cloth that the government tells its citizens that you can use this to trade for things you need. blah blah. dont believe me, look it up.</p>
<p>i think this is about all i can think of on this matter atm. but look in the constitution, its says that if the government isnt what the people want we the people have the right to overthrow the government officials, and redo the government like another revolution.(ill have to get back to you exactly where it is but i read it with my own eyes)</p>
<p>ik tl;dr. and to that its not my fault you will continue to stay naive and ignorant to how the government rules your life, and that if you dont take action than in reality the government owns you, you dont own the government.</p>
<p>edit: sorry if i make typos i do it all the time. i dont proofread b4 i send. ive noticed that some places i type they instead of the, idky though.[/quote]</p>
<p>You raise good points but you’re going to hit a comprehension wall. Wanderer isn’t too into worried about economical consequences, hes more worried about the welfare of the people and the general well being and peace of the country. There is nothing wrong with this, but we need a stable economy to fund the welfare of the people, otherwise they’re going to become accustomed the style of living entitlement programs provide, and once its time to really dig in with cuts because of procrastinations you’re going to get another greece.</p>

        <p>A lot of people say he hasn’t done anything, however, we are technically out of the recession. True, it isn’t noticeable enough to create jobs, but it’s steadily rising. He hasn’t overall done to much, as it’s been mostly the house &amp; senate, like how they stopped the government shutdown. Had the government shutdown happened, typical Americans would have blamed Obama, saying that he made a lot of people lose jobs.<br>
In some ways, it’s a good thing most Americans don’t vote, because then every president would be bad and it would sway from Democratic from Republican each time. People say they vote the man, but they vote D or R each time. Or green party, lol.<br>
However, because of what just happened with Osama, his approval rating is going to increase greatly.<br>
I was watching “Today” this morning, who generally swing more liberal, and therefor Democratic, and they really enforced the idea that Obama took time on getting information and leads before making an attack on the mansion where Osama was believed to be. However, a friend of mine watched CNN and said it was just on the list of believed areas to attack.<br>
If he does get reelected, however, a lot more will get done, because most presidents spend their first presidency trying to get reelected, which could waste a whole year or two. With the second term, he’ll just work to the very end. That and black people will all vote for him.</p>
