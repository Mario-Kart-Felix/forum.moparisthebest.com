    <title>Question about 317 mapdata and how to edit it</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-317-mapdata-and-how-to-edit-it/371086</link>
    <description>I want to create my own world.

So how or what program do I need to make this work?[Name of program please and dl link please]Also, how would I make it so it will load and that will become the new world so to speak. 

Or rather to sum it all up. I want to deleate all the old rs mapdata and replace the whole world with this. My new world map replaces the old rs mapdata.

Felt liks this should be on here scince some don&#39;t read replies before posting.
[quote=&quot;Spades&quot;]I would look into a map editor, then you can create your own area&#39;s in blank spaces. Instead of deleting it you can use the other places for other things in your server. Just code it at like 0,0 Then spread from there.[/quote]
Well see I guess this isn&#39;t going to really be a rsps. I don&#39;t want any bit of rs mapdata. =/ After that I am going to start replacing items 1 by 1. And deleating old rs items.</description>
