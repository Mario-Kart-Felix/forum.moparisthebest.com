    <title>Can SomeOne Please Make A WebClient For Me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-please-make-a-webclient-for-me/354952</link>
    <description>I really need a webclient for my server. I have a client that is made, but I can&#39;t figure out how to turn it into a webclient. I tried Ric&#39;s WebClient Tutorial. I also tried another way, but it wouldn&#39;t work. Could someone please make one for me or give me the URL for a good webclient tutorial?</description>
