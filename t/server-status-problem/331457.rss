    <title>Server status problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-status-problem/331457</link>
    <description>Well i recently tried adding my server to the status page and it was banned.

I contacted moparisbest &amp; got no reply after about 2 months.

It is still banned can anyone help me.

I didn&#39;t do anything to brake the rules.

So please don&#39;t lock this thread

I had opened one on moparscape general discussion and it got locked saying there is already a thread about it. I searched all over moparscape for this thread and found nothing 

so if someone can help me it would be great.</description>
