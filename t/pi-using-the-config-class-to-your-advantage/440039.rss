    <description>[b]What is This?[/b] This will teach you how to use the Config class to your advantage and stop the need to change multiple files to update 1 thing.

[b]Difficulty:[/b] 2/10

[b]Requirements:[/b] PI Server, Brain (or atleast half of one). 

[b]Purpose:[/b] The purpose of this tutorial is to teach you that there is alot more potential in the config file than alot of people realise. This makes life so much easier and means you don&#39;t always have to edit alot of files. This will be proven within the tutorial.
[hr]

Lets Begin, Firstly i&#39;m going to show you how to use the config class to limit items to certain player rights. For example, Making mod only armour, admin only armour and owner only armour.

Ok, What you need to do is open your config.java and add something like this.

[code=java]public static final int[] MOD_ITEMS	=	{1,2,3,4,5};[/code]
What this does is define anything that is inside the array as a mod item.

Now go to ItemAssistant class and find this &#39;[i]public boolean wearItem(int wearID, int slot) {[/i]&#39;

[code]
if(c.playerRights &gt;= 1) {
  for(int i : Config.MOD_ITEMS)
    if(wearID == i) {
      c.sendMessage(&quot;You must be a Moderator or better to use this item.&quot;);
    return false;
}[/code]
What this does is check if the playerRights is Greater Than or Equal Too 1 and if it is cross references with the Config.MOD_ITEMS we defined earlier and if you&#39;re not playerRights 1 or better it sends the message.

repeat this for more ranks.

[hr]

[b]How to use Config.Java to allow global spawning or not.[/b]

Define this into Config.java

[code]	public static final boolean GLOBAL_SPAWNING = false;[/code]
if you want everyone to be able to spawn you would change this to True. What this does is define weather global spawning is true or false.

Now in commands.java replace you ::item with this
[code]			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;item&quot;) &amp;&amp; Config.GLOBAL_SPAWNING == true) || (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;item&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights == 3) {
				try {
					String[] args = playerCommand.split(&quot; &quot;);
					if (args.length == 3) {
						int newItemID = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
						int newItemAmount = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);
						if ((newItemID &lt;= 20500) &amp;&amp; (newItemID &gt;= 0)) {
							c.getItems().addItem(newItemID, newItemAmount);		
						} else {
							c.sendMessage(&quot;That item ID does not exist.&quot;);
						}
					} else {
						c.sendMessage(&quot;Wrong usage: (Ex:(::item_ID_Amount)(::item 995 1))&quot;);
					}
				} catch(Exception e) {
					c.sendMessage(&quot;Global Spawning is currently Disabled...&quot;);
				}
				}[/code]

Basically what this does is check if gklobal spawning is true, or if you are an owner, if you are it allows you to spawn, if not it sends the message &#39;Global Spawning is currently Disabled...&#39;

[hr]

[b]Making Teleports[/b]
Say you have 4 areas of code that all teleport you to one place, Say you want to change that place, :O you need to change 4 files/areas of code. This removes the need to do that.

in config make something like this.
[code]
	public static final int NUB_LOC_X = xxxx;
	public static final int NUB_LOC_Y = yyyy;
	public static final String NUB_LOC = &quot;You teleport to the Nub Location.&quot;;[/code]

basically this defines a permanent X coord and a permanent Y coord and defines a string that we will send.

To use this code you would do this: 
[code]
				if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;nubloc&quot;)) {
					c.getPA().movePlayer(Config.NUB_LOC_X, Config.NUB_LOC_Y, 0);
					c.sendMessage(Config_NUB_LOC);
				  }[/code]

basically that would grab the message and the coords and teleport the player to there and send the message we defined. Sorry for this part being rushed i had to go

[hr]

I will expand to this later, as i have to leave now. i hope this helps. I&#39;m not sure if any of these work, they may cause errors as i have not tested any of them.</description>
