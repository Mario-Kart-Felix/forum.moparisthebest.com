    <title>Computer Programmer - Science</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/computer-programmer-science/160939</link>
    <description>So, I have a big project due on Wednesday, and I have yet to start. :(

I have to look up some information on Computer Programming..

Here are some questions if any of you want to help.. :) You should help me though..

&lt;blockquote&gt;What is the job like?


How do you get ready? What education is required from high school to college?


How much does this job pay?


How many jobs are there?


What about the future of this job?


Are there other jobs like this?


What kind of tools does this job require?


Where can you find more information?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And then I have to research someone that has to do with this stuff. O.O I could do Bill Gates :D

&lt;blockquote&gt;Who is this person?


Tell a little about this person. What is important for others to know?
You must focus on the job and they do and how they started in this career.


Explain what they like and don&#39;t like about the job.


Tell a little about this person and their other interests/hobbies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Please help people!
I am doing bad in Science. I currently have a C- and I need to get it up!</description>
