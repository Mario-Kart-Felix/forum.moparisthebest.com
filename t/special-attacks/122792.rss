    <description>Does anyone know of a server that has working specials? or even just one weapon special?

I&#39;d like a server with a dds special, If anyone knows of any could they please post a download link.

Also, When you attack an npc/player is there a way to make them face each other?
And where can I fix the problem of when you pick up an item (say shark) and theres say 20 on the ground
and you pick one up and all 20 disappear, I&#39;d like it to be normal, so you can get all 20.

thanks</description>
