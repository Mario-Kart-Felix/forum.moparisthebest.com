              <p>No actually, you need to save the membership status with the saveinfo() and savemoreinfo() (if it exists) method, you need to edit that. Also, load it with the loadinfo() and loadmoreinfo() method. This way when the player logs out, his membership status will be saved and when he logs in it will be loaded. If you need me to make the code for you just say so.</p>
