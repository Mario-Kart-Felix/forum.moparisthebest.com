    <title>The whole chat function thing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-whole-chat-function-thing/518646</link>
    <description>To provoke some discussion, I wanted to bring this up: I know a lot (if not all) of the members here don&#39;t use the IRC. I know the prospect of a chatbox for the forum has been brought up in the past but shot down by people proclaiming that everyone can use the IRC client with ease, so I&#39;m sort of wondering why nobody here uses the IRC and whether you guys think providing some kind of chatbox would be a step in the right direction.

My current thoughts on the matter are that we should update the horrible client on the IRC CHAT tab, to a more sleek and updated one which would hopefully provide a nicer GUI, rather than that clunky blue applet that currently resides on the page. The other thing I wanted to bring up was the potential for an extra forum theme, this was brought up in a recent staff meeting and the consensus for such an addition was simple: If it has enough support, and isn&#39;t anything silly then it can be added and maintained. What do you guys think about this prospect? And do you have any theme suggestions, right now there is only the one that Frell suggested that I could remember:

http://custom.simplemachines.org/themes/index.php?lemma=2600

There was also the greenfox theme from a while back, but I can&#39;t remember the name explicitly. I want to have a set of clear and concise themes to present for a potential vote topic. The board has sort of gone into deadlock, and I&#39;m primarily to blame because I haven&#39;t really paid much time into it as of late, but as I said in the sticky you&#39;re allowed to discuss pretty much anything here, within reason, and I&#39;d be happy to hear your input.</description>

              <p>It’s not just the inconsistency of it working either, sure it works, but not a lot and comes riddled with issues but there is also the fact it looks horrendous . I remember a few years ago there was an SMF mod which implemented an IRCE into the forum, so it emulated what an IRC was except in a more friendly and accessible environment, it was fully dynamic using AJAX and read permissions using your SMF profile.</p>
<p>I’m not saying that should be implemented, because why try and emulate something we have, but the point is it posses characteristics that should work with this IRC. For example and most importantly, you launch the page and you connect there shouldn’t be this messing around and stuff not working. The IRC is already quite an abstract place for a lot of users, why make it even harder by throwing obstacles in the way just to connect. The other thing is, the theme, it looks dismal the mod I was referring too above was simplistic, and clean with easily colour customization whereas PJIRC looks so tacky, and outdated.</p>
<p>We have a blue forum, a black homepage, and an IRC applet that when works looks like something from the 1970s. Any person with an inability to read the URL bar would assume they were on a different site when they were on each page. This is something I’ll be bring up at any oncoming staff meetings.</p>

A chatbox is even messier than standard IRC. IRC is a cheap and effective way to communicate in large group, small groups, or even just one on one. A chatbox is literally an open discussion room. IRC is meant to increase productivity and discussion, whereas a chatbox seems to encourage nothing but spam and likely conflict. I’m not saying a chatbox/shoutbox is a bad thing, I’m just stating what I foresee happening. I have little against implementing one, but I see almost no gain from it.<br>

By messy I didn’t mean the client (mIRC and Opera IRC is quite good), but the overall chat jumps from one subject to another without any direction.</p>
<p>As I said, this wouldn’t be fixed with a chatbox, and I don’t think a chatbox would involve more people who aren’t already on <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>.[/quote]</p>

It sometimes seems like this community has a lot have negative appeals towards others sometimes. Perhaps if people would actually have a chance to communicate without the forums - they’ll be able to have more friendships? I mean sure this is a big leap but c’mon… at this point we need to do something. There is so much hate sometimes in this community.</p>
<p>The only thing I would worry about is new-people, or current people asking about a lot of help in the chatbox and “spamming” it with those sorts of questions.</p>

Moderating any chatbox from advertisements and other forms of spam would most likely be a pain.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Then have more moderators, I’ve heard that excuse over-and-over from this community and tired of hearing it. This community doesn’t demote inactive moderators because it doesn’t hurt, and so we can promote more if we need to.</p>
<p>Having a chatbox on the forum directly is a bit better.[/quote]</p>
<p>Let me tell you from past experience that having a lot of moderators does not always change that factor. This forum receives many hits per day. Our Server Status page is one of the most popular out there, if not the most popular. People will go to great lengths to advertise because most private servers now are in search of financial gain rather than player entertainment. Every moderator starts out at an A+ level, but will gradually fall into a slower stance over time. Before my resignation, I was dealing with 20+ reports by myself every couple hours, even though there were numerous other moderators. When we’re also talking about a chatbox, those moderators need to be <span class="bbcode-i">watching</span> the chatbox.</p>
<p>Adding more moderators for chat-box ONLY has potential, I’m just posting a scenario where it’d be a problem. I am completely against making any post counter requirement as well. People will try to avoid being detected as spamming by posting quick, unhelpful responses in sections such as Server Help. Generally these responses go unnoticed because reports are never filed.</p>

Having moparian is a post-rank though so goes against your point of having for post count?</p>
<p>Edit: Nvm. I see what you mean now.</p>
<p>Well, I’m sure we could come up with something… I still prefer an on-forum chatbox no matter what. There are is hardly no activity on that IRC (from at least what I have logged into [bunch of AFK people or not on the page] which was at least a month ago because I hate it). Honestly, what’s the harm of at least testing the idea of having a chatbox.</p>
<p>Many people are narrowed-minded with suggestions posted and if we at least gave them a TRY - it could become a nice outcome perhaps, we never know.</p>

              <p>I don’t think IRC could appeal to anyone visually. A chatbox would be an effective move to have others interact without the use of PM and threads.

It just seems like a simple way to increase community interaction, but there are still problems with the idea.</p>
