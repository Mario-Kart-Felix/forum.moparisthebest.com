    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-anyone-clear-this-up-for-me/546280</link>
    <description>Coding newbie here and just started AP Computer Sci. Can somebody please point out the differences between classes, methods, and objects? I still get them mixed up and don&#39;t know when or how to use them. I have a general understand but I would like to go further in depth. Yes I know this is a noob question  :o</description>

<p>Oh my… You are completely fuking retarded. With the 1) … That was one of two options he could have done. He could have 1) done a google search […] or 2) ask. I’m not telling him to do a Google search, I was listing him the options. And that was a <span class="bbcode-i">mocking</span> of what people have been saying. Holy motherfuking shit. People need to read before jumping to conclusions.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Do a Google search, since you know nothing about software architecture, you don’t really know what to start looking for, and some of the terminology may be confusing and you wouldn’t know if you’re actually looking at what you’re supposed to be looking at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to a forums dedicated to software architecture and have someone who actually knows what a good starting place is, provide you links. This way, you know it’s a good starting place, and you can trust that the links you’ve been given aren’t irrelevant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What no one here is understanding is the fact that when you get information from people directly from a community that you can trust, you’re going to be confident that you’re getting proper information on something you don’t know. However, if you do a simple Google search, you can never be sure you’re getting the correct information. If you think about it, not only Java uses classes, so does PHP, C++, etc. Same with methods and objects. Sk8r dude was kind enough to give him useful links that he can be sure are relevant. So why are people bitching? He got what he was looking for, absolutely no point in saying, “oh wow, gee, why can’t you just use Google, it’s not that hard, gosh. LMGTFY. Wow.

Ask better questions, get better answers.</p>

Yeah I understand. I was hoping somebody would provide a more noob friendly explanation (some websites have one but it isn’t really all that clear) I know better now though.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Then I think you should have worded the question a bit better.<br>
“I’ve read on  about  but they weren’t clear enough for me. Can someone help me understand  better?”[/quote]</p>
<p>Also, they’re bitching because it took me a whole 8 seconds to find all those links, he has the resources to find them himself.</p>

here’s the thing, asking a question is fine. We’ve all asked a million and one questions, but you’re asking someone to help you, someone to spend their time helping you. They’ll only willingly do that if it looks like you put some effort into trying to help yourself. A better way to approach this situation would be for you to have read through the documentation (through a quick google search on your own) then said look guys I’ve read all of this but I’m still struggling underestanding the differences between x,y and z.<br>
You’re more likely to get an informative response that way ;)[/quote]</p>

<p>Okay moron, let’s take a look.<br>
So you’ve asked someone to provide an explanation of a programming concept, right? Or at least provide resources, no? You then thank the sk8er dude for linking you to the documentation Oracle provides. The thing is buddy, all that information can be found from doing a simple Google search. Too much effort, right? Too hard to get of your ass and do some leg work?</p>
<p>You were asking to be spoonfed because you have made zero effort to look up anything yourself. How can you argue that this isn’t the case? You replied to the sk8er dude with, “thank you so much”. Obviously the resources that he provided, you deemed as useful. RESOURCES THAT ARE SO EASY TO FIND. Let’s play a game you halfwit. Let me do a google search and I’ll post the first 10 results. Let’s see if they are related. We can call the game, ‘Teaching a nitwit’. It’ll be fun and you can tell all your other nitwit friends at school that the nerd ‘who makes graphs and has been registered for 8 years’ included you.</p>
<p>Let’s keep it simple. We don’t want to challenge you. I’ll google, ‘what is a class java’. I can break down how that search works if you like? No? I’ll continue.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/class.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/class.html</a><br>

Here’s a video. That’s perfect for you. After all, reading through any tutorials is too much effort. :(<img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

Oh look, something else that addresses your problem. It’s almost like these were easy to find?!?!</p>

Brain overflow, amirite?!</p>
<p>Actually, I’ll stop here. Obviously you’re not looking to be spoonfed, so ten different resources would be too much. Look at silly old me, getting ahead of myself. Do you know why we chose to bash you around a little? For your own god. You see, the people here have actually studied compsci. I know, hard to believe. What’s even more amazing is that we have to use Google more times than your mother tried to use a coat hanger during her pregnancy. We understand the value of doing your own research and putting effort in. Life is about putting in the hard work. Life is about trying something with effort and THEN asking for help. You haven’t even stated what your current understanding is. It’s like you’ve just thrown up your hands and said, “nuh, someone gives me it”. That’s not how it works. If you were actually interested in the concepts, you would be frantically googling around because that’s sure as hell what I did. That’s what a lot of us did.</p>
<p>Do you think you’re being bullied? Is that it? Because I’ll tell you now that anyone starting off here a few years ago had it a lot harder than you. How I’ve responded to your lazy post is actually pretty tame. So now let’s move on to your little joke about graphs and eight years. For someone who finds spending time at a community pathetic, it’s pretty funny that you’ve chosen here to beg for help. Help is the wrong word. Sorry. spoonfeeding. If it’s so bad being here then why are you still here?</p>
<p>The graphs were meant as some fun bits of content. It’s a forum after all. We can’t just have a thousand posts begging for help like yours. We had that for a little while back when we focused around private servers. You would have fit in nicely with everyone. They loved being spoonfed as well.</p>
<p>Bug off. Idiots like you ruined this community and I hate the type of person that expects everything to be handed to them. As a bonus, I’ve left all my mistyping and grammatical errors in here because I wouldn’t want to spoonfed you English. You’re not that type of guy, amirite?</p>

<p>But at the same time… Why AP if you don’t even know what methods/classes/objects are? Should you be taking an introduction class or something?</p>
