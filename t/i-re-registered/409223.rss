    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-re-registered/409223</link>
    <description>[font=arial]If this is allowed i would like to re-join the community for one reason...
I have changed and i wish to be on good terms with everyone this time around.
Davidi - im sorry about the idiot i was being last time around. EDIT: i really hate the things i said to you and about you, we have more in common than you think :)
Amerika - sorry i got you banned from this forum, idk if you&#39;re even around as a registered user but i would like to attempt to make peace with you.
Pure - Where&#39;d you go bro 0.0
Anyone else i offended please tell me, for those of you who dont know who i am. I was a trolling stupid fuck who acted on the forums as a self righteous idiot, i used to be respected but on days that i got bored i fucked up and asked to be banned publicly. 

I have returned to apologize if anything, if you ban me please tell me if you accept that apology. And to my friends mcbeans and charlie who set up my proxy site, i&#39;m sorry for letting you down.

I have returned to re-gain the respect i once had as a user that helped this community.[/font]</description>

Davidi is the only person I know on this list… What exactly did you do wrong?<br>
[/quote]<br>
before you registered, i made a second account after being banned once just to flame at david. i was a stupid fuck and i now really do feel bad about the things i said.[/quote]Flame is a bit of an understatement. You threatened to hack me, said you could easily do a SQL injection into the forums to retrieve my (hashed) password, something about owning a botnet to attack me, etc etc etc</p>
<p>Not to mention you stole programming and claimed it as your own (GML all over again, rather a coincidence you show up just a few days after he was banned? dunno :P)</p>
<p>You’re a compulsive liar as well, saying anything to impress</p>
<p>But hey, maybe you have changed. Not for me to decide. Contact an admin.</p>

<p>I was browsing for about 1.5 years? before I registered and never really payed attention to the comment’s or name’s, I was just a leecher kid, that downloaded and hosted leeched server’s, and took tutorials and never gave credit. Yup, that was awhile ago though. I don’t do that anymore :D[/quote]<br>
yeah you probably saw me on the general discussion alot then.</p>

              <p>[font=arial]If this is allowed i would like to re-join the community for one reason…<br>
I have changed and i wish to be on good terms with everyone this time around.<br>
Davidi - im sorry about the idiot i was being last time around. EDIT: i really hate the things i said to you and about you, we have more in common than you think <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Amerika - sorry i got you banned from this forum, idk if you’re even around as a registered user but i would like to attempt to make peace with you.<br>
Pure - Where’d you go bro 0.0<br>
Anyone else i offended please tell me, for those of you who dont know who i am. I was a trolling stupid fuck who acted on the forums as a self righteous idiot, i used to be respected but on days that i got bored i fucked up and asked to be banned publicly.</p>
<p>I have returned to apologize if anything, if you ban me please tell me if you accept that apology. And to my friends mcbeans and charlie who set up my proxy site, i’m sorry for letting you down.</p>
<p>I have returned to re-gain the respect i once had as a user that helped this community.[/font]</p>
