</aside>
<p>Yes we should be there to begin, thats not the only reason we’re there. Saddam and his nuke threats played a big role, and hes always wanted to take control of the oil wells in Kuwait (like he tried in desert storm). WORLDS oil supply + Nukes = ???</p>

Iraq itself was not a threat no, but Saddam was very much a threat along with the terrorists inside Iraq. Those countries are not supplying weapons to Iraq, unless you mean being sold which is a different story. The terrorist organizations grow opium and sell it to fund their weapons. IIRC Iran and Iraq hate each other and have been in constant war/skirmishes and Saudi Arabia is our ally. The middle east is the biggest supplier of opium in the world.</p>
<p>The war was justified believe it or not, we had very good reason to go over there. But we shouldnt have been there for this long trying to do what we are doing now. You cant get enough information about the war from 2001-2003 to see why we went over, you’ll have to date back to 1960.</p>
<p>To go back to Yz’s first comment, as it goes with this reply also, there were many bombings before that. Not many in America that were successful, they came in threats. The terrorist organizations that were in Iraq were a threat to surrounding countries, as they constantly attacked Israel, which played another big role in the invasion as Israel is one of your biggest allies.</p>

Wiki-leaks has been wrong before, and we’ve proved that already on these forums once. And alot of the times they just leak basic elements of war which no one has experienced so it seems “harsh”. I have read a couple, that was posted a while back also.</p>

        <p>The term ally is thrown around far too loosely. These days, you’ll call someone who you’re not bombing the shit out of an ally. Saudi Arabia is full of the leaders of Al Qaeda and other terrorist organisations that are directly against the US, UK and their allies.</p>
<p>Like I said, I was quite a fan of Blair, but looking back at it, I don’t buy a thing him and Bush said about there being WMDs under Saddam’s control. The US, the biggest military power in the world with a budget that dwarves everyone elses, the UK, the biggest military power in Europe, second biggest in NATO and these two mistakenly thought they he had WMDs?  Really? Do you really believe that countries and their massive military budget couldn’t find out previously that Saddam had WMDs before spending trillions into invading the country? Don’t be so naive.</p>
<p>Also, Wikileaks releases untouched, raw documents too, don’t they? How are they wrong? Of course, there is probably bias in their summaries, but the information source isn’t wrong.</p>

The fact that we literally flew/shipped the missiles over to them during the Iraq&amp;Iran war and they were not found years later and they were not used.</p>
<p>But heres some sauce <a href="http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/iraqchron">http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/iraqchron</a> They described it as a margin, they mainly only got the chance to inspect weapon storage facilities and weapon development factories.</p>

<p>Yes we should be there to begin, thats not the only reason we’re there. Saddam and his nuke threats played a big role, and hes always wanted to take control of the oil wells in Kuwait (like he tried in desert storm). WORLDS oil supply + Nukes = ???</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You know perfectly well that Saddam didn’t ever have nukes, yet you still bring it up. What is wrong with you? And as for the oil in Kuwait, the US military and other forces were at the time stationed in Saudi Arabia since 1991, already protecting the oil from an attack which was clearly not going to happen.</p>

<p>Iraq itself was not a threat no, but Saddam was very much a threat along with the terrorists inside Iraq. Those countries are not supplying weapons to Iraq, unless you mean being sold which is a different story. The terrorist organizations grow opium and sell it to fund their weapons. IIRC Iran and Iraq hate each other and have been in constant war/skirmishes and Saudi Arabia is our ally. The middle east is the biggest supplier of opium in the world.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There were no ‘terrorist organizations’ in Iraq until America invaded. They all formed after Saddam’s government was overthrown. You clearly don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Afghanistan used to be the biggest supplier of Opium in the world until the Taliban took power. Once they took power, the Taliban reduced opium production to only about 2% of the world’s opium - something which none of the coalition countries are currently capable of doing. After the US ousted the Taliban, opium production in Afghanistan flourished and once again became the largest in the world. I’ve already mentioned this in a previous debate, I don’t know why you pretend you don’t know it.</p>
<p>[quote=“Frell, post:24, topic:365555”]The war was justified believe it or not, we had very good reason to go over there. But we shouldnt have been there for this long trying to do what we are doing now. You cant get enough information about the war from 2001-2003 to see why we went over, you’ll have to date back to 1960.</p>
<p>To go back to Yz’s first comment, as it goes with this reply also, there were many bombings before that. Not many in America that were successful, they came in threats. The terrorist organizations that were in Iraq were a threat to surrounding countries, as they constantly attacked Israel, which played another big role in the invasion as Israel is one of your biggest allies.[/quote]</p>
<p>What? Iraq was a US ally all up until the late 1980s. What happened in the 60s which influenced this war? And which fucking terrorist organizations attacked Israel from Iraq? The only time Iraq EVER attacked Israel was when the Americans intervened in the gulf war.</p>
<p>“We torture them, they torture us. Its been like that for thousands of years” - Yet you still haven’t provided a single example where any Iraqi/Afghani ever tortured an American.</p>

Saddam and his nuke threats played a big role, and hes always wanted to take control of the oil wells in Kuwait (like he tried in desert storm). WORLDS oil supply + Nukes = ???</p>

<p>You know perfectly well that Saddam didn’t ever have nukes, yet you still bring it up. What is wrong with you? And as for the oil in Kuwait, the US military and other forces were at the time stationed in Saudi Arabia since 1991, already protecting the oil from an attack which was clearly not going to happen.[/quote]<br>
Really? Then youll enjoy reading my news post about the news released today about how we’ve been finding wmd’s in iraq since the invasion.</p>

<p>[quote=“Radeon, post:32, topic:365555”]What? Iraq was a US ally all up until the late 1980s. What happened in the 60s which influenced this war? And which fucking terrorist organizations attacked Israel from Iraq? The only time Iraq EVER attacked Israel was when the Americans intervened in the gulf war.</p>
<p>“We torture them, they torture us. Its been like that for thousands of years” - Yet you still haven’t provided a single example where any Iraqi/Afghani ever tortured an American.[/quote]<br>
As to the attacks on Isreal, this was another fault of mine. I was thinking of Pakistan. I dont recall Iraq ever attacking Israel, I dont even think Iraq is hostile to Isreal. Sorry about saying 1960s, I do not know why i said that. Lol at the comment about the Gulf War intervention. I dont think you realize what would have happened if we didnt go into the gulf war. Not only the risk of not joining, but we also gave Saddam a timeframe to leave kuwait which he happily ignored.<br>
Al qaeda has a handbook also <a href="http://newsbusters.org/node/13002">http://newsbusters.org/node/13002</a> <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/torture-al-qaeda-style">http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/torture-al-qaeda-style</a></p>
<blockquote>And yet such false stories as the “flushed Koran” got widespread play in the newspapers and on television.
<p>We are hearing those awful “Sounds of Silence” that Simon and Garfunkel warned us about.</p>
<p>Whether intentional or not, the message is clear: The United States must be above even false reports of torture, <span class="bbcode-b">while the enemy is allowed to promote eye removal, blowtorching skin and horrors I won’t go into.</span></p>
<p>The handbook shows that the enemy really is perverted and that its “cause” has less to do with global politics or any religion; they are sickos who like to torture people.</p>
<p>As much as I admire and respect John McCain’s war service, he is wrong when he says our interrogation methods encourage the enemy to torture our people. The enemy was torturing and beheading people well before 9/11.</p>
<p>That this does not disturb so many newspaper editors is in itself disturbing.</p>

<p>The shit gets posted here when 90% of this forum is liberal/leftist and it makes you feel good that you can be a majortity-minority in something. I mean really, post anticonservative/antiwar/antianything and get 2-3 people to go on the defensive (Frell, MITB, etc.) while 20-30 people agree and help attack the 3-5 minority majority. I mean lets all agree that nobody here is going to change anyone elses views, I’m pretty sure it hasn’t happened since this forum has been opened. I mean I still think American cars are shit, and MITB still thinks foreign cars are shit and I don’t think that is changing anytime soon.</p>

So it all comes down to your opinion, and my opinion is no greater than yours, so in the end who gives a fuck.</p>
