<p>This is how America* spreads freedom and democracy:</p>
<p>step 1: Bomb the fuck out of the country<br>
step 2: Convince the people that you only bombed them to bring them peace<br>
step 3: Set up a corrupt government which is exponentially worse than the previous one</p>
<p>Mitb, this is the face of the American imposed Iraqi government. This is what the coalition is losing thousands of men to defend.</p>
<p>*It is not only America defending this government, rather it includes an array of US-cock-sucking countries:</p>
<ol>
<li>Albania</li>
<li>Armenia</li>
<li>Austrailia</li>
<li>Azerbaijan</li>
<li>Bosnia and Herzegovina</li>
<li>Bulgaria</li>
<li>Czech Republic</li>
<li>Denmark</li>
<li>El Salvador</li>
<li>Estonia</li>
<li>Georgia</li>
<li>Japan</li>
<li>Kazakhstan</li>
<li>South Korea</li>

<li>Lithuania</li>

<li>Italy</li>
<li>Netherlands</li>
<li>Portugal</li>
<li>Slovenia</li>

<p>If your country is listed there, I hope you enjoy paying tax to supply the tools which the Iraqi police/army use to torture people.</p>
<p>Edit: I should mention that all those countries except the USA have retreated from Iraq.</p>

@1 More like invade and bomb the opium fields and main terrorist headquarters. Hitler on Britain is "bomb the fuck out"
@2 Tell* people why they were bombed, odds are they wont listen to us and listen to bullshit propaganda probably produced by the organizations that we're after and distort their perception of why we're there.
@3 Try to set up a government that wont work when the country wont cooperate because of fear and the constant need of power by extremist factions.

<p>This thread is about torture on behalf of the US-backed Iraqi government, but it’s good you reminded us that the US government is just as evil.</p>
<p>And as for ‘What the Terrorist due to their captured’ it really depends on what terrorists you’re talking about. If you’re talking about the Taliban/Alqaeda/sunni-iraqis/hamas, then you’ll be surprised to find out that they don’t practice torture. They either kill the captured, or release them unharmed.</p>

<p>But it does depend on who captures you. Seeing as how the orders for torture were only allowed to be for Al Qaeda and the Taliban they must have been caught torturing also.</p>

<p>It started being documented at that point. Lets not forget all of Saddam’s issues. Extremists have been there for a very long time.</p>
<p>The war should have gone like this<br>
UN votes Saddam out of power of Iraq<br>
He doesnt listen, we go over, he is forcefully removed<br>
chill there till someone new is in power (not try to re-do the government)<br>
leave.</p>
<p>Democracy is a type of rule that has to be built, not put into place. We cant get everyone in Iraq together and preach an idea without giving the extremists more of a reason to cause mayhem. And if the people in Iraq show support they put themselves and their families at risk. Its a no-win.</p>

then you’ll be surprised to find out that they don’t practice torture. They either kill the captured, or release them unharmed.<br>

You’re right the Taliban are harmless.<br>

<p>But it does depend on who captures you. Seeing as how the orders for torture were only allowed to be for Al Qaeda and the Taliban they must have been caught torturing also.[/quote]<br>
As I said, they either kill the captured or release them unharmed. Their method of execution is beheading and even if you consider it torture, it’s much less painful than any US ‘harsh interrogation’ technique as it is only takes seconds before the person is killed.</p>

Yeah umm… the killing only ever started after US intervention.<br>
[/quote]<br>
It started being documented at that point. Lets not forget all of Saddam’s issues. Extremists have been there for a very long time.[/quote]<br>
Again if you’re referring to Alqaeda or other sunni/shia factions, they only came into existence after the invasion.</p>
<p>It’s good you mention Saddam. <span class="bbcode-s">Do you know why he gassed the kurds? iirc it was only after the CIA empowered kurdish militias to attempt a military coupé which they failed.</span></p>
<p>Saddam gassed the kurds prior to the first gulf war and I couldn’t find any sources indicating that it was a result of CIA provocation. However after the first gulf war, the CIA did encourage certain elements to attempt a military coupé.</p>
<blockquote>In the North, Kurdish leaders took American statements that they would support an uprising to heart, and began fighting, hoping to trigger a coup d'état. However, when no American support came, Iraqi generals remained loyal to Saddam and brutally crushed the Kurdish uprising. Millions of Kurds fled across the mountains to Kurdish areas of Turkey and Iran.</blockquote>

The CIA most certainly practices water boarding. Stress positions are used heavily too, as is sensory deprivation and sleep deprivation. Believe it or not, combinations of these are all more effective than your old-school beatings 99% of the time.[/quote]</p>
<p>They use other techniques too. Here’s a video which was supposedly captured by alqaeda featuring a CIA interrogator torturing an innocent Afghani. There’s no way of verifying this but I think it’s obvious from viewing the video that it is genuine.</p>

        <pre><code> Im tired of this shit. War never changes, it wont change, it cant change. We torture them, they torture us. Its been like that for thousands of years and just because someone brings it up again makes it a big deal? The tortures are very horrible, more horrible than usual. Shows you how much hostility Iraq has towards the suspects, they clearly don't want us out if we're helping them fight what they've been dealing with for years. As for the country, its made no progression in this world. Iraq was practically dirt until they found oil, and the money still wasnt used to fix it. Its a horrible place to live, the 2003 invasion was supposed to change this and give the country a chance for democracy and self progression. Instead the inhabitants resist and it stirs up the factions and literally makes the place hell. Believe me, we want out. But theres this thing that America has were they rebuild the damage they've done, in this case, the result of Saddam's regime resistance at the start of the invasion. We wouldnt be over there so long if we thought the country didnt have a chance. Any time a country has a chance to be free, we step in. But when the people are so brainwashed and scared that they cant rap their heads around what a free world is like, or how to live under a democracy it wont work, and it cant work. Its a lost cause. That is what Vietnam, Korea, and Iraq are all about. Along with that, it and (mostly) Iran were such a threat to neighboring countries we had to go and sort it out. While the rest of the coalition pussied out we had to stay and do the dirty work. So why complain about it?

Its so easy to pull this shit off, take a video of a suspect being tortured or a house being raided, throw the word innocent or civilian in there and you got a bunch of people fired up with a false fuse. Lets take a video of a muslim in new york pulling a gun out in public and getting tackled by the police. But lets cut out the gun drawing part and add a title like "US shows constant hostility and hate towards muslims in America - Video of an innocent being tackled and beaten in the street.</p>
