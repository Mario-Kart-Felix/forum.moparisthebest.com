<p>You do not insert anything. You’d just remove the semicolon.</p>
<p>Assuming all methods and variables exist, this would be working code:</p>
<p><code>if (itemId == 995) {
	if (!player.getInventory().containsItem(995, Integer.MAX_VALUE)) {
		return;// If player does not have max money in inventory, return false.
	}
	// Obviously they have max cash, as the above statement didn't return false.
	player.getInventory().deleteItem(995, Integer.MAX_VALUE); // Delete items before adding, in case their inventory is full.
	player.getInventory().addItem(12183, 1000000);// Add item
	player.getPackets().sendGameMessage("&lt;col=00FF00&gt;You just received max cash for opening a Max Cash Pouch!&lt;/col&gt;");// Send a game message.

That’d be my bad. I missed it in the copy paste.</p>

I assumed you needed the return true/false because that is what you supplied in the original code. void methods (ones that return nothing) don’t need to return true or false, just return.</p>
