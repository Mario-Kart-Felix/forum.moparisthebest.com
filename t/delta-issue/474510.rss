    <title>[Delta] Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-issue/474510</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve found that my delta project has an issue, and even after conversation with Strucker, I can&#39;t seem to fix it.
Basically, I&#39;ve discovered that either my game either has a memory leak or just takes it&#39;s sweet time when it comes to loading my spawned objects and npc&#39;s.

The game has a lag when you log in, and every time you teleport, and there is a 10-second delay before you can interact in any way, due to everything loading slowly.

I have 2 resolutions to this, both of which I don&#39;t know how to do:

1) Find the memory leak and fix it

2) Suggested by Strucker, to edit the cache so that spawned objects and npc&#39;s are loaded as the game bar loads up the client.

Anyone can help me do either one?</description>
