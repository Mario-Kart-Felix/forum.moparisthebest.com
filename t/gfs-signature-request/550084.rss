    <description>i would like my theme to have something related to wealth, or if you could, related to rsps pk

i&#39;d like the text to be : GfServerMaker1 ( a color, any color, that fits with a red/fire looking background )

A smooth texture, something that is very easy, smooth like glass, but not shiny.

i would like the font to be something more fancy, but easily readable, not too &quot; fancy &quot; but something nice.</description>
