    <title>Wilderness &amp; free trade coming back 1st feb</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wilderness-free-trade-coming-back-1st-feb/378770</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Thank you to all those of you who took part in the historic RuneScape Referendum, which ended on Friday. We received an incredible 1.2 million votes, with a united 91% of you voting for the restoration of free trade and the Wilderness. We have heard your call and will be restoring these much loved features to RuneScape on Tuesday 1st February.

The clock is ticking and you have just two weeks to get ready for this monumental update. To help you prepare, we will be releasing a series of guides, FAQs and expert advice about the Wilderness and free trade, so that players both old and new can get ready for this epic release.

Now it is up to you to prepare for battle, level your account, gear up your armour and equip yourself for the ultimate Wilderness experience.

There is just one question left unanswered: are you ready?

Mark Gerhard and the RuneScape Team&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>haha lol I remember I used to keep a lot of cheap junk in my bank and there would always be like a level 100+ guy in a bank who is always in a rush and offers like 10k for a  knife or a pie dish or shit like that - really liked their generosity, if it was me I’d have walked to the nearest general store (regardless how far it was) cuz I’m noob…</p>

What this will do however, is make the community a lot tighter, and i intend to be very generous when it comes to shit in-game (i always had a soft spot for watching a noob cum all over himself after providing him with 100k cash) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
