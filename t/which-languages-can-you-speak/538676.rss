    <title>Which languages can you speak?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-languages-can-you-speak/538676</link>
    <description>Which languages can you speak beyond a tourist-survival level? (being able to say your name, age and ask for directions does not count. You should be able to hold a conversation in the language to be considered &quot;able to speak it&quot; :P)

I can speak English and am near-fluent in Spanish, and I am currently learning Portuguese.</description>

<p>French, German and Spanish are the main ones. You can take exams in most other languages (and gain qualifications in them) if you are willing to study them outside of school. This is my aim with Portuguese.[/quote]<br>
In the Netherlands, in high school, you get up to 2 years of French, German, which are compulsory subjects, I have chosen to continue to learn these languages.</p>

              <p>I can have simple conversations in Spanish, and I’ve been wanting to teach myself Russian for a while.  I’m going to wait until I’m done with High school to start Russian though.  It’d be too confusing trying to learn Spanish and Russian at the same time.</p>
<p>Oh and I can obviously speak English.</p>

              <p>Which languages can you speak beyond a tourist-survival level? (being able to say your name, age and ask for directions does not count. You should be able to hold a conversation in the language to be considered “able to speak it” :P)</p>
<p>I can speak English and am near-fluent in Spanish, and I am currently learning Portuguese.</p>
