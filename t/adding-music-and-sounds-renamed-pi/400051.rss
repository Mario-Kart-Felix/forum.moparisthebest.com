    <title>Adding Music and Sounds [RENAMED/PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-music-and-sounds-renamed-pi/400051</link>
    <description>Ok, so I have a basic idea of how to do this (music not sounds).

I have all the client shit set up (a music player and all) and all I need help with is sounds and music. My idea for music is in the isInArea code, you set it to play that track. But I need to know how t do that. Please help out!
