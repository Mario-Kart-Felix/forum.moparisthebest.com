    <description>As we all know, Runescape has thousands of dormant accounts, many of them with millions, even billions worth in items. We have a chance to form together and dig up some of these accounts. Profits will be fairly split throughout the team, as it IS a team. Just fill out an application to join:

How long have you played Runescape:
How good are you at getting information:
How many accounts you have recovered:
Any extra information/ proof:</description>

              <p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:1288, topic:410849”]We’ve decided this is against the rules. We can’t control the activity of the users outside of the forum, and at first I thought this was only recovering dormant accounts for your own use, but this has become an enterprise and you guys aren’t caring how inactive accounts are or anything. So from this point on, no discussion of recovering accounts.</p>
<p>You can see the updated rule in the rule topic for this section.</p>
<p>No one will be punished for anything done before this change.[/quote]</p>
<p>EDIT - I also deleted any incriminating replies</p>
