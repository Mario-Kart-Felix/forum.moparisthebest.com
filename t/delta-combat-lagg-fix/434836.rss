    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-combat-lagg-fix/434836</link>
    <description>Hey Mopar. I&#39;m currently coding a Delta source and I would like to know how to fix the combat delay that the delta sources come with. I know this has been a big problem for deltas and I would like to know how to fix it.
Any suggest will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</description>
