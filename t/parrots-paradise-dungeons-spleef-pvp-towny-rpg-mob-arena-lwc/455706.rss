Info: 

A new fun server based on a desert theme park filled with events, which will include roller coasters, fishing competitions, temple mazes, pyramid triathalons(race to the top to reach the prize!!), mob arenas with puzzles and specialized classes, pvp arenas in roman style colleusium!
 A peaceful place where people can build without grief, however, once you enter the pvp portal , it&#39;s an all out battle! Fight in the name of Ares from his Castle and become a champion!
 We have our main world as PVE and our sub world as PVP. So you decide when you want to fight or pray for forgiveness at the cathedral 

We use precious stones so you can protect your home from griefing.(Gold Block) We disabled creeper explosions in protected places to protect your home exteriors.
 
There is a mall for players to make their shops,as you can see in the Screenshot, many more attractions to come .
