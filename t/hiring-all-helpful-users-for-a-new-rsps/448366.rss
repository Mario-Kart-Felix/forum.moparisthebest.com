    <title>Hiring all helpful users for a new RSPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hiring-all-helpful-users-for-a-new-rsps/448366</link>
    <description>The title says it all, I&#39;m currently working on re-opening a RSPS which will be without a doubt successful. I can afford advertising campaigns, Moparscape sponsorship, a fast and reliable dedicated server for hosting and also a good web host for our forums. If you are interested please check below if you are good at any of them listed.

Are you: 

Good at Graphics? -: Flash / Photoshop
A good Web Designer? -: Html / Php / Css
A good Server coder? -: Javascript
A good securer? -: Stop glitches / Prevent DDOS attacks / Cover up exploitations in the website / system

If you are any of them above please do contact my Skype or PM me on here. If not but think you can still help
the server out, aka Advertising / Financial causes, please contact me.

Skype: Jackhampson

Thankyou for your time.</description>

              <p>Don’t remake topics just because your others were locked. Make sure that you follow the section rules. There are not nearly enough details here to qualify as a real development team post. I suggest you look at the stickies and other development threads to see what yours should look like.</p>
<p>Remember: If you can’t put the effort in to trying to make your thread look good, why should anyone bother putting any effort into your development?</p>
