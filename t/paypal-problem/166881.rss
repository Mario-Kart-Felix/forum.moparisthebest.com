[quote=&quot;Paypal&quot;]The amount of this transaction exceeds your remaining sending limit and cannot be processed at this time.

    * You will need to add and confirm your bank account. Once your bank account has been added and confirmed, you can continue this payment. Add your bank account information below.[/quote]

Can anyone help on how I can use up $10.00 for a domain... And yes I know I need to put a Bank Account on it, but i don&#39;t want to, any other ways? Or does anyone know a good site that offers domains that are cheaper then $10.00? Thanks.</description>
