    <title>[562] Player Data Variables [562]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-player-data-variables-562/396988</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m using CorruptionX&#39;s 562 Source, and I&#39;m wondering, where are all the player variables stored, not the .xml file, but where does it read out of the source to write &#39;them&#39; variables, this does make much sence.

Okay, So I&#39;ll use the 317 as an example.
There is a code in the Client.java, that is something like BufferedReader.Writerorwhatever(&quot;kills = &quot;);

Now is that in the 562 source? If it is where is it, I&#39;ve been searching around for about 20minutes trying to find it, the closest thing if found was XStreamPlayerLOADER, yes I know its loader, but I was looking for clues, so does someone want to help me? Any help is much appresiateddeddedddd, d.

EDIT.

I fixed it, turns out you have to compile your source -epic facepalm- :/</description>
