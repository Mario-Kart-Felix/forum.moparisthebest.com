    <description>Well recently, I&#39;ve been getting crashed by kids who are using Syi pkers, with a bunch of numbers in there names, and its lowering my system so it lags a lot.
I was wondering if anyone had a guide or something, because now i&#39;m getting threatened for not giving the kid admin, and I know he is the real deal, he showed me.

Rep will be givin if you solve this problem!</description>

You go into character files and find the syi’s acc name and go into it, it should have an ip put that ip into the ip ban.txt file.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>
