    <description>Ok well for a while now i havent been able to connect to any server&#39;s , unless it is hamachi..
I am currently running a server off No-Ip . I have tried everything to connect to a server through silab&#39;s but no luck - infact NO client allows me to connect.

I have deleted the forwarded port&#39;s , i have shut off No-Ip , i have used several Clients and dont tell me the server&#39;s offline i have tried every server including 24/7&#39;s , even servers that Rune_Locus say are online , even servers that arent on server status..Im extremely pissed of because i have tried everything..
