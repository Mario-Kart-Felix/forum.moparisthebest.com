<p><a href="http://www.escalononline.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">www.escalononline.com</a></p>
<p>Overview:</p>
<blockquote>The game takes place in the land of Escalon, a large continent surrounded by several islands.
<p>The game is open world concept, meaning, there is no strict adherence to a storyline or end of game concept. However there are many events that are considered important to the overall state of Escalon (political, social etc), and many of the stories connect in some way.</p>
<p>An Introduction to the Main Plot:</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Escalon lived their lives without much thought of tomorrow. Order reigned and peace guided the peoples, even among the different races for a few thousand years.</p>
<p>They hadn’t forgotten their dark past however. For it was in 50 AC (After Creation) that a great and bloody war of Dragons was waged. The “Dark Dragons”, unjust and full of hate for mankind, fought the “Mystic Dragons”, those who enforced order, to obtain the Rod of Power: the ultimate source of all magic. In the end, the Mystic Dragons won the war and placed the rod deep within a cave which is guarded by Gnomish Seers even to this day. If it were to fall in the wrong hands, the magic of the rod could be limited to those who had control of it.</p>
<p>Now the Dragons have become old and their tales are becoming but a fading memory. Yet their wisdom is saught often, especially in times of trouble. And troublesome times are these indeed. In an attempt to seize the Rod of Power a group of wicked men known as the Illuminated Ones have used their magic to hypnotize powerful creatures and men to do their bidding. They instigate trouble wherever their feet take them, leaving behind a trail of dark mist and a feeling of dread comes to any who meet them.</p>
<p>On the southwest tip of Escalon, near Vandale a strange unknown ship has crashed and some of it’s passengers now wash up on Vandale Beach. They are unaware of how this story affects them, or what role they will play in the kingdoms’ survival. Take a journey through the world Escalon to discover your past and future in these perilous times.</p>

<p>Trailer:<br>
[youtube]<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymQLyg03P6c%5B/youtube%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymQLyg03P6c[/youtube]</a></p>
<p>Classes:</p>
<blockquote>Knight: Protector of the realms. The Knight is a melee focused class who takes the brunt in battle. A Knight can cast close combat magic.
<p>Bard: Singer of Songs. The Bard is a charismatic type whose songs can inspire or defeat. A Bard specializes in buff type magic, to increase or decrease stats.</p>
<p>Ranger: Friend of Nature and Law enforcerer. The Ranger upholds order in Escalon and keeps his heart in tune with natural magic. A Ranger can cast healing spells and weaken foes.</p>
<p>Thief: Swift and Sneaky. The Thief is similiar to a Ranger except that he likes to break the rules. A Thief can steal from opponents, and perform stealth attacks.</p>
<p>Shaman: Diviner of Animal Spirits.  A Shaman focuses his mind to heal the wounded, or cast mind-detering skills on enemies. They can also transform into various creatures.</p>
<p>Wizard: Wielder of Great Magic. The Wizard is a magic focused class. Wizard’s have extremely powerful offensive magic, having mastered the elements.</p>
<p>Oracle: Mystical Visionary. The Oracle uses their prophetic power to both heal and harm. An Oracle is fragile, but makes up for it with an equal mix of offensive and defensive magic.</p>
<p>At level 50 you can switch jobs, to mix Job skills. For example, a Knight turned Shaman could use Knight skills and Shaman skills respectively.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mini-Games - Throughout Escalon are people who like to play mini games. For example: Pick a Chest, Gambling etc

<li>Some side notes, my name is John. I’m the head developer for Escalon Online.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a small side project a friend and myself have been working on, he handles most of the things graphics related and i do pretty much anything programming related.</p>
<p>I believe most of the tiles are his, although he is borrowing quite a few of the Character sprites from various games until we can come up with a full set of our own. Also, the fishing system is rather different since this video was made, it no longer consists of a GUI but rather a interactive sound/click based fishing system. It’s a bit hard to explain but i will get a video up soon going into depth.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,<br>
John</p>

        <p>Hey this looks very cool actually. A lot of ideas are unique in this game, but you also have a lot of stuff taken from pokemon. The graphics are cool, but you need to work on the controls/interface graphics.</p>
<p>like on the bottom, you could put those 12 boxes transparent on the bottom and make the chatbox by itself a little transparent in the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>Hope I helped, nice Banner by the way, the dragon as the E is very cool!</p>
<p>Good luck and keep up the cool work!<br>
(Nice music with the video)</p>

        <p>Thanks for the kind words of advice!</p>
<p>Currently the project is at a halt, this happened to be developed in Visual Basic 6.0; which i dropped about two months ago when i began messing around in C#.</p>
<p>Right now I’m rebuilding the engine in C# + SlimDX, which will provide a nice base for a few games we have in mind.</p>

<p>Yes, that is 100% true.</p>
<p>And we’re working on moving away from these placeholders, actually this game will most likely be dropped and replaced with a very similar game using the same concepts, and a better story in an entirely new engine.</p>
<p>Through working on this we got some ideas of what works and what doesn’t, we’ve also decided to move away from the 16 bit sprites and head more into the 32 bit area.</p>
