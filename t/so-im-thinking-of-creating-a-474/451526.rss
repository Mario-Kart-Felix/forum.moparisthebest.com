    <title>So I&#39;m Thinking of Creating a 474</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-im-thinking-of-creating-a-474/451526</link>
    <description>Recently, I teamed up with my friend to help him on his server in hopes to make a couple bucks. After packing all sorts of data to the cache and improving the &quot;on demand fetcher&quot;, not to mention fixing a ton of poorly-done sprite customization that came with the client, it felt really dry. I wanted to make an &quot;HD&quot; version of one of the servers, but he wasn&#39;t really up for it, and plus the one he had in mind was a PK server - one I thought was a waste of the 718 client. So, I started looking some stuff up to get a 474 client with 474 or 508 maps, and I actually found one with custom-made 474 maps. Pretty neat. So after trying it out to see if it worked, I started thinking about the server.

Not too long ago I had stopped working on Rarity v2 for a number of reasons I won&#39;t get into. Rather than start a whole new server from scratch, I figured, why not build off of that? It&#39;s got a really strong core and would be easy to convert. So, that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing.

What I want to know is what kind of server should I make? The reason I chose 474 was because it has construction and hunter (the two funnest skills IMO), no grand exchange, no summoning, no ugly gameframe, and no HD stuff. It&#39;s my favorite revision by far, and I feel now is a good time to make a server. The best server I ever played was, I&#39;ll admit, a Delta server. But it was just so well-done - it had my favorite home, my favorite custom items, a public yell command, and so much more I just loved. This pretty much includes a specific home with a bunch of custom objects, multiple areas to train against monsters, bosses, and a skilling area. I have no problem with this type of server, but it just feels like I could do so much more with a 474 client.

I really want to make some sort of RuneScape recreation, but that&#39;s a huge task and I don&#39;t really remember jack shit about how it was around the 474 era. Basically, what I mean is no *true* home, a player-run economy, plenty of areas to train skills, quests, and a lot of places to visit and train combat.

What do you guys think? I&#39;m really lost here and could use some guidance. Thanks,
