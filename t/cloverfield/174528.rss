    <title>Cloverfield</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cloverfield/174528</link>
    <description>Well the idea of filming through the camera of the people in the crisis was a pretty cool idea, but this movie was hard to watch on the big screen.
The movie runs for about an hour and 20 minutes, most of this is through the shaking hands of Hud. Imagine spinning around on a tire swing for that length of time, full out spinning but stopping every 10 or so minutes for about 20 seconds, then starting again. I felt sick, my friends felt sick, most people there felt sick.

Now for the plot of Cloverfield...To tell you the truth, I didn&#39;t really feel that there was a plot. Sure stuff was happening, but it all seemed kind of random at the time. He died, she died. Smashed this shit, wish I was smashed instead. Boy loves girl, etc and I happened to miss the most exciting part of the movie, but I did catch the last bit of that part and it wasn&#39;t all [i]that[/i] exciting which can say quite a bit about the movie. 

If it was on a TV at home the filming would be fine as there is still objects everywhere, but the big screen hurt. I have a feeling I wasn&#39;t all that impressed just because I felt sick. Still go see it as I did enjoy it in the end, but prepare for that gut feeling.

I give it a 7/10

<p>4/10 - DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM (unless it is in 3d, and on a smaller screen) damn NZ screens, they are like 25x12m, and one is like 30x13m</p>

<p>A lot of people said the movie sucked but I thought it was ok.  Also people said the shaking screen made them “sick.”  I guess I must be special or something because I was fine with it.  There were also lots of parts that seemed unrealistic.</p>

              <p>The ending of that movie was so pointless.  It concluded nothing, and it left <span class="bbcode-i">too</span> much unexplained.</p>
<p>There were a few funny parts, but I don’t even know if they were intentional or not.</p>
<p>Especially when they pulled his girlfriend OFF OF A POLE THROUGH HER HEART and shes better in like 10 minutes.  She can now run around and jump into helicopters (not to mention survive a 500 ft. fall).</p>
<p>Waste of time and money imo.  Although, it did give some good discussion on the drive home <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

              <p>Well the idea of filming through the camera of the people in the crisis was a pretty cool idea, but this movie was hard to watch on the big screen.<br>
The movie runs for about an hour and 20 minutes, most of this is through the shaking hands of Hud. Imagine spinning around on a tire swing for that length of time, full out spinning but stopping every 10 or so minutes for about 20 seconds, then starting again. I felt sick, my friends felt sick, most people there felt sick.</p>
<p>Now for the plot of Cloverfield…To tell you the truth, I didn’t really feel that there was a plot. Sure stuff was happening, but it all seemed kind of random at the time. He died, she died. Smashed this shit, wish I was smashed instead. Boy loves girl, etc and I happened to miss the most exciting part of the movie, but I did catch the last bit of that part and it wasn’t all <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> exciting which can say quite a bit about the movie.</p>
<p>If it was on a TV at home the filming would be fine as there is still objects everywhere, but the big screen hurt. I have a feeling I wasn’t all that impressed just because I felt sick. Still go see it as I did enjoy it in the end, but prepare for that gut feeling.</p>
<p>I give it a 7/10</p>
