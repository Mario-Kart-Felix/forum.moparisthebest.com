    <description> :) Hiya ive played every server ever released and there have been some brilliant results  :o

But the things ive been waiting for as have many others is:

More NPCS that work when speaking etc
More fun extras 
Fishing, mining fletching etc areas fixed(not all the spots work)

That is what i think should be added to imporve the playing of private servers better because all the released packs are empty of npcs and quests and npc speech fixes and monsters attacking etc and only have skills fixed etc which is still great ;) but i am in desparate need of a release with more things in the game to do 

thx</description>
