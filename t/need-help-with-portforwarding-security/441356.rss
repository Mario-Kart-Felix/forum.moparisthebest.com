    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-portforwarding-security/441356</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, thanks for reading this. I can easily portforward, it is not hard. Although, I need help taking the security off so where it doesn&#39;t block the 43594 port. I have norton internet security. I would very much appreciate someone to help me. 

Thanks Again</description>
