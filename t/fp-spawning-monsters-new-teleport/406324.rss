    <description>I have been doing my rsps for a while, looking over guide, making it nice before i let some beta test it, but i would like to add another room and boss, and out of everything, i still have not learned how to spawn monsters......or at least get my X Y cords.

Also if you know how to add another teleport, would be thankful</description>
