    <description>I always find it funny when people say CS:GO has a better community than Call of Duty, or Battlefield. This isn&#39;t at all true, it&#39;s all the same people, and they&#39;ll do anything to win a silly little silver 3 match. Like this right here:

[img width=1024]http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/49853844538939710/80240FDACB21971D5A2BB985C787F5FBD3D24A39/[/img]

[img width=1024]http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/49853844538940940/0F2DD4906A205E43D435675F0F5C0AD1732BF2E3/[/img]

As it would so appear, no matter if its, Call of Duty, RSPS&#39;s, or CS:GO, kids love to whip out there little booter and attack whoever they can because it would make them feel powerful.

On another subject, is it a good idea to DDOS a Valve server lol?</description>

I was wondering the same thing, he could have just been bs’ing. I did however send this information to Valve, it was an official Valve server (competitive match), with what they can see I’m sure it won’t be of any help, but I did it anyways…</p>
