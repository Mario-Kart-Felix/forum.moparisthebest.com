    <title>C# Asynchronous Socket Library</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/c-asynchronous-socket-library/208130</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been working on this project for the past few weeks, and it was really quite interesting to write. C#.net has some amazing facilities built in for easy async operations, and I never even had to touch the Thread class.

The basic idea was to have one class library (dll file) that provides a BaseServerConnection and a BaseClientConnection class, along with a few other classes to facilitate the packet structuring and the event system. The BaseServerConnection is to be used for all interaction with the server on the client side, and the BaseClientConnection is to be used for all interaction with a client on the server side.

The classes aren&#39;t designed to be used directly, they should be extended, and have an event handler registered which will be called when data is received.
To make a simple client, you would do the following

[code]
using System;

using SC.Base;

namespace Example
{
    class MyServerConnection : BaseServerConnection
    {
        public SCServer()
        {
            OnDataReceived += new EventHandler&lt;DataEventArgs&gt;(Server_OnDataReceived);
        }
        private void Server_OnDataReceived(object sender, DataEventArgs e)
        {
            switch (e.Data.ID)
            {
                // Add cases for each packet ID, and get the packet&#39;s data with the e.Data.Value property
            }
        }
    }
}
[/code]

The BaseServerConnection class has a virtual method for connecting to a specified IPEndPoint, so you would just call 
[code]
MyServerConnectionInstance.BeginConnectToServer(ServerEndPoint);
[/code]

The key line in the previous example is
[code]
OnDataReceived += new EventHandler&lt;DataEventArgs&gt;(Server_OnDataReceived);
[/code]
Which registers the method Server_OnDataReceived, which must have the correct signature of 
[code]
void Server_OnDataReceived(object sender, DataEventArgs e)
[/code]
The DataEventArgs will contain the packet that was received, in it&#39;s Data property.

I have written a server and client application that utilizes the library. The server can have a massive number of simultaneously connected clients, and the clients can exchange data between each other. This is more of an example than any thing else, and it still lacks many things like sending a list of other connected clients when a new client connects. The problem with the windows CLI is that it&#39;s extremely difficult to accept keyboard input while updating output, so if you write a message, you won&#39;t be able to see any received messages until your done. This is of course easily remedied by moving to a Winforms or WPF interface, which would be quite simple to do with a few delegate cross thread methods.

One of the really cool things I&#39;ve found while exploring C# 3.0 and writing this library is extension methods, which essentially allow me to do something like this:
[code]
String s = &quot;Hello&quot;;
s.GetBytes();
[/code]
There is no GetBytes() method in the String class...and the String class is sealed (final) so I can&#39;t extend it, but I can do this:
[code]
    public static class Extentions
    {
        public static byte[] GetBytes(this String str)
        {
            return System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(str);
        }
    }
[/code]
Say what you will about being trivial and useless, but I find it&#39;s a much nicer syntax than Extentions.GetBytes(&quot;Hello&quot;);.

All in all this was just educational programming, but I might add it to my Spark3D library for a networking component in multiplayer game building.
A few more try catch blocks would probably be a good idea, but I figure I should release this before I lose interest.

If anyone would like to download it, PM me.

<p>They only let you get up to Professional, but it looks like they used to offer Ultimate Beta.

          <blockquote>
              <p>I’ve been working on this project for the past few weeks, and it was really quite interesting to write. C#.net has some amazing facilities built in for easy async operations, and I never even had to touch the Thread class.</p>
<p>The basic idea was to have one class library (dll file) that provides a BaseServerConnection and a BaseClientConnection class, along with a few other classes to facilitate the packet structuring and the event system. The BaseServerConnection is to be used for all interaction with the server on the client side, and the BaseClientConnection is to be used for all interaction with a client on the server side.</p>
<p>The classes aren’t designed to be used directly, they should be extended, and have an event handler registered which will be called when data is received.<br>
To make a simple client, you would do the following</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">using System;

using SC.Base;

namespace Example
{
    class MyServerConnection : BaseServerConnection
    {
        public SCServer()
        {
            OnDataReceived += new EventHandler&lt;DataEventArgs&gt;(Server_OnDataReceived);
        }
        private void Server_OnDataReceived(object sender, DataEventArgs e)
        {
            switch (e.Data.ID)
            {
                // Add cases for each packet ID, and get the packet's data with the e.Data.Value property
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The BaseServerConnection class has a virtual method for connecting to a specified IPEndPoint, so you would just call</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">MyServerConnectionInstance.BeginConnectToServer(ServerEndPoint);</code></pre>
<p>The key line in the previous example is</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">OnDataReceived += new EventHandler&lt;DataEventArgs&gt;(Server_OnDataReceived);</code></pre>
<p>Which registers the method Server_OnDataReceived, which must have the correct signature of</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">void Server_OnDataReceived(object sender, DataEventArgs e)</code></pre>
<p>The DataEventArgs will contain the packet that was received, in it’s Data property.</p>
<p>I have written a server and client application that utilizes the library. The server can have a massive number of simultaneously connected clients, and the clients can exchange data between each other. This is more of an example than any thing else, and it still lacks many things like sending a list of other connected clients when a new client connects. The problem with the windows CLI is that it’s extremely difficult to accept keyboard input while updating output, so if you write a message, you won’t be able to see any received messages until your done. This is of course easily remedied by moving to a Winforms or WPF interface, which would be quite simple to do with a few delegate cross thread methods.</p>
<p>One of the really cool things I’ve found while exploring C# 3.0 and writing this library is extension methods, which essentially allow me to do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">String s = "Hello";
s.GetBytes();</code></pre>
<p>There is no GetBytes() method in the String class…and the String class is sealed (final) so I can’t extend it, but I can do this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    public static class Extentions
    {
        public static byte[] GetBytes(this String str)
        {
            return System.Text.Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(str);
        }
    }</code></pre>
<p>Say what you will about being trivial and useless, but I find it’s a much nicer syntax than Extentions.GetBytes(“Hello”);.</p>
<p>All in all this was just educational programming, but I might add it to my Spark3D library for a networking component in multiplayer game building.<br>
A few more try catch blocks would probably be a good idea, but I figure I should release this before I lose interest.</p>
<p>If anyone would like to download it, PM me.</p>
<p>Edit: inb4 tl;dr</p>
