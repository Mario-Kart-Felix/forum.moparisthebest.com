    <title>Could anyone possibly deob the HD client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/could-anyone-possibly-deob-the-hd-client/220656</link>
    <description>Well me and my friend are working on a 504 server (It&#39;s now in the state that blakescape is so it&#39;s ready for development.) and we would like to start getting into the HD client and loading the JOGL Library using the loader. But I have failed on deobing the HD client so I would like it if one of you guys could deob it or take it a step further and construct it from bytecode.</description>

I doubt you’ll find much support for the 500+ series. All the better programmers of private servers seem to have left, or have lost interest.<br>
[/quote] I noticed, the ones that have posted here are stupid fuckers, zach you know i’m not stupid about this shit…[/quote]<br>
Ever wondered why you get stupid responses? Because you ask stupid questions.<br>
First of all: You want to create a server, but you aren’t capable of it in the first place.</p>
<p>If you say this:</p>
<blockquote>But I have failed on deobing the HD client so I would like it if one of you guys could deob it or take it a step further and construct it from bytecode.</blockquote>
That would mean you don't have a clue what your talking about.
What the hell do you mean with construct it from bytecode, you want us to manually decompile the whole fucking client??
If you want to deob, learn how it's obfuscated and remove it. It's not that hard, at least it's a lot easier then writing the server.

<p>You post here with private server related questions and expect our posts to be positive ones? Get real. The separation of the two communities is there for a reason. I laugh at you and what you stand for. Just leave before this thread turns to flames.</p>

I don’t view getting “player rendering on a 504/503 server” as an accomplishment, but a waste of time.</p>

              <p>Well me and my friend are working on a 504 server (It’s now in the state that blakescape is so it’s ready for development.) and we would like to start getting into the HD client and loading the JOGL Library using the loader. But I have failed on deobing the HD client so I would like it if one of you guys could deob it or take it a step further and construct it from bytecode.</p>
