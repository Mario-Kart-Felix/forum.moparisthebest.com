    <title>Addition of a &quot;Snippets&quot; child board to Server Tutorials</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/addition-of-a-snippets-child-board-to-server-tutorials/445619</link>
    <description>The title says it all, I believe this would solve a lot of issues and would gain said snippets more recognition than what they get inside the current topic they are posted inside. It&#39;d also clean up the tutorials board from another sticky at the top of the board. I realise this would be us losing a lot of snippets, however, if they are popular and people require to be reposted I&#39;d do as many as I could.</description>
