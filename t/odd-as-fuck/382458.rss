    <description>Alright, for the past 2-3 days I have been thinking minecraft.net was down, only to be told by Shrogg it still works for him. I tried it on my phone and it loaded up fine. On my laptop though, I try to go to minecraft.net or even login with the launcher and I get no connection at all. Anybody have an idea as to why my laptop cannot even get a connection to minecraft? I wanna say I musta got IP&#39;d for something (what though?), but that issue seems to be bad practice for Notch, as i barely ever got on SMP.</description>

<p>That’s what originally came to mind, but I only have 1 mod installed. Then again, after I think about it, MCCheat was put on here by my uncle. My AVG found a virus each time I ran it. Also, after thinking about it, I had multiple occurrences of those redirects in my ‘hosts’ file. I guess I shall no longer let my uncle download things, time to limit the ‘guest’ account to browsing the web, playing games, and watching movies. No downloads for him anymore <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>

<p>Well if it found viruses, i would recommend scanning with something like spyware doctor, found trojan downloaders and a bunch of other things that AVG and a bunch of other antivirus softwares couldnt find.</p>
<p>Also try malware bytes :D[/quote]<br>
To be quite honest I haven’t had a virus that’s gotten past AVG yet, not to say that I wont. I figured it out though after ripping apart the program, it was supposed to get me redirected into a fake minecraft login server that would then save my user and pass on his computer. It never sent bytes back (but it might not anyways), so I believe it was an old file or something.</p>

Possibly a “M31ncr0ft ch34t 3ng1n3”?</p>
<p>Maybe it could be a keylogger, considering it attemped to steal data via key strokes, but that possibility is eliminated, since something happened with the website, i dont think it would be a keylogger, usually for stealing any valuable info, but as MITB said, something minecraft related, made specifically for stealing minecraft private info.</p>

Alright, I tried that and it seems I am just getting no response.<br>

<p>After seeing that, I decided it wasn’t a networking problem, but maybe it wasn’t being sent correctly. After remembering what the ‘hosts’ file does, I looked there and found this.<br>

<p>I traced the IP and found he (or at least the IP) originates from Chicago (or an nearby area/internet provider, as this site is not the most accurate thing).<br>

<p>I thought of that too, so I tested it on my old laptop. The results &gt; Minecraft game wont load since it is incompatable with the OpenGL my video card on there supports, but the minecraft site loads just fine. There has gotta b something going on internally with my computer. I guess I’ll see about forcing a scan with my antivirus.</p>

              <p>Alright, for the past 2-3 days I have been thinking <a href="http://minecraft.net" rel="nofollow noopener">minecraft.net</a> was down, only to be told by Shrogg it still works for him. I tried it on my phone and it loaded up fine. On my laptop though, I try to go to <a href="http://minecraft.net" rel="nofollow noopener">minecraft.net</a> or even login with the launcher and I get no connection at all. Anybody have an idea as to why my laptop cannot even get a connection to minecraft? I wanna say I musta got IP’d for something (what though?), but that issue seems to be bad practice for Notch, as i barely ever got on SMP.</p>
