    <title>Grand Theft Auto V!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/grand-theft-auto-v/529078</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but GTA V is all that has been on my mind these last two months! Every time I get a free second you can find me on YouTube looking for a video I have not seen yet! Unfortunately I had found the spoilers and items released &quot;accidentally&quot; by PlayStation network and was sad about one thing :/ But anyone else interested in the game? I quit playing xbox 2 years ago and sold my xbox, I know have a brand new one and have one intention for it... Grand Theft Auto V!

Do not post any spoilers or give out any information about what was in the spoilers because people may not want to know about it. Don&#39;t ruin it for them! but gladly post any information you know about the game or things you think may happen, because I am very interested!</description>
