    <description>[size=18pt][b]This is based on the movie.[/b][/size]

Alright so I can up with this idea the other day.

You start out going to a party at a bar, you have a few drinks and then the bar tinder drugs you. Then one of your friends goes missing... You must now go looking for him all around the RuneScape world! As you talk to more people you will find clues on where he is at.

I will be thinking more on this.

Please post some feed back on this : D</description>

<p>Alright so I can up with this idea the other day.</p>
<p>You start out going to a party at a bar, you have a few drinks and then the bar tinder drugs you. Then one of your friends goes missing… You must now go looking for him all around the RuneScape world! As you talk to more people you will find clues on where he is at.</p>
<p>I will be thinking more on this.</p>
<p>Please post some feed back on this : D</p>
