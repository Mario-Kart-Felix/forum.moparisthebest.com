    <title>Need Help With WinRAR [PLEASE HELP!]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-winrar-please-help/71449</link>
    <description>Hey,

     After three days of pausing and un-pausing to go on the internet myself, I FINALLY finished an 8.64GB Download of 26 language courses by Rosetta Stone, on BitLord, from Demonoid. 

The link for the torrent is here: http://www.demonoid.com/files/details/1062963/5521524/

The install notes are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;INSTALL:

Burn or mount.
Run the setup.exe file from the DVD2/APPLICATION directory.
Insert the DVD containing desired language and run the Rosetta software.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After much a much tedious waiting period, I beamed with pride as BitLord gave the notice that my download had finished. When I went to extract the .iso, it followed through, but at 100%, there was errors.

Here are the errors:

What gets me is that my hard drive is 232GB, and I have 148GB left.

Here&#39;s a picture:

As you can see, I have plenty enough room. I tried opening the .iso&#39;s in MagicISO, and all that does is just transfer the files from one place to another. I have Daemon tools and I mounted my drive, and still it won&#39;t work. PLEASE help me and don&#39;t let the sweet fruits of my labor become sour...

[center]Thanks,[/center]
