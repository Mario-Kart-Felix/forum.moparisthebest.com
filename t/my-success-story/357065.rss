    <title>My success story</title>

    <description>Well, TBH I don&#39;t know how it began...but I do know it began with being the lowest level in godwars dungeon.

Then, I guess I moved onto greater things...

I started thieving and getting more money every day and eventually I made my first 30M and got a BGS

I want to start off with my inspiration...my best friend in real life was getting rich fast, but I didn&#39;t know how, which inspired me to try different things...then I found this in an E-Mail he sent me...

Probably not the best way to put this as my life on Runescape...but I loved skilling and that got me rich...

Me catching a dragon but...look at the way my character is standing

Heres the original picture

While skilling I managed to take this screenshot.

After doing smithing I decided to train summoning, and to get my charms, I killed Giant Rock Crabs.  Heres a map to get 2 them.

[IMG]http://i369.photobucket.com/albums/oo139/wolf_scaper/Runescape%202/rc1.png[/img]

After watching my friend do a clue scroll, she showed me her 3rd age and after that my trade limit got messed up

Adventures continued, and I gained more money and joined a clan...just a few of us standing around...Photoshop butchered the pic a bit...okay a lot...

[IMG]http://i369.photobucket.com/albums/oo139/wolf_scaper/Runescape%202/banner.png[/img]


Which brings me to my final picture...the picture I quit runescape on...This picture was taken during a pk trip, and as I rushed a pker, my clan bsed me and my bank went bye bye...

So yes, I&#39;ve been places, lost stuff, and even got bsed...Runescape is like that...but you just gotta roll on</description>
