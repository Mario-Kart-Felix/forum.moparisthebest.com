    <description>Hey guys I was planning on putting my server online for players but I must know how to block, (or even hide would be okay), all the files in 
the client. I&#39;ve played many servers and everytime i&#39;ve downloaded theirs, it&#39;s like the only thing you see once you open the client is a
 Run.bat. If you guys have absolutly any link to this tutorial or any easy explanation, just give me it. Thanks  ;D ;D</description>

              <p>All you have to do is compile your client. Make sure it runs fine. Then delete every .java file. Simple as that. It will still work, and they can’t change your clients details.</p>
