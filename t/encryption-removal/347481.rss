    <description>Hi, my char files are encrypted and I need to know how to unencrypt them.  Is there anyway to do that?
Thanks,

              <p>I was reading a book about hashes and one way algorithms, (skimming through it though) and from what I read, it said that when a password is hashed using a one way algorithm, there is no way to decrypt it like that. (Hence <span class="bbcode-i">one-way</span>) The way they use the hashes is that when a user types the password into the login box, it encrypts the password that they sent, and checks it against the encrypted password in the database. If the encrypted passwords match, they are logged in.</p>

I’ve never found the MD5 hash useful, but than again, I don’t do anything that would need encryption to begin with.<br>
Anyway, that website doesn’t decrypt the hash, it just checks its database to see if someones submitted the unencrypted hash. They take random words and numbers and combine them, put them into their database, and encrypt it. When someone enters a hash that matches a hash in their database, it returns the string that they entered before encryption(Or something like that)<br>
It’s just not possible to decrypt the MD5 hash. I’m not trying to fight with you or anything, but its the truth. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p><span class="mention">@TOPIC</span> - The method most servers use, to get the string, is passHash. To find the method, just search for:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public string passHash</code></pre>
<p>Should be in client.java somewhere. There are 2 ways of getting rid of it.<br>
[ul][li]Just comment out everything except the very last return.[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Or</span>, find where it is being called in client.java, and remove it from that. Both are fairly simple methods.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">NOTE:</span> Players will not be able to login since their saved password is encrypted. I suggest making an email for them to email you at to get their password reset.</p>
