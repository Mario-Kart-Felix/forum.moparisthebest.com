    <description>Ok guys, I&#39;ve looked at other people&#39;s TuT&#39;s. I&#39;ve did what they said. I added the skillcape hood Id&#39;s to Hats, FullMasks, and FullHelm. They still won&#39;t work. IDK WHY! These are the codes I used for the Hoods. I added the codes to both Item.java and Item4.java
