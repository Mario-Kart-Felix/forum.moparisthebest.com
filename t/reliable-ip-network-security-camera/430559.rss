    <title>Reliable IP, Network Security Camera</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reliable-ip-network-security-camera/430559</link>
    <description>Recently I just got done installing a CAT 6 home network because my dad works at a cable engineering/manufacturing company where he can get expensive cable for free from prototype runs that would be otherwise recycled or trashed. Basically I had an idea of installing 2-3 outdoor network ip cameras &quot;for the hell of it&quot; but when I started to think about it, it would be cool to have and would allow me to keep an eye on the house while I am away and the ir/motion tracking can keep an eye at night. Would also allow me to not get up off my lazy ass when the door bell rings when I am down stairs on the other side of the house.

Problem is finding a decent quality network ip camera for a not so expensive price. I have finally come across a decent camera on amazon with no ratings although they seem to be better quality than the lower resolution ones that have 4/5 star reviews.

Here is a link to it on ebay: http://www.ebay.com/itm/1-Megapixel-Network-IP-Camera-HD-1280x720-1-4-Bullet-LED-POE-1-0-MP-Security-USA-/140685928437?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item20c188e7f5#ht_2579wt_1139

Here is some youtube fotage from this model: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9q2k2DAKBw

The camera touts 1280x720p hd which is nice for this price range, so question is what do you guys think?</description>

That does look better than most of the ones I have found, but the only reason I haven’t bought one yet is the working temperature is never quite right, take that one for example:</p>
<p>Working temperature 	-10 ~ +55 C which works out to 14 ~ 131 F</p>
<p>And during the winter here it regularly stays below 14F, sometimes for weeks at a time.  Though I personally can’t remember it getting above 125F or so, so I’d be fine on the max side of it.</p>
<p>Would that be a problem where you live?  If you get this one or another one, please let me know how it works out for you. :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Working temperature is also a problem for me, I assumed -10C would translate into a negative temperature in F but I guess I was wrong. I live in Omaha, NE so the temperatures regularly reach low temperature’s in the winter. I will probably go out on a limb and purchase one anyway and If I am having problems withing 30 days because of the cold I can send it back. I cant see the temperature causing two much of a problem, but I guess only time will tell.</p>
