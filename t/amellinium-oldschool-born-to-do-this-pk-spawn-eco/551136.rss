Amellinium Oldschool, in short, is mainly directed towards [B]player killing[/B] with considerable emphasis on minigames and player versus monsters. It is a spawn server with the economy - every item has it&#39;s price, but the common items are cheap so you always will have a gear to use at wilderness.

Since Amellinium is mainly directed towards player killing, You may not like to spend time on skilling. It is common for pk servers to let you set your combat levels - and this is not a bad idea as we want to spend our time enjoying wilderness. But it may be monotonic and not challenging - isn&#39;t it boring when you see around you only 126 levels? Yes it is. That&#39;s why the rank system have been included. Basically, for any rank, you have the maximum combat level assigned. Don&#39;t worry about finding your opponent - there always will be someone to fight with.

[CENTER][B][B][SIZE=5][COLOR=blue]Rank System[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][/B][/CENTER]
Ranks are made not only to show who&#39;s more involved into game, but they&#39;re also bring diversity amoung players. As said before, the higher rank the better combat you are able to have. Ranks are calculated by using elo-rating system which is a very fair way to do this.


[CENTER][B][B][SIZE=5][COLOR=blue]Economy[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][/B][/CENTER]
&quot;our economy is great join us!!!11!&quot; - that&#39;s the statement of most fresh servers. First of all, I cannot tell you where our economy stands within the first day of start, but I may let you know how it is designed to be and how it works.
First of all you earn coins by killing other players which is the main way money comes into circulation. You may also kill some of the bosses and play minigames but that&#39;s another subject. 


[CENTER][B][B][SIZE=5][COLOR=blue]Minigames &amp; Bosses[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][/B][/CENTER]
Yes, we have them and more are coming in the meantime. At this time, you may enjoy minigames such as PVP Tournament Area, Warriors Guild and  Fight caves - you probably know them.


[CENTER][B][B][SIZE=5][COLOR=blue]PVP Tournament System[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][/B][/CENTER]
Many of the other servers may organise PVP Tournaments - do you like them? You may or not, it depends on you :) But if you do, there is a PvP Tournament System which  lets you participate in any tournament at any time. 


[CENTER][B][B][SIZE=5][COLOR=blue]Deeper is better![/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][/B][/CENTER]
When you kill somebody, you will gain an extra coins reward. When you&#39;re at deeper wilderness level, you may get an extra reward. When your opponent has higher rank than you, you will even get more and when you are at multi-combat area - you will get more. 


[CENTER][B][B][SIZE=5][COLOR=blue]OSRS Content[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][/B][/CENTER]
We may have some of them, but this topic is to be discussed because many of OSRS&#39;s items are too much like cheap rsps customs.


[CENTER][B][B][SIZE=5][COLOR=blue]Server&#39;s Core[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B][/B][/CENTER]
Server&#39;s [B]core[/B] is mostly based on Asteria(thanks to lare96!)
