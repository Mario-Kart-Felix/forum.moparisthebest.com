    <title>A Few Algebra Story Problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-algebra-story-problems/21206</link>
    <description>Ok, I got a worksheet with some story problems on it, all dealing with solving equations. I got most of them, but there&#39;s 3 I can&#39;t get.

If you do want to help me out, please post how you did it, so that I actually understand the process. ( I use a 4 step method: Assign a variable, Write an equation, solve it, answer the question. So if you could do it in that format, it would help a lot, but if not, thats ok ).

[hr]

1. I have 40 coins. They consist of dimes, nickels, and quarters. They are worth $4.05. I have 7 more nickels than dimes. How many quarters are there?


2. At 1:30 pm, George left Exeter for Portsmouth, cycling at 20Km/hr. At 2:00 pm, Luke left Portsmouth for Exeter cycling at 24Km/hr. If it is 32Km between the two towns, who traveled the farthest and how much farther by the time they met?


3. Kelly rode her bike from home to the repair shop and then walked home. It took her 10 minutes to get there and 20 minutes to get back home. Her walking speed is 12km/hr lower than her riding speed. How far is the distance between her home and the repair shop?

[hr]

Thanks in advance to anyone that helps, and by the way, this is do tomorrow ( It was assigned today. ).

              <p>As the first one’s the only one in question, i’ll give you an idea of how to solve it.  First you start with 2 simple equations, with N referring to # of nickels, D to the # of dimes, Q to the number of quarters.</p>
<p>5N + 10D + 25Q = 405<br>
N + D + Q = 40</p>
<p>Substitute N for D + 7 in both:</p>
<p>5(D + 7) + 10D + 25Q = 405<br>
15D + 25Q = 370<br>
3D + 5Q = 74</p>
<p>(D + 7) + D + Q = 40<br>
2D + Q = 33</p>
<p>Solve second equation for Q since its easier and substitute:<br>
Q = 33 - 2D</p>
<p>3D + 5(33 - 2D) = 74<br>
7D = 91<br>
D = 13</p>
<p>From there you can solve for number of nickels and quarters <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
