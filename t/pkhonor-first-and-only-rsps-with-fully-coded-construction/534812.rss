[B]Why PkHonor?[/B]
-&gt; First and only RSPS with fully coded construction, just like RuneScape (with even more features)
-&gt; Working Grand Exchange
-&gt; Godwars Dungeon with all 5 bosses including Nex
-&gt; Full hunter skill with 49 different creatures to catch
-&gt; Bank tabs and bank search function, as well as up to 800 available bank spots
-&gt; Clanchats with lootshare and clan ranks
-&gt; Perfect equipment switching, great for hybrids
-&gt; Extra oldschool wilderness (aside from the normal wilderness) for those who prefer oldschool pking (only &#39;06 items, prayers and spells)
-&gt; Community-oriented: you tell us what you&#39;d like to see added or changed in our game, and we&#39;ll make it happen!
[B]
And of course:[/B]
-&gt; Stable, completely lag-free and DDoS-protected dedicated server
-&gt; Over 4 years of history, with constant changes and improvements
-&gt; Helpful staff
-&gt; Every single skill worked out
-&gt; All minigames (duel arena, barrows, fight caves, fight pits, pest control, etc.)
-&gt; Custom minigames of our own: clan wars, zombie minigame, &#39;risky&#39; barrows
-&gt; Lots of bosses to kill (Nomad, Nex, Corporeal Beast, GWD bosses, Bork, KBD, KQ, Frost Dragons, Tormented demons, Ice strykewyrms, WildyWyrm etc.)
-&gt; Chaotic, Vesta, Statius, Zuriel, Statius and Morrigan equipment
-&gt; Auto-updating client (you only have to download it once)
-&gt; ::settings command that gives you the ability to customize the looks of your client (hitmarks, hitpoints bar, animations, whip look, shortcuts etc.)
-&gt; No economy resets, EVER! In 4 years we have never had to do one, and we will never do one either. Daily backups guarantee the safety of our server and player data.

Also Slayer points, lottery, highscores, dwarf multicannon, ancient curses, skillcape emotes, Korasi’s sword, godswords, dragon claws, all defenders, hand cannon, etc. etc.

<p>My little brother and his girlfriend got bored of WoW or some other gay shit game and googled for an RSPS, found this.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I don’t agree with their economy or their donation system or really the way the server was run but it is pretty fun and still has a lot of potential. I reckon if someone could rework the whole way the server was run it would grow on a scale of SS.</p>
<p>It’s kept me going today anyway, give it a try.</p>
