    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-525-a-magical-force-stops-you-from-teleporting/388708</link>
    <description>i&#39;ve been coding my server for a little over a week now, ive added many things from its blank base i started with. i&#39;ve added safe zones ( i think i have added correctly) i cannot attack players in these zones, but it does not allow me to use my ::home command, or even normal teles i just get the message &quot;A magical force stops you from teleporting&quot; and i cant understand why, could someone help me please. ive added the places for minigames, e.g jad and once beaten theres no way out, unless i teleport the players to me, which i cant be doing every second. so please could someone help. 

lol thanks for nothing -.-</description>
