    <title>Myhosting VPS problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/myhosting-vps-problems/452629</link>
    <description>Today, my partner and I finally decided it was time to release our project into BETA mode, and to ensure 100% player satisfaction, we decide to purchase a CentOS Virtual Private Server. We were astounded by the performance of the servers, however we are currently having problems with portforwarding. We know for a fact that the server is launching up properly and that is isn&#39;t causing the problem with opening the port 43594(as we tested it on another computer and successfully opened the port), so we assume there is a problem with the ports. We currently are waiting for the VPS team to check into the issue, which they said they have already opened port 43594 to accept connections. They are still currently investigating the issue.

Has anyone ever used Myhosting before with hosting RSPS? If so, are they good, or should I go ahead and take advantage of the 30-day money back guarantee?</description>

              <p>[quote=“chrisa, post:2, topic:452629”]There should be no port restriction within our CentOS VPS as long as you setup the port forwarding properly.

<p>I respect the amount of patience you have, I would have told him to fuck off and learn the basics of a Linux VPS on google first.</p>
