    <title>How would I make a loyalty point shop? [667]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-make-a-loyalty-point-shop-667/442059</link>
    <description>Hey well Ive made myself loyalty points but how would I make it so that they can be used as a currency in a shop? Because usually to make shops you do like [shopId, currency, item, quantity] but i couldn&#39;t put the currency loyalty points in there so obviously its needed to be done in like shop.java or something??

Does anybody know how to do this? tl;dr: how do you make a shop that takes a currency that is not an item</description>
