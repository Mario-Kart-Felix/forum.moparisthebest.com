    <title>PI-Officially taking out the word &quot;RuneScape&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-officially-taking-out-the-word-runescape/538130</link>
    <description>This snippet is showing you officially how to get rid of the word &quot;Runescape&quot; in your server. For example what this would do, is change and get rid of, &quot;Bank of [u]Runescape[/u]&quot;, or &quot;When you have finished playing [u]Runescape[/u], always use the button below to log out safely&quot;.  Anyways, first goto your client, then to RSInterface.java. then search for, [code]rsInterface.message = stream.readString();[/code] and then note it out by adding // in front of it(in case you want to change it back). Then [b][u]directly[/u][/b] below that, add [code]rsInterface.message = stream.readString().replaceAll(&quot;RuneScape&quot;, &quot;Your Server Name&quot;);[/code] Change &quot;Your Server Name&quot; to well, your server name... Basicly what that code is doing is on your servers interface, replace all of the words &quot;runescape&quot;, with whatever your servername is...
Hope this helped! :D</description>

<p>Its not in Galkon’s original renamed client. Unless your using some shitty loader I doubt this would be pre-programmed into it.[/quote]<br>
“Pre-programmed” because 1 line of code is so hard to add.</p>
<p>And when did Galkon last release his first client? That’s pretty far back, why you’d still be using that when he’s released better versions, let alone others have released pretty good versions of his client too, I still see a majority of clients with this in it.</p>
<p>Also, I’m using a galkons client which has this in it.</p>
