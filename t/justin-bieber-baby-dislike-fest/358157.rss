    <description>A group of people (taking about 10s of thousands) have started disliking bieber&#39;s video; they are close to a victory.

Likes: ~294,500
Dislikes: ~343,500

Video [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kffacxfA7G4]Link[/url].

Close to a victory; discuss...

Background Info:-
Spammed around by what is believed to be 4chan on rock/punk videos along with a bunch of others (I saw it on a trance video); The attack was on the most hated video ever.

<p>Any way, what you said about hating the music business. Personally, I think that if he truly cared about music he would realize that he does not rightfully belong where he is making millions of dollars. Even if the music business is so corrupt that they will take any kid and make him a pop star. If he truly cared about the music like every artist should than he should step down from where he is. However, because he makes a lot of money, naturally he is going to want to milk this for all it’s worth. It can go both ways, but regardless, he does not have the talent by any means for me personally to think he’s deserving of the spot that he’s in.</p>
<p>When it all comes down to it, it’s just a personal opinion.</p>

<p>Yes, the music business makes puppets out of artists. I mean shit, look at souljaboy. His music is straight garbage, but they can still make money out of him. I know Justin won’t back down from the music business. The reason being is because look at his bio. He grew up with his mom being single and poor. He’s not going to back down from that kind of opportunity.</p>

<p>It really sucks that it’s the music business is like that. Kids with real talent should be given the chance, not teenagers that write garbage and call it music like souljaboy. I guess things like American Idol give chances, but even that is a popularity contest when it comes down to the end.</p>

<p>At least you actually explain why you hate him, usually i just see, “justien beinber is a fegit.”</p>
<p>Which he is, but it gets annoying. With fans, you’ll have haters, especially if he could get pretty much any girl that has fallen under his retarded spell.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Zoltanman, been a long time since I’ve seen you around.</p>
<p>Any way, what you said about hating the music business. Personally, I think that if he truly cared about music he would realize that he does not rightfully belong where he is making millions of dollars. Even if the music business is so corrupt that they will take any kid and make him a pop star. If he truly cared about the music like every artist should than he should step down from where he is. However, because he makes a lot of money, naturally he is going to want to milk this for all it’s worth. It can go both ways, but regardless, he does not have the talent by any means for me personally to think he’s deserving of the spot that he’s in.</p>
<p>When it all comes down to it, it’s just a personal opinion.</p>
