<p>Oh, I’m sorry for disagreeing with someone who grew up with Justin Bieber. You don’t know the kid personally. You’re a perfect example on how media fucks with the mind. LOOK I READ ABOUT HIM ALL OVER THE INTERWEBZ WOW HE’S A FAG</p>

        <p>The reason why I dislike him is because he doesn’t really have talent. All he has is a computer generated voice in the studio. If you put him on stage he just sounds like anyone else who has the ability to sing. He’s a sell out and takes up a space in the music industry that should belong to someone who actually deserves it.</p>
<p>Plus he sounds like a flaming homosexual.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Zoltanman, been a long time since I’ve seen you around.</p>
<p>Any way, what you said about hating the music business. Personally, I think that if he truly cared about music he would realize that he does not rightfully belong where he is making millions of dollars. Even if the music business is so corrupt that they will take any kid and make him a pop star. If he truly cared about the music like every artist should than he should step down from where he is. However, because he makes a lot of money, naturally he is going to want to milk this for all it’s worth. It can go both ways, but regardless, he does not have the talent by any means for me personally to think he’s deserving of the spot that he’s in.</p>
<p>When it all comes down to it, it’s just a personal opinion.</p>

<p>At least you actually explain why you hate him, usually i just see, “justien beinber is a fegit.”</p>
<p>Which he is, but it gets annoying. With fans, you’ll have haters, especially if he could get pretty much any girl that has fallen under his retarded spell.</p>

<p>Yes, the music business makes puppets out of artists. I mean shit, look at souljaboy. His music is straight garbage, but they can still make money out of him. I know Justin won’t back down from the music business. The reason being is because look at his bio. He grew up with his mom being single and poor.

Well no, but he can’t have been half bad to have 3 record producers chasing after him <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/expressionlessae52.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"><br>

<p>I have seen them. After studying music theory for 8+ years (still taking it in college BOO YA) I can tell talent from just a lucky kid who posted videos and is now famous, but I can totally see where you’re coming from.</p>

<p>The reason why I dislike him is because he doesn’t really have talent. All he has is a computer generated voice in the studio. If you put him on stage he just sounds like anyone else who has the ability to sing. He’s a sell out and takes up a space in the music industry that should belong to someone who actually deserves it.</p>
<p>Plus he sounds like a flaming homosexual.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Zoltanman, been a long time since I’ve seen you around.</p>
<p>Any way, what you said about hating the music business. Personally, I think that if he truly cared about music he would realize that he does not rightfully belong where he is making millions of dollars. Even if the music business is so corrupt that they will take any kid and make him a pop star. If he truly cared about the music like every artist should than he should step down from where he is. However, because he makes a lot of money, naturally he is going to want to milk this for all it’s worth. It can go both ways, but regardless, he does not have the talent by any means for me personally to think he’s deserving of the spot that he’s in.</p>
<p>When it all comes down to it, it’s just a personal opinion.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, the music business makes puppets out of artists. I mean shit, look at souljaboy. His music is straight garbage, but they can still make money out of him. I know Justin won’t back down from the music business. The reason being is because look at his bio. He grew up with his mom being single and poor. He’s not going to back down from that kind of opportunity.</p>

</aside>
<p>You hit the nail on the head, which is why the music world is so corrupt.[/quote]</p>
<p>It really sucks that it’s the music business is like that. Kids with real talent should be given the chance, not teenagers that write garbage and call it music like souljaboy. I guess things like American Idol give chances, but even that is a popularity contest when it comes down to the end.</p>

        <p>Someone youtube Tyler Ward, he’s covered hundreds of songs and definitely should be hooked up with a producer, he can sing, and he plays a few instruments.</p>
