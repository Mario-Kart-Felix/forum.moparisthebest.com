    <title>Level resetting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/level-resetting/442780</link>
    <description>Recently in my lightchaser game I wanted to add a level reset feature I have come up with two different ideas of doing this. The first way which I have already implemented involves having a second array of the current game board that remains unmodified during the game play then is called to reset the playable game board. The second way which I though of after implementing the first way involves having an array of player made moves the idea is that you would just reverse the chain of moves until the player moves array was empty. However I have not implemented this yet so I won&#39;t go further in detail until I do.  The first method is good for anyone that does not wish to have an undo/redo feature.

now lets look at the code involved:
if you want to use my source to follow my tutorial directly you can view it here: https://github.com/silabsoft/LightChaser


[code]
    var lights = []; //the playable gameboard
    var lightsCopy = []; // the shadow gameboard
[/code]


building the gameboard:


[code]
 this.buildGrid = function() {
        var size = width/lightSquared; //gameboard width divided by rowLength
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; lightSquared; i++) //generate the lights
        {
            lights[i]    =   [];
            lightsCopy[i] = [];
            for (var j = 0; j &lt; lightSquared; j++){
                lights[i][j]	=	new LightChaser.Light(i,j, size);
                lightsCopy[i][j] = new LightChaser.Light(i,j, size); 
            }
        }
		
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; lightSquared; i++) //set the Neighbors the copy board does not need this feature so we did not add the neighbors to the copy.
        {
            for (var j = 0; j &lt; lightSquared; j++)
            {
                var neighbor = [];
                var t = 0;
                if((i+1) &lt; lightSquared)
                    neighbor.push(lights[i+1][j]);
                if((j+1) &lt; lightSquared)
                    neighbor.push(lights[i][j+1]);
                if((i-1) &gt;= 0)
                    neighbor.push(lights[i-1][j]);
                if((j-1) &gt;= 0)
                    neighbor.push(lights[i][j-1]);
                lights[i][j].setNeighbor(neighbor);
            }
        }	

        
    };	
[/code]


Generating the level:

[code]
  this.generateLevel = function(){
        do{
            levelId = &quot;&quot;; 
            //console.log(&quot;generating level&quot;);
            for (var i = 0; i &lt; lightSquared; i++){
                levelId += levelKey[i];
                for (var j = 0; j &lt; lightSquared; j++){
                    if(getRandomInt(0,10) &gt; 6){
                        lights[i][j].changeState(false);
                        lightsCopy[i][j].changeState(false); //copy&#39;s the states of the gameboard
                        levelId += levelKey[5+j];
                    }
                }
            }
            
        }while(!solve()); //preform until solvable by Gaussian elimination
    }
[/code]

If we need to reset the board compare the copy boards state to the playable board if the state differs change it:

[code]
    this.resetLevel = function(){
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; lightSquared; i++){
            for (var j = 0; j &lt; lightSquared; j++){
                if(lights[i][j].getState() != lightsCopy[i][j].getState()){
                    lights[i][j].changeState(false);
                }
            }
        }
        
    }
[/code]

Obviously my code in this example is only useful to my game however you should see the process of creating a clone of the playable board then resetting the playable board to the original state if needed.</description>

It’ll probably be better to just keep a copy of the initial matrix. Storing player moves means the space taken up won’t be constant.<br>
If for whatever reason you figure that you want to try the second one for fun, know that all changes to the board are essentially just toggling the state of lights in the matrix… it follows naturally that this is its own inverse, so you’d just need to replay all of their plies.<br>

<p>The undoArray is an LIFO stack, then, for implementing undo-redo functionality? That wouldn’t really matter.<br>
You can implement the same redo-undo functionality using a circular buffer over the move array with separate R/W pointers.</p>

<p>Why not just keep track of the seed for the level and regenerate it with that seed if the person wants to reset it?</p>

<p>I suppose I could do that as well as I do generate a level ID based on the level generation however not all games would have that ability.</p>
