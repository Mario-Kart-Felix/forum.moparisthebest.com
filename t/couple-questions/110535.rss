    <description>I would appreciate it if you guys could answer these questions for me XP

[s]1. How do I make a command so that it will change my stats all to 99?
Ive been using TestScape source and Im not sure how to make a command like that[/s]

2. On TestScape source, I tried leveling up with a regular character and what I didnt like about it is that it changed the number under the slash in stats but not the top, it would change the top when I logged only.
So my question for that is how do I make it change both?

3. How do I add objects without using ::setobject?

[s]4. I&#39;m not sure if its because I&#39;m owner or something like that, but how do I get it to have a gold crown next to my name when I talk?[/s]

[s]5. How can I change other people&#39;s stats without them having to become an admin?[/s]

[s]6. How would I get the server to restart every couple hours or something like that? Just in case I decide to leave it on overnight and something crashes the server or something like that.[/s]

[s]7. How do I make other people owners/admins/mods?
And yes I DID read about going into the &quot;characters&quot; folder and changing &quot;player-rights&quot;, but it wont work, I change it to a 1 or a 2 and I log in with it but none of the commands work.  Then I log back off of that account, log back in, look at the users file and the &quot;player-rights&quot; number has changed back to 0.[/s]

Those are the biggies for me right now =D</description>

              <p>Thanks guys, I just added the ::master command and it worked, I just have to find that guide to set max stats back to 99.</p>
<p>And I’m going to look for the other tuts that S-Unit said after I’m done testing out a client.</p>
<p>Just a couple left now</p>
