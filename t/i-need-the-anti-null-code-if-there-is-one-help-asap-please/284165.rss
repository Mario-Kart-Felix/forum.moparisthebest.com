    <title>I need the Anti Null code if there is one Help ASAP PLEASE</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-the-anti-null-code-if-there-is-one-help-asap-please/284165</link>
    <description>Well my server like many others, has gotten very popular.
As this popurlarity comes to hand, alot of other people come to the server.
Which means more trouble, more bad stuff, more spammers.
So i have a SYI blocker. 
Avery useful file that helps me alot a ton now and days.
But with this blocker it makes every spammer a null, which isn&#39;t more better then a spammer.
So now i get to my question, does anyone know the code or program for it and how do i use.
Please Reply ASAP
