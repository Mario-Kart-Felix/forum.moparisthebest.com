    <title>Password System?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/password-system/444306</link>
    <description>So yesterday me and my friend as a joke were looking through runescape&#39;s job application section and we came across developer. As crappy RS coders we applied thinking we would be immediately denied but to our suprise they sent us an email with a form. The form included some work and I thought of this:
A password system in which it automatically checks host/ip/computer or even better yet fingerprint/eye scanner for us with the advanced computer accessories :p 
Just an idea but i thought of implementing it into an rsps which would be SUPER cool.
Thoughts/ideas?</description>

              <p>You should require the users to write a 1000 words essay to identify themselves. You submit a handwritten text in the login screen and a Jagex employee will read it and then evaluate how likely that you wrote it (Based on style, content and handwriting). If it is accepted you will gain access.</p>
<p>As a bonus you would reduce boting, as few would be able to write consistent enough to get access on several users at the same time.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Demolitionx711, post:1, topic:444306”]So yesterday me and my friend as a joke were looking through runescape’s job application section and we came across developer. As crappy RS coders we applied thinking we would be immediately denied but to our suprise they sent us an email with a form. The form included some work and I thought of this:<br>
A password system in which it automatically checks host/ip/computer or even better yet fingerprint/eye scanner for us with the advanced computer accessories <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Just an idea but i thought of implementing it into an rsps which would be SUPER cool.<br>
Thoughts/ideas?[/quote]<br>
Hmmm, you applied on the jagex website right?</p>

              <p>Just an idea, it would be cool for bank accounts such as paypal mentioned above and for a private server, you could even implement a voice recognition that would be very cool. I think that could be found somewhere online, it’s already implemented into several things. I will say i know several people with fingerprint scanners and microphones.</p>

              <p>+1 best idea yet on this forum. I suggest you round up your fellow RS coders and start a business plan to getting every RS player a fingerprint scanner, or even better yet contact PayPal and try to pitch the idea to them. Surely they would jump on board with this! Good luck.</p>
