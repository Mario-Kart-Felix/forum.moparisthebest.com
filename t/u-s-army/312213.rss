<p>The thing is, in Australia guns aren’t completely banned. In fact, it’s only if you request a license for the purpose of self-defense or other purposes deemed as illegitimate that you’re not allowed to own one. Even when it comes to self-defense there are some exceptions(according to wikipedia).</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia:</p>
<p>‘For each firearm a “Genuine Reason” must be given, relating to pest control, hunting, target shooting, or collecting. Self-defense is not accepted as a reason for issuing a licence, though it may be legal under certain circumstances to use a legally-held firearm for self-defence.’</p>
<p>To me this seems pretty reasonable.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure under what ‘circumstances’ possessing a firearm for self defense is allowed, but I personally don’t think your regular Joe needs a firearm to be safe. I personally only ever lived in Melbourne and as far as I’m concerned, firearms are completely unnecessary when it comes to self-defense. Moreover, I would be very concerned to see the people I lived around have access to them.</p>
<p>But my opinion is only limited to my experiences within Melbourne. I can imagine that if your occupation involves traveling in the outback i.e you’re a truck driver, a firearm is probably necessary for the purpose of self-defense. So there are obviously certain circumstances where a firearm can be necessary.</p>
<p>As far as I’m concerned, having to justify your need of a firearm is the right way to go.[/quote]<br>
I agree, owning a firearm should need a justifiable reason. I still think we should have compulsory military training. It’d give these yappos a wake up call. I’m not suggesting they be forced to go and fight, but I’m saying they should be ready fight. A country like Australia where numbers are lacking, I don’t think a strong Militia would hurt.</p>
