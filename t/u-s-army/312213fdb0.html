<p>When the second attack on the WTC Happened, Bush finally decided to treat it as a Military threat.

Before 9/11 Bush had sent spies to find out if this was the case, they returned and confirmed that it was.

Eventually Saddam was tried and hanged by the Iraqi people themselves.</p>
<p>Currently we are providing these countries security so they can build government and military infrastructures, because this is kinda hard to do when the Taliban comes in and screws everything up.</p>

<p>Wars are just one big f*ing business. Politics talking and men dying or how does the saying goes? US attacked middle-east countries only because they had some financial intrests towards them and I am not talking about oil only.</p>

<p>Maybe just a market for goods etc…</p>
<p>Our entire country practically runs on oil, and we get alot of our oil from oil fields in these countries. If Saddam was to do something to these fields it <span class="bbcode-b">would</span> send us into an economic crash and it could also have a severe impact on the entire worlds economy.</p>
<p>Of course we should stop depending on other countries for oil, which is what the Republicans want. But everytime we try to drill here Liberals and Democrats complain and file lawsuits against the companies. This is what has led the world to believing that we are “trying to use the rest of the worlds oil so we have ours last”.</p>

<p>Currently we are providing these countries security so they can build government and military infrastructures, because this is kinda hard to do when the Taliban comes in and screws everything up.[/quote]</p>
<p>The Iraqi government actually allowed UN inspectors in Iraq and the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) found no evidence of WMD.</p>
<p>The attacks you mentioned were all attacks which alqaeda is said to have claimed responsibility for. Alqaeda, however, shouldn’t be confused to be associated with the Taliban. The Taliban is a group of people that took power in Afghanistan after a civil war. Alqaeda is an organization run by Osama bin laden, the Taliban allowed Osama bin Laden to run training camps in Afghanistan. The Taliban treated Osama Bin laden as a guest in Afghanistan, nothing more.</p>
<p>After 9/11 the bush administration pointed fingers at Alqaeda. At first Osama bin laden denied involvement, a video was later found by American soldiers after the invasion in which Osama bin laden was affirming the attacks. Prior to the invasion, the Bush administration delivered demands to the Taliban:</p>
<p>[ul][li]deliver al-Qaeda leaders located in Afghanistan to the United States authorities[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[ul][li]release all imprisoned foreign nationals, including American citizens[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[ul][li]protect foreign journalists, diplomats, and aid workers in Afghanistan[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[ul][li]close terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and “hand over every terrorist and every person and their support structure to appropriate authorities”[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[ul][li]give the United States full access to terrorist training camps to verify their closure[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The Taliban responded to these demands saying that ‘there was no evidence in their possession linking bin Laden to the September 11 attacks. They also stressed that bin Laden was a guest in their country’. Later they even offered to try Bin Laden in Afghanistan in an Islamic court. The Bush administration rejected the offer and bombing began on that very same day.</p>

That only proves your ignorance. I don’t think since I joined, I’ve ever actually done anything in the swimming pool; other than the basic Naval swimming test, but even then majority of it was at the beach. Similar to the surf bronze medallion test. I’m not sure what the Royal Navy’s clearance divers do, but I know for a fact ours don’t “dive for plastic blocks underwater”.</p>

I still don’t believe it. It may be true noone cares about the armed forces in Australia; it’s not thrown around like the American military. Pardon for having pride in my military.</p>

<p>I don’t recall talking about any other forces than the American forces in the thread. And actually, “diving for treasure”, while still not a direct point, I know what you meant; is about as far off as what I am training to do. The TAG (E), last time I checked, does not dive for treasure.</p>

I know, the ADF is basically crying out for people to join. There’s a bit of discussion going around saying our basic battle fitness test requirement is too high, and there is talk of it being redesigned for 2011. Keep in mind if you invaded Australia, I’m sure our allies would help us as we’ve helped them in every conflict since it Australia was founded. However, the British are arseholes, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they wouldn’t, seeing as they’ve bailed on us before, Tobruk, etc.</p>
<p>I’m in the Navy, yes. I’m currently training to become a Clearance Diver, and specializing in Ordinance disposal and Tactical Assault. After I complete 2 years being in the reserves for training while I finish required education, I will try out of the Tactical Assault Group and begin working with the Navy SEALs in a lot of combined missions involving ordinance. After that, I hope to earn a Honorable Discharge from the Navy and start my selection for the Special Air Service Regiment.</p>

        <p>It’s no secret that this country, Australia, is fucked if we ever get invaded. We were fucked from the moment that the Howard government decided to do the gun buy back in 1996.<br>
We’re even more fucked, actually, because there’s such a negative stigma surrounding guns and the like in this country that most people don’t <em>want</em> to possess firearms.<br>
Try sitting in a high school class room and talking about guns; you’ll promptly find that the majority of people find them ‘evil’ (as if guns have an agenda of their own), just as I did a few years ago.</p>
<p>Good work on pointing out the obvious, though.</p>

<p>Problem is, we have too many wannabe gangsters in Australia to legalize guns.</p>
