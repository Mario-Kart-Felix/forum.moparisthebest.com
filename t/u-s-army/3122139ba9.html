That’s not true. In short, <span class="bbcode-u">Not <span class="bbcode-s">In</span> On My <span class="bbcode-s">Back Yard</span> Big Fucking Island</span>. I’d rather see America and its allies occupying some middle eastern country filled with oppressed muslims who need to be liberated rather than having them occupy here.<br>
And I used the word perceived in my previous post for a reason.

<p>We are the least imperialistic country of the remaining super powers… Look at what England did until around the end of WWII, all of Africa, etc. What did America ever take other then a few islands throughout multiple wars. We at least attempt to rebuild countries (even if that is not the best idea sometimes) and then give the country back to it’s new leaders.</p>

<p>European countries will help each other before they help the US. Maybe the Brits will screw us over, but big countries like Germany and France aren’t that big friends with the US. Russia will aid most Europeans just to piss on the US, and China will probably stay neutral or attack the aggressor. The Muslim world will, when they expect the US will lose, assist Europe too. And last but not least, reasonably strong South-American countries will attack the US too.</p>
<p>Besides that, once you have Nuclear weapons on Cuba, the US will be vanished. This doesn’t apply as much as it did during the Cuba-crisis, but it still enables you to use semi-long distance weapons to hit the East-coast of the US, without serious retaliation with equal weapons.</p>

<p>For the record, Australia isn’t doing too badly with regards to casualties. Even the non-combat roles receive quite reasonable combat training (~72 - 76 days IIRC) because everyone does Basic.<br>

<p>That’s not true. In short, <span class="bbcode-u">Not <span class="bbcode-s">In</span> On My <span class="bbcode-s">Back Yard</span> Big Fucking Island</span>. I’d rather see America and its allies occupying some middle eastern country filled with oppressed muslims who need to be liberated rather than having them occupy here.<br>
And I used the word perceived in my previous post for a reason. Australians have very few ‘real’ rights; most of ours, save a few in our constitution, exist through statutes and are thus revocable at any time by hostile future governments. With that said, there’s still no way that I’d want arabs occupying and changing the lifestyle in this country.<br>

<p>We are the least imperialistic country of the remaining super powers… Look at what England did until around the end of WWII, all of Africa, etc. What did America ever take other then a few islands throughout multiple wars.

<p>Yeah they’re good at making movies where you see soldiers saving people, or even the world. People think they’re heroes when they join the army, but in reality, the American government is sending your soldiers to places like Afghanistan and Iraq where they protect the most corrupt governments in the world.</p>
<p>Over 4600 Americans died on the battlefield in Iraq alone, to protect the world’s 3rd most corrupt government (according to the CIA). Not really a Saving private Ryan scenario…</p>
