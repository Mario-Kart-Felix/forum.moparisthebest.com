    <title>Making A Client .JAR</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-client-jar/195568</link>
    <description>Tut was made by Jip1207 (with creds to Killer99)

     I was looking around for one and couldn&#39;t find one. Eventually I found a post that told me to go to the webclient tut. So I went into the webclient tut made by Killer99 and borrowed some of his ideas but made it easier to read.

Here we go:

1. Download a program called JarMaker
   1a. Can be found at http://www.download.com/JAR-Maker/3000-2417_4-10588876.html
   1b. The program was made at www.goldenstudios.or.id


2. Open Up your client folder
   2a. Make sure you have made all the changes you want then compile it
   2b. Delete all .java files (DO NOT DELETE ANY .CLASS, THE CACHE, OR TEH MODELS) also delete signlink.java from the sign folder


3. Unzip JARMaker and run it
   3a. Change the output file to where you want the .jar file to go
   3b. Change application.jar to whatever you want the file&#39;s name to be (leave the .jar at teh end)
   3c. For Input Directory change it to your client folder for all the .class files (ie. C:\Desktop\Client)
   3d. Click on Manifest template and put in &quot;client&quot; (NO CAPS!)


4. Now click Create JAR!
   4a. Wait for the pop up to come telling you that everything went okay before you try to run teh .jar file
   4b. Now exit out of teh program (you can save your settings if you want)


5. Open up your client folder again
   5a. You can now delete all the .class files to make it look neater.
   5b. You can also remove the sign folder and models folder, but I would keep them somewhere safe just in case



And Your done?!?!?!
To re-extract your files I use a program called Izarc (Or Winrar)
So google it and download and install to extract


~~Thanks, Jip1207
