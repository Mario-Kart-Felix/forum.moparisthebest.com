    <title>Emotes in methods</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/emotes-in-methods/157723</link>
    <description>Ok, recently i&#39;ve been thinking how to make the emote in a method work, before anthing else does.. Example:

When you die, you do the emote, then teleport..


But it doesn&#39;t work like that does it?..

The method is read correct? That&#39;s what makes it work... Or the spell is read. It just does all the things at once..

I&#39;ve tried adding a timer n such, but still.. Doesn&#39;t work. Same with ice barrage, emote before GFX.

Does anyone know how this could be done?..[br][size=1]Posted on: November 07, 2007, 10:19:55 AM[/size][hr]Please, anyone?</description>
