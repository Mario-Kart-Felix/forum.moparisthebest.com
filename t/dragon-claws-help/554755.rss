    <description>Can someone make the d claw model for me, please i tried this and still nothing all i need is the model / int&#39;s however you wanna look at it and i can do the rest on my own.

I also can use Cases to like case 11777: ect..

[code]if(i == 11777) {
            itemDef.itemActions = new String[5];
            itemDef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Wield&quot;;
            itemDef.modelID = 44590;
            itemDef.anInt165 = 43660;//anInt165
            itemDef.anInt200 = 43660;//anInt200
            itemDef.modelZoom = 789;
            itemDef.modelRotationX = 240;
            itemDef.modelRotationY = 60;
            itemDef.modelOffset1 = -1;
            itemDef.modelOffset2 = -23;
            itemDef.name = &quot;Dragon claws&quot;;
            itemDef.description = &quot;A set of fighting claws.&quot;.getBytes();
