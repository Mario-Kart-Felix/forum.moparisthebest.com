Nepharion is an attempt to completely remake the RuneScape game in a higher performing, more graphically stunning engine known as JMonkeyEngine. Nepharion will use a combination of graphical enhancing features, for example smooth shading to make the low polygon models look smooth, and hardware tessellation to actually make them smooth.
The reasoning behind this is that JMonkeyEngine outperforms the RuneScape software renderer, even in situations where there is no available hardware acceleration resources, rendering the same 3D scene will be quicker in OpenGL.
Nepharion will also remove the tile restriction that is present in RuneScape, and thanks to a fairly powerful server, and a very low consuming physics engine, will replace the existing tile-based checks with actual collision checking. This will unlock an entirely new dimension in the world of RuneScape!

The idea is that once we have finished with the conversion, we will begin to add new systems which would previously be either impossible or impractical given the restrictions posed by RuneScape. An example of this is a variable character run speed which can be altered by prayers, or flight which could be achieved by, for example, a tamed dragon.

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/lOCULnj.png[/img]
So far, We have got a full conversion of all RuneScape 317 models in a format which is easily loadable by JMonkeyEngine, as well as one which can easily be edited. In a previous draft version, We already had entire maps loading, with object maps, object animation (and all other model animation), with HD features being reflective water, parallax and normal mapping on all textures, fog and a skybox. Animation tweening was also in this, however we will likely not be taking this over to the live version in its current form.

[I]Below are the planned features, colour coded to indicate our progress.[/I]

Excuse the lack of information, this will be updated as I cannot think of specific features at the top of my head.[/spoiler]

new wave particles with trail
[B]13/02/2014[/B]

Still working on the SDK. First off, I&#39;m making an animation editor, and a model &#39;editor&#39; (it will only act as a means of attaching particles, merging animations etc)
[img]http://puu.sh/6TLEi.png[/img]
[img]http://puu.sh/6TMmX.png[/img]

Update 23:07 12/02/14 GMT: The particle editor is now fully functional, and the update button works fully.
[img]http://puu.sh/6TOCl.png[/img]

[B]Update 23:30 12/02/14 GMT[/B]: Open / Save now works fully.

[B]23:43 GMT[/B]: All Wave (Rank 4) spells have been created in this particle editor in under a minute. Efficient or what?


Currently working on an in-house set of tools for modification of the world. It supports 5 layout modes (pretty much everything one would need). There&#39;s not much to show at the moment, besides the viewport layout:
[img]http://puu.sh/6Tpgw.png[/img]
Explanation:
The rectangle to the left with the black background is the 3D world viewport. This can be made fullscreen to fix the messed up field of vision.
The top right quad is the object preview. This will allow you to view the object in 3D before placing it in the world.
The bottom right quad is the orthographic top view. This will be used like a minimap, but more in-detail. To preserve FPS, this won&#39;t render graphical effects for example reflective water.
[B]12/02/2014

Getting started on the spells. The spells will be separated into the 4 elements, and have different ranks. This is what a maximum rank fire spell would look like:
[IMG]http://puu.sh/6ShHC.png[/img]
As you can see, It&#39;s also got a few yellow point light nodes, affecting the surrounding objects.

<p>nigga wut, lol. Theres a ton of great technology in the Runescape client (old engine and new).</p>
<p>Theres a common misconception with programming that your first product must be perfect, a lot of the time you have to write to a certain design spec and a lot of the previous conditions change hence engine changes. Their 2nd engine had a lot more streamlined features that their 1st engine had which were sort of in a rough draft state.</p>

              <p>Seen this already before on Rune-Server. It looks promising. However, that engine you’re currently using won’t give you a huge advantages. The frames per second looks fantastic to be honest. You still have a lot to do on the graphical aspect of the game. Especially textures, they aren’t fluid. This is in the development section, so I won’t criticize this. Good luck.</p>

Nepharion is an attempt to completely remake the RuneScape game in a higher performing, more graphically stunning engine known as JMonkeyEngine. Nepharion will use a combination of graphical enhancing features, for example smooth shading to make the low polygon models look smooth, and hardware tessellation to actually make them smooth.<br>
The reasoning behind this is that JMonkeyEngine outperforms the RuneScape software renderer, even in situations where there is no available hardware acceleration resources, rendering the same 3D scene will be quicker in OpenGL.<br>
Nepharion will also remove the tile restriction that is present in RuneScape, and thanks to a fairly powerful server, and a very low consuming physics engine, will replace the existing tile-based checks with actual collision checking. This will unlock an entirely new dimension in the world of RuneScape!</p>
<p>The idea is that once we have finished with the conversion, we will begin to add new systems which would previously be either impossible or impractical given the restrictions posed by RuneScape. An example of this is a variable character run speed which can be altered by prayers, or flight which could be achieved by, for example, a tamed dragon.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/lOCULnj.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
So far, We have got a full conversion of all RuneScape 317 models in a format which is easily loadable by JMonkeyEngine, as well as one which can easily be edited. In a previous draft version, We already had entire maps loading, with object maps, object animation (and all other model animation), with HD features being reflective water, parallax and normal mapping on all textures, fog and a skybox. Animation tweening was also in this, however we will likely not be taking this over to the live version in its current form.</p>

<p>Still working on the SDK. First off, I’m making an animation editor, and a model ‘editor’ (it will only act as a means of attaching particles, merging animations etc)<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/6TLEi.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/6TMmX.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Update 23:07 12/02/14 GMT: The particle editor is now fully functional, and the update button works fully.<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/6TOCl.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>[B]Update 23:30 12/02/14 GMT[/B]: Open / Save now works fully.</p>
<p>[B]23:43 GMT[/B]: All Wave (Rank 4) spells have been created in this particle editor in under a minute. Efficient or what?</p>
<p>Currently working on an in-house set of tools for modification of the world. It supports 5 layout modes (pretty much everything one would need). There’s not much to show at the moment, besides the viewport layout:<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/6Tpgw.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Explanation:<br>
The rectangle to the left with the black background is the 3D world viewport. This can be made fullscreen to fix the messed up field of vision.<br>
The top right quad is the object preview. This will allow you to view the object in 3D before placing it in the world.<br>
The bottom right quad is the orthographic top view. This will be used like a minimap, but more in-detail. To preserve FPS, this won’t render graphical effects for example reflective water.<br>
[B]12/02/2014<br>

<p>Getting started on the spells. The spells will be separated into the 4 elements, and have different ranks. This is what a maximum rank fire spell would look like:<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/6ShHC.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
As you can see, It’s also got a few yellow point light nodes, affecting the surrounding objects.<br>
