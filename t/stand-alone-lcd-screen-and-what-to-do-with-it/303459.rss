    <title>Stand alone LCD screen, and what to do with it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stand-alone-lcd-screen-and-what-to-do-with-it/303459</link>
    <description>I was bored so I decided to take my broken camera apart(It was cheap and the shutter snapped.).

I took out some components like the lens, some crystal looking thing, LCD screen, mic, a small motor, a light, the button pad, and the main chip(Or whatever it&#39;s called.).

The only thing that I didn&#39;t have to rip out was the LCD screen, it was connected to the chip and it slid out just like a card, so I was thinking since it is in perfect condition why let it go to waste. It&#39;s not damaged at all.

Is there anything I can do with this? Such as hooking it up to another component to make like.. A mini-TV or something? :D

Also I have the microphone from it which is just a plastic circle with metal in the middle, and it has two wires coming out from it.</description>

              <p>Really there’s not much you could do with it. That golden cable that comes out (Ribbon) is the IO device, I mean yeah if you could find a connector to plug it into sure, or maybe you could splice some of the ribbon apart to downsize it. Idk, if all else fails theres Google.</p>

Your camera is a tad just fuzzy<br>

Yep! 2 Megapixles.[/quote]<br>
If you manualy focused you would have no problems. MP is irrelevant to the quality of a picture.</p>
<p>That connector looks familiar, if it is the same length, you could probably hook it up to a GBA. Your ideas on making a TV are far away since I doubt many tuners output video via a connection like that.<br>
You could make a fan with the motor, You could even power it by USB using the cable that came with the camera.</p>
