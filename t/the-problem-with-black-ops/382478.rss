    <title>The problem with black ops</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-problem-with-black-ops/382478</link>
    <description>since I got the game I have said knifing is overpowered, considering you lunge 2-3 foot forward and with the tiniest bit of lag that 2-3 foot is more like 4-6ft, about the range shotguns become useless, and I wasn&#39;t surprised to find out that I have died by the knife 74 times

doesn&#39;t seem much right? I have died less times by any pistol in the game, combined with any shotgun and sniper in the game [b]doubled[/b]

for a comparison, I have died by an ak74u more than any other weapon in the game, 199 times to be exact, second was the famas with 137 deaths by, galil comes in at 3rd with 65, einfield 61 ak47 59 etc etc

tl;dr welcome to call of ak74uassaultrifleknife: black ops</description>

<p>Of course there is nothing wrong with blatantly unrealistic games like CoD and Battlefield, as long as nobody tries to claim they are aiming for realism in anything other than the graphics.</p>

</aside>
<p>my beef isn’t with playing seriously, realism(or lack of), knifes being 1 hit kill or anything else, its with the mechanics and in the case of black ops vs previous call of duty games black ops knifes are seriously broken, you can run past an enemy and by the time both you and them are back to back with a foot gap and I’m not even exaggerating here, if you knife you WILL get the kill</p>
<p>it’s an issue with lag and hitboxes I know, but previous call of duty games had exactly the same issues with lag and hitboxes with guns but knifes were USELESS, lag isn’t the only issue with knifes in call of duty(or battlefield, pls 2 watch video) either because the way the knife works it is an instant kill weapon no matter what you are doing, press button knife pops up and bam</p>
<p>but pls watch the video it is funny…</p>

<p>Can you explain to me how in real life how being stabbed with a knife pretty much anywhere above the waist wouldn’t seriously cripple or kill a person?  I understand some knife kills are bullshit, and I do agree with that, it’s just simple fact that a knife to a vulnerable point in the body will lead to death.  I’m not saying that Treyarch got anything right with Black ops, because I still do agree with TL, I myself have never been able to enjoy my time on a Call of Duty game since Cod4.  I am seriously sick of the engine being re-released with the same issues existing previously.  As Cowie said, experienced players will know what guns to use if they want to rack up kills and such, but who says all the guns available in the game are just as effective in real life?  While not all of these games shoot for realism, it is a point in development where they are phased with the question.  I don’t play Cod nearly as much as I used to, infact it’s become more of a leisure-only, play with friends type of thing.  It doesn’t interest me like it used to, I’m not motivated anymore with it.  Unless something drastic is done with the game engine and overall gameplay (which is possible, seeing as Sledgehammer is now a developer for the supposed “Modern Warfare 3”), I will more than likely be staying away from the next installment this November.</p>

              <p>The knifing in black ops had been adjusted so the lunge is a bit lower, but I notice more of the “Completely missing yet killing the person” knifing.</p>
<p>In summary: The ak74u, famas, and aug control the game. These are the top 3 guns I have died from with everything else wayyy behind. The ak74u received adjustments but it didn’t seem to make a difference.</p>
<p>I am pretty positive that I have never played a single game that did not contain one of the above weapons. Everything else is fine for me in the game, but the above is definitely what drives me away.</p>
<p>Other complaints: The camo choices suck, RC-XDs are the worst update to CoD, and sniping is extremely boring now.</p>

They haven’t made a new Call of Duty since 2007. They’ve re-skinned CoD4 over and over again. Just give up on it, it is a horribly drab and generic piece of shit, I can’t believe people still accept such sub-standard bullshit.</p>
<p>Call of Duty 4 was good. It was a bit of fresh air for console fps games, but it still wasn’t really anything new in the overall package. I think what frustrates me the most is these people who make these serious competitions out of a game that clearly wasn’t made for real competition.</p>
<p>It was made for the Wii generation. With each new release, the ability to hold decent competition that is fair, balanced and has sufficient game mechanics that require a player to learn and develop a skill at the game has diminished. If you’re having fun with it, that is fine, but don’t bring up your “skills” in a game that was purposely developed for people who don’t want to develop any.<br>

<p>Don’t get how this is so, LAN for competition gaming on CoD4 is brilliant - All people do is whine about certain weapons being over powered, and spawns being nerfed but you’ll find people either play RMG or SnD on CoD4 and players who actually have a tiny bit of sense and experience only use a selection of weapons. Notably being the M16 or AK47 for long distance, the MP5 or AK74u at short and the M40 for sniping.</p>
<p>Sure, in situations it helps to have headsets specifically designed for gaming but that can be said for a lot of games - especially when I can soundwhore any call of duty, any halo and even stuff like AC and SC.</p>

<p>Rofl I had the same problem except it didn’t take me that long before I just decided to suicide run. There was another level where you’re supposed to kill a guard before he spots you but the thing is you’re never told that you’re supposed to kill him. I died like 10 times before I looked it up online.</p>
