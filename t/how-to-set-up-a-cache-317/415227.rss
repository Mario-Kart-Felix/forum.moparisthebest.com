    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-set-up-a-cache-317/415227</link>
    <description>ok, so how do i set up my cache for a webclient. this is how my client folder is set up, i open my main folder i have 2 options, open another folder (with all the files) or click run

ok then if u go into files folder u see

added models
cache(has folder anim, animations, signframe, clan chat, spirites and anims and a couple other Files and audio files below)
           -anim folder has - what looks like more models, but not ziped, they are Dat Files
           -animations are the same thing
           -signframe has 2 folders, custom and prayer
                   -custom has a bunch of jag files and like 3 png files
                   -prayer has 2 files, prayeroff and prayeron, under that it has a couple jag and a couple png files
                            -prayeroff has a bunch of jag files
                            -prayeron has a bunch of jag files
                   -clanchat has a bunch of png files
                   -spirites (too lazy to say, ask if u need to know)
                   -anims bunch of dat files
then the other files are (in the main folder)

javazoom
manifest (empty)
