    <title>All these 317&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/all-these-317s/432238</link>
    <description>    I&#39;m coming back after a couple years&#39; break to find that people are still primarily running 317s. I remeber overhauling czar based servers and my god was it ugly. From what I&#39;ve heard this &quot;PI&quot; base is almost as bad.

     So my question is, is there a decent 562+ base out there? One that isn&#39;t a botched 317 overhaul with code in all the wrong places? Right now I&#39;m trying to progress on an element-X based server, which I believe is based off of painzones&#39; source(although I have yet to look at PZ.*shrug*), but so many functions are redundant and/or broken. It looks like it was a decent base and then some kid decided to copy-paste a bunch of shitty content into it.

Thanks for your responses in advance,
