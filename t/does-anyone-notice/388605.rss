              <p>I remember obsidian shields being 200k and capes being 300k. Best days ever, but then that tokkul update happened and killed it. Obsidian capes used to be somewhat of a sign of luck and money, now everyone and their brother has one. Fire capes are the only things that really show some status anymore &lt;&lt;</p>

Me: Oh?
Kid: Yeah, I used to have 100M, but lost 60M pking
Me: Who would PK after losing that much?
Kid: Idk I just did.

Kid: Wow u stalker I got it from a clue.
Me: Stalker? I was just curious.
Kid: Yeah your a stalker
