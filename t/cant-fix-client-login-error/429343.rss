    <title>Can&#39;t fix client login error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-fix-client-login-error/429343</link>
    <description>There is a problem with model/ item;location;npc  i added  public npc;item;location(){} etc to quiet the compiler
when a user creates their account plays it etc and they log out that is fine. Then when they log back in using the unmodded client it said &quot;error loading your profile please contact customer service&quot;

and maybe help me fix this.
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.mina.filter.executor.ExecutorFilter).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.


Anyone who solves this problem will have the right to call themselves a coding master
