    <description>I am using the Deltascape source, and I found in the internet somewhere a tutorial on making it so when pking, you follow the player as they run away. Well I am having some issues with this, 1 is where when you kill the player you run towards them (They are spawned in lumbridge)
2: If they run away, and you are using range\Mage you get disconnection.
Now Can someone please help me, either delete what i put in there, or help me find a fix.
Thanks,
