              <p>Thsi is the first time shes eevr bit somebody. Ok here’s how it happened, the postman knocked on my door, and then stood behind my fence, I opened the back door to walk out to the fence - it’s only a small one. The dog then came running out and charged threw the gate and jumped up at the postman - it’s a Jack Russel btw. The postman claims the dog bit him but from what I saw the dog didn’t even put it’s mouth near him.<br>
The gate was closed by the way, I dunno how the dog managed to charge it open.</p>
