    <title>I need a stable downloadable silab client with IP entery</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-stable-downloadable-silab-client-with-ip-entery/298214</link>
    <description>Alright, so this is my problem.
I got my self a server running 24/7 but i can not connect to it propperly, myself.
The problem is that i dont have a client, i tend to use silabsoft.org and moparisthebest.com but those are really instable(atleast they are for me)

So now i have been trying like 25 clients i found on here but i cant seem to be able to adjust them to my IP, so now im looking for a client like moparisthebest.com one that you need to fill in the IP and/or Port (but port is default one so.)

Can anyone help me how i can make this or were i can find a client such as this?


Thanks allot,
