    <description>Hey, I started my server a little while ago and im having EXTREME trouble gaining a community. now at one point i had lots of people coming in and out trying out thing, and actually had a few active players :P. Yet now there is no1. I have one coder i managed to find who live&#39;s in africa and cant get on server so he just helps on forums. There a bunch of things I want to get accomplished. I want to come out with a v3 of my client, I want it working for all computer types, and a little more custom. So if anyone can help me out with that post.

2: My friend and I are working extremly hard to get money for a VPS. a beilve having that will help a ton with the community.
The problem there is, I havent had anyone stay on the server long enough to really like it, and donate even a little.

3: i would LOVE to have a web client. I found a couple of ASP hosting sites that would do it, but i dont know how to set it up on the site, or how to work any of the controls on the ASP hosting sites.

So i have a question. Should I try something ENTIRLY new with the server? diffrent source new beggining?

I appreciate any responses!</description>
