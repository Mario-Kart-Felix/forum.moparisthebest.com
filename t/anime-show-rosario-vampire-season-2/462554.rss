    <title>[Anime show] Rosario vampire season 2</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anime-show-rosario-vampire-season-2/462554</link>
    <description>Hey,
I need a lil bit of help &gt;&lt;. Started watching the anime tv show and I effing love it (even though its sooo retarded at times haha) and I can&#39;t seem to find where to watch the second season (they had released the second season).
Anyone know where I could watch it/point me in the right direction? Been searching and a lot of its been removed for some reason &lt;/3.
It&#39;d need to be english subbed though &gt;&lt;.</description>

<p>I’m so sad, watched the last episode of rosario + vampire, never realised I liked it that much XD. Worst thing when a show you like is finished &lt;/3.</p>

You’ll probably like this ecchi then:P.<br>
Yeah they will be making a second season cause the first one was really popular;o and they said so themselves &gt;&lt;.<br>

<p>[quote=“LilXCj, post:8, topic:462554”]HOTD was aimed to be ecchi because the author is a hentai writer. There won’t be a second season unless the author decides to write a second volume to HOTD.</p>

<p>Also, use <a href="http://animeultima.tv" rel="nofollow noopener">animeultima.tv</a>.
