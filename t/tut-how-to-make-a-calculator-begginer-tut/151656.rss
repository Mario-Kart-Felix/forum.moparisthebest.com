    <title>{TUT} How to make a Calculator. [Begginer]{TUT}</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-how-to-make-a-calculator-begginer-tut/151656</link>
    <description>Hi i recently made a tut called  &quot;how to make a powerminer&quot; but the problem was it baarely got any veiws so i noticed that many people on this forum may not play rs2 so im making a tut on &quot;How to make a Calculator&quot;. 
This tut is for begginers.

[size=10pt][b]##########Chapter 1##########[/b][/size]

First you must open up Scar you should see this.
[code]
Program New;
Begin
End.[/code]

Start by spacing it out a little  then below [code]Program New;[/code] add this [code]Const[/code] A const is something that you tell the script to remember so instead of saying the same color or number 50+ times you could name it I in the const or X or anything else and the Script would remember it. So below [code]Const[/code] Type

[code]Number1=;//Write your first number here
Number2=;//Write your second number here[/code]
See how i have [code]//[/code] before [code]Write your first number here[/code] and the same with the second ? I do that because its like a note to the person reading the script or other scripters you could also have[code] {Write your first number here}[/code]Now we have to tell the user to choose what they are doing so if they want to choose multiply they would have to put a * in between the const we are going to add. Type [code]TheSum = &#39;&#39;;//For addition put + for subtraction put - for multiplication put * and for division put /[/code] now the user knows what to do, add this below Number2

[size=10pt][b]##########Chapter 2##########[/b][/size]

Your script should now look something like this:
[code]program New;
Const
Number1= ;//Write your first number here
Number2= ;//Write your second number here
TheSum = &#39;&#39; ;//For addition put + for subtraction put - for multiplication put * and for division put /
begin



end.[/code]
Now the script remembers Number1, Number2 and TheSum but it does nothing with them so before begin we are going to add a &quot;procedure&quot; Which basicly tells SCAR what to do. Write [code]Procedure Answer;[/code]
i have named my procedure &quot;Answer&quot; but you can call it anything you want. Below [code]Procedure Answer;[/code] we will tell the script that its the begining of the procedure by adding in [code]Begin[/code]


Now we are going to tell the script that [b]if[/b] the user selects + [b]then[/b] add them together and give the user the answer in the debug box..... to do that we must write

[code]If TheSum = &#39;+&#39; then
begin
Writeln(&#39;Your Answer is : &#39; + IntToStr (Number1 + Number2);
end;[/code]
Writeln is a command that writes something in the debug box of scar.See how end has a semicolon thats because its the end of that bart not of the script. Now we are going to do the same thing exept not another procedure we can just write this after [code]end;[/code] write 
[code]If TheSum = &#39;-&#39; then 
begin
Writeln(&#39;Your Answer is : &#39; + IntToStr (Number1 - Number2)[/code]do the same for multiplication and division only changing the + ,-, /  and *.once you have done that the script should look something like this:[code]program New;
Const
Number1= 25;//Write your first number here
Number2= 25;//Write your second number here
TheSum = &#39;+&#39; ;//For addition put + for subtraction put - for multiplication put * and for division put /
procedure Answer;
begin
if TheSum = &#39;+&#39; then
begin
Writeln(&#39;Your Answer is : &#39; + IntToStr(Number1 + Number2));
end;
if TheSum = &#39;-&#39; then
begin
Writeln(&#39;Your Answer is : &#39; + IntToStr(Number1 - Number2));
end;
if TheSum = &#39;/&#39; then
begin
Writeln(&#39;Your Answer is : &#39; + IntToStr(Number1 / Number2));
end;
if TheSum = &#39;*&#39; then
begin
Writeln(&#39;Your Answer is : &#39; + IntToStr(Number1 * Number2));
end;
end;
begin



end.[/code]

[size=10pt][b]##########Chapter 3##########[/b][/size]
You are now very close to finishing your calculator all you need to do is add something called the [b][i]Main Loop[/i][/b] the main loop is what scar follows so you have to add your procedure in there for scar to do it. In Between [code]begin



end.[/code]
type the following
[code]
ClearDebug;
Answer;[/code]

ClearDebug; clears the dubug box of scar.

And Answer; is the name of my procedure finnaly your script should look like this:
[code]program New;
Const
Number1= 25;//Write your first number here
Number2= 25;//Write your second number here
TheSum = &#39;+&#39; ;//For addition put + for subtraction put - for multiplication put * and for division put /
procedure Answer;
begin
if TheSum = &#39;+&#39; then
begin
Writeln(&#39;Your Answer is : &#39; + IntToStr(Number1 + Number2));
end;
if TheSum = &#39;-&#39; then
begin
Writeln(&#39;Your Answer is : &#39; + IntToStr(Number1 - Number2));
end;
if TheSum = &#39;/&#39; then
begin
Writeln(&#39;Your Answer is : &#39; + IntToStr(Number1 / Number2));
end;
if TheSum = &#39;*&#39; then
begin
Writeln(&#39;Your Answer is : &#39; + IntToStr(Number1 * Number2));
end;
end;
begin
ClearDebug;
Answer;
end.[/code]

I hope you liked this tut and that it helped you learn a bit more about scar
I may make another tut which will be a bit harder so look out for it.</description>

In my opinion no because not many people would need calculators for SCAR, it would be better if you just had forms.<br>
[/quote]<br>
A)- even if you dont need a calculator you could learn something off this.<br>
B)- if you looked at the title it has begginer!!<br>
C)- if you looked at my previous post you would notice that i am making another one that will have forms<br>
D)- how have i been doing “this” lately<br>
E)- i wasnt asking for your opinion i was asking for freddys!</p>
<p>[quote author=script_owned4 link=topic=207434.msg1824675#msg1824675 date=1192504078]<br>

[/quote][/quote]<br>
A)There is something like this<br>
B)I don’t think you’ll make another one<br>
C)you never said that freddy advised that but you didn’t say a thing<br>
D)look in your auto-miner isn’t that lately all it has been changed was to an auto-miner<br>

              <p>Hi i recently made a tut called  “how to make a powerminer” but the problem was it baarely got any veiws so i noticed that many people on this forum may not play rs2 so im making a tut on “How to make a Calculator”.<br>
This tut is for begginers.</p>
<p>[size=10pt]<span class="bbcode-b">#########<span class="hashtag">#Chapter</span> 1##########</span>[/size]</p>
<p>First you must open up Scar you should see this.</p>
<p><code>
Program New;
Begin
End.</code></p>
<p>Start by spacing it out a little  then below <code>Program New;</code> add this <code>Const</code> A const is something that you tell the script to remember so instead of saying the same color or number 50+ times you could name it I in the const or X or anything else and the Script would remember it. So below <code>Const</code> Type</p>
<p><code>Number1=;//Write your first number here
Number2=;//Write your second number here</code><br>
See how i have <code>//</code> before <code>Write your first number here</code> and the same with the second ? I do that because its like a note to the person reading the script or other scripters you could also have<code> {Write your first number here}</code>Now we have to tell the user to choose what they are doing so if they want to choose multiply they would have to put a * in between the const we are going to add. Type <code>TheSum = '';//For addition put + for subtraction put - for multiplication put * and for division put /</code> now the user knows what to do, add this below Number2</p>
<p>[size=10pt]<span class="bbcode-b">#########<span class="hashtag">#Chapter</span> 2##########</span>[/size]</p>
<p>Your script should now look something like this:</p>
<p>[code]program New;<br>
Const<br>
Number1= ;//Write your first number here<br>
Number2= ;//Write your second number here<br>
TheSum = ‘’ ;//For addition put + for subtraction put - for multiplication put * and for division put /<br>
begin</p>
<p>end.[/code]<br>
Now the script remembers Number1, Number2 and TheSum but it does nothing with them so before begin we are going to add a “procedure” Which basicly tells SCAR what to do. Write <code>Procedure Answer;</code><br>
i have named my procedure “Answer” but you can call it anything you want. Below <code>Procedure Answer;</code> we will tell the script that its the begining of the procedure by adding in <code>Begin</code></p>
<p>Now we are going to tell the script that <span class="bbcode-b">if</span> the user selects + <span class="bbcode-b">then</span> add them together and give the user the answer in the debug box… to do that we must write</p>
<p><code>If TheSum = '+' then
begin
Writeln('Your Answer is : ' + IntToStr (Number1 + Number2);
end;</code><br>
Writeln is a command that writes something in the debug box of scar.See how end has a semicolon thats because its the end of that bart not of the script. Now we are going to do the same thing exept not another procedure we can just write this after <code>end;</code> write</p>
<p><code>If TheSum = '-' then 
begin
Writeln('Your Answer is : ' + IntToStr (Number1 - Number2)</code>do the same for multiplication and division only changing the + ,-, /  and <em>.once you have done that the script should look something like this:[code]program New;<br>
Const<br>
Number1= 25;//Write your first number here<br>
Number2= 25;//Write your second number here<br>
TheSum = ‘+’ ;//For addition put + for subtraction put - for multiplication put * and for division put /<br>
procedure Answer;<br>
begin<br>
if TheSum = ‘+’ then<br>
begin<br>
Writeln('Your Answer is : ’ + IntToStr(Number1 + Number2));<br>
end;<br>
if TheSum = ‘-’ then<br>
begin<br>
Writeln('Your Answer is : ’ + IntToStr(Number1 - Number2));<br>
end;<br>
if TheSum = ‘/’ then<br>
begin<br>
Writeln('Your Answer is : ’ + IntToStr(Number1 / Number2));<br>
end;<br>
if TheSum = '</em>’ then<br>
begin<br>
Writeln('Your Answer is : ’ + IntToStr(Number1 * Number2));<br>
end;<br>
end;<br>
begin</p>
<p>end.[/code]</p>
<p>[size=10pt]<span class="bbcode-b">#########<span class="hashtag">#Chapter</span> 3##########</span>[/size]<br>
You are now very close to finishing your calculator all you need to do is add something called the <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Main Loop</span></span> the main loop is what scar follows so you have to add your procedure in there for scar to do it. In Between [code]begin</p>
<p>end.[/code]<br>
type the following</p>
<p><code>
ClearDebug;
Answer;</code></p>
<p>ClearDebug; clears the dubug box of scar.</p>
<p>And Answer; is the name of my procedure finnaly your script should look like this:</p>
<p><code>program New;
Const
Number1= 25;//Write your first number here
Number2= 25;//Write your second number here
TheSum = '+' ;//For addition put + for subtraction put - for multiplication put * and for division put /
procedure Answer;
begin
if TheSum = '+' then
begin
Writeln('Your Answer is : ' + IntToStr(Number1 + Number2));
end;
if TheSum = '-' then
begin
Writeln('Your Answer is : ' + IntToStr(Number1 - Number2));
end;
if TheSum = '/' then
begin
Writeln('Your Answer is : ' + IntToStr(Number1 / Number2));
end;
if TheSum = '*' then
begin
Writeln('Your Answer is : ' + IntToStr(Number1 * Number2));
end;
end;
begin
ClearDebug;
Answer;
end.</code></p>
<p>I hope you liked this tut and that it helped you learn a bit more about scar<br>
I may make another tut which will be a bit harder so look out for it.</p>
