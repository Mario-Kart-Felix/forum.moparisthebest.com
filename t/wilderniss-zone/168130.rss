              <p>[quote=“hamza185, post:5, topic:168130”]Description<br>
In this tutorial, you will learn how to make something a danger zone or a safe zone by editing the ‘public void checkwildy()’. Once you understand it, it’s very simple.</p>
<p>Difficulty<br>
2/10, depending on experience.</p>
<p>Step 1:<br>
The first thing you have to do, is find out whether you have ‘InWildy’ (everything is safe apart from designated areas) or NonWildy (everything is dangerous apart from designated areas). Start, by opening you client.java and searching (by pressing Ctrl+F) and typing in ‘public void checkwildy()’. Above that there will be either;</p>
<ul>
<li>Public Boolean InWildy<br>
or</li>
<li>Public Boolean NonWildy</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have InWildy, your entire map is safe from player v player combat apart from the areas within the co-ordinates that come after ‘public void checkwildy()’. If you have NonWildy, your entire map is player v player combat, and characters can be attacked anywhere but the areas within the co-ordinates that come after public boolean cheackwildy().</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>Now, how to determine the areas? Well have a look at this;</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>if ((absX &gt;= 5601 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 5651 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 2654 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 2704))</p>
<p>If you understand what it does already, then this will be a breeze for you. If you don’t, it will still be easy if this tutorial is as good as I wanted to make it.</p>
<p>What does it tell you? Let’s break it down. The first part;</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>absX &gt;= 5601</p>
<p>This mean any co-ordinate greater than or equal to 5601 will be wildy/safe (depending on what you have). This diagram will help;</p>
<p>Basically, it says everthing to the right (greater than) of that co-ordinate is wildy. But that’s no good if we just want a small area. So we add the second part;</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>absX &lt;= 5651</p>
<p>This time it says everything smaller than or equal to 5651 is wildy. So now look what has happened;</p>
<p>By now, you should be starting to get the idea. Let’s do the other two, just so you’re sure. We add the third part now. This time it’s Y, not X, so we’re changing the vertical axes;</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>absY &gt;= 2654</p>
<p>After adding that, you’ll get this;</p>
<p>You got the idea? The last on now. You’re adding this now;</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p>absY &lt;= 2704</p>
<p>Once you’ve done that, you’ll get this;</p>
<p>Whatever is in the area that’s left behind is the safe/wildy zone. Don’t just use these co-ordinates, mainly because I don’t know where they actually are, they were made up, but you won’t want this area, you’ll want the area that suits your map. So experiment. Make a backup, so if you f*ck up, you can just restore it. Hope it helped and it wasn’t too copy and pasty, if it didn’t leave feedback explaining how.</p>
<p>Enjoy…[/quote]putting code plz</p>
