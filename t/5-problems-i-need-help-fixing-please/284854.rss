Problem-1
When I Port-Forwarded With U torrent Using This () Guide My Server Loads All The Way Up Until It Says Connecting To Update Server Than It Freezes.
I Have The Client Ip For Myself And Other People Set To Avenged-Scapers.No-ip.org,Am I Supposed To Set Ip For Myself To 127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0 And Let Other People Connect With The Ip Avenged-Scapers.No-Ip.org?

Problem-2
Banking Glicth When You Deposit Things It Gives You 2147m Of The Items Your Depositing

Problem-3
Running Glitch Makes You Lag And Also Glitches When You Run Making You Rune 10x Faster Than Usual

Problem-4
I Added A Party-Room Code In The Objectoption1.Java File In The Espeon Source Just Like The Tuorial Said But When I Compile I Get 49 Errors From That Same Files/Code That Was Just Added.

Problem-5
I&#39;ve Been Adding Alot Of Commands To My Server But These New Commands Ive Been Trying To Add Keep Giving Me Errors Such As &quot;Cannot Find Symbol&quot; &quot;Symbol Is Not Recognized&quot; And All Other Types Of Errors.


Please Try To Help Me Solve And Fix These Problems On My 508 Server Because They Are Pretty Major And I Can Get These Server/Economy Working Without Them
