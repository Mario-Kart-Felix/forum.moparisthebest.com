              <p>Well there certain servers the commands work with… I believe thats a deltascape commands if you try to add that command to a say allstar scape server it wont work. Even if there are slight differences between the commands its still different. Now i don’t have the mute command for my server but i hope this helped with you problem… if  i get the command i will post it back onto here.</p>
