    <title>We fixed the login crash</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/we-fixed-the-login-crash/549340</link>
    <description>After like 3 or more 2+ hour debugging sessions with myself, sinisoul, and zuppers, we finally managed to trace what exactly the problem was. Even after that, it took like 5 different attempts to finally come up with a fix that worked. It was a flaw in the services design with the source, but a few small changes made it work!


A HUGE thanks to zuppers, who came up with the solution we used in the end (and he found like 5+ bugs along the way that we fixed)!


With this bug out of the way, I feel MUCH more confident about being able to hold another alpha. Expect some news on that soon!</description>

She just flat out made a personal attack and that’s the one I responded to personally. Other than that I am just defending the base, explaining why we’re using it.</p>
<p>I’d just ignore her if I could, but silab is the type of person that would then respond to all of my posts with “wont even respond to criticism, shit developer leave server” and just continue the bring the project down. However, I don’t care about her opinions on the source because she said she hasn’t even looked at it. She was just taking something I said and twisting it to start an argument. So I’m just going to flat out say that yes, we’re sticking with this base. If sinisoul finishes his side project I might consider moving my stuff over if (and only if) it’d be fast and easy to do. Not gunna argue any more about it, sticking with that is working so far.</p>

I spent 12 hours a day talking to people about bugs, getting death threats, real life prank calls, and using whatever “free” time I had after dealing with all that shit to try and do some development. I hardly did any development on that base at all once it took off, so I don’t see why would I get mad if something didn’t work. There were metric shit tons of shit that didn’t work, and it wasn’t my code. The base was trash.</p>

I think the base is fine, it has a flaw that isn’t hard to fix.  It’s written by the same people that wrote some of the “well written sources” that you suggest we use. We haven’t run into <span class="bbcode-b">ANY</span> issues with the core outside of that.  All other bugs are from content we’ve added to it. But yes, I know how sinisoul works which is why while he is off having his little fun “new source” session I am still working on the current base (like I have been for the past year). He doesn’t slow me down, and I’ve been going for a while without burning out.</p>

<p>tl;dr - I’ve been using the base consistently since we started the project. This is the first issue I’ve run into with it, I still think it’s a good base and having one flaw doesn’t mean it isn’t. sinisoul does his own thing, doesn’t bother me.</p>

Why was it so hard to come up with a solution? Sounds like literally all you had to do was write the region load packet right after the response code, using the same output stream. No unnecessary checks or slowdowns this way, and the server would be free to do other stuff with the player without worrying about packet order.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>World player list isn’t synchronized between two threads. Design issue. Results in this.[/quote]You have no proof that that was the cause of this, and I’m even more inclined to doubt that is related because you tried to synchronize it and it had no effect. We fixed the issue without doing anything related to the world player list or other thread services at all. Not that it isn’t a design flaw, we had to fix another bug already because of that other issue.</p>
