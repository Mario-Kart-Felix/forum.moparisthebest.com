    <description>What skills would you reckon SPys and Intel Officers would need, or be good to have?


im currently about to start a course at uni, and hopfully become a Spy or Intel Officer. My course is a Double Major in Criminology with a Major in Phycology.


I am planning to make a list of skills and knolodge that would benifit people in the field of intel and then learn/do as many as possible before, things including; Vehicle Licenses, Languages, Fighting Styles/Skills, Firearm skills, Theif skills such as Lockpicking and car hotwiring, etc.
