    <description>What should i do?! I have a wireless card with such bad drivers that it freezes up the windows wizard thingy and i cant find any third party drivers that are compatable with windows. I have found Madwifi, but, i need something called HAL (hardware something something) but, it is not avalible for windows. I have not been able to find any other projects that are compatable with an atheros chipset! If anyone else has had this problem or knows any good WiFi projects (even for linux, if it will work on windows) then please post an tell me, currently my only option involves a gun....*ramble*[br][size=1]Posted at: April 25, 2006, 03:38:36 pm[/size][hr]prolly not the best place to post this, considering it has nothing to do with rs...</description>
