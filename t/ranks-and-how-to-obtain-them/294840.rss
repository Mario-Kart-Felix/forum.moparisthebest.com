<p>I may have a lot of Cookies, but not as much rep as some people on this forum. Moderators such as Archer, KO9 and I do not have 200rep yet we are Moderators. As Chassy13 said, its about how much effort and thought is put into your posts and keeping high standards (consistency). But, as Lothy once said, if you magically change from bad to good overnight, the staff will know. It is nothing to do with rep</p>

<p>A moderator is chosen by attitude and activity. I do not mean activity as in total time logged in, I mean how much work they put into these forums. A member is usually never chosen if they ask for moderator, as this makes us think they only want power. We go through a decent sized(for most) procedure while choosing moderators in a thread.</p>
<p>A MoparScape Vet is chosen by staff and other vets. A 2:1 ration in yes:no votes must take place. If most of us think the member is capable, they will receive the spot.
