    <title>Hyperion webclient (IFlaresoft)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hyperion-webclient-iflaresoft/386049</link>
    <description>So i decided to make a hyperion webclient, someone requested it for money, but i thought id just release it for free...

To start off, i did in like half an hour, so its very sloppy, and work needs to be done

I did this with the [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,471238.msg3446442.html#msg3446442]&quot;Iflaresoft&quot; client[/url] (Gravedig that topic and i will personally slaughter you), which has wide variety of files, so if it can be done for that client, it can easily be done for any other hyperion compatible client.

First things first, you&#39;ll need the jar maker program.

http://download.cnet.com/JAR-Maker/3000-2213_4-10588876.html

And winrar to open jar files

http://rarlab.com

You will also need a direct link host, i use http://ucoz.com, free direct link hosting, simply upload and your done with that, so thats why i use that.

Difficulty: 2/10


IM NOT GOING TO SPOONFEED YOU GUYS THAT MUCH! NO PICS OR ANYTHING! YOU DONT DESERVE THE WEBCLIENT IF YOU CANT FOLLOW A STEP BY STEP GUIDE WITHOUT PICS OR VIDS!!!

1.
Open up your client, go to your signlink class, open it, and change all the directories the &quot;474cache&quot; is read from, 
This
[code]./474cache/[/code]
To this
[code]C:/474cache/[/code]
This makes your cache readable from the local disk.
Like i said, this is a sloppy tutorial, didnt take much time to think about this, so thats not ALL you edit to be read from the local disk!

2
Go in your client class, and look for something like this:
[code]BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;config.cfg&quot;));[/code]

Change it, to look like this, so it is read from the C: drive
[code]BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;C:/474cache/config.cfg&quot;));[/code]

3
See the file called mapimagedumps?
Honestly, i have no idea what it does, something to do with a map XD
But i thought if its needed, ill just let it be read from the c drive, so we have change were thats loaded from to, so go to your
Class37 sub 9 sub 9

and search this or something similar
[code]File directory = new File(&quot;MapImageDumps/&quot;);[/code]
change that to this so its read from the Cache in the C: drive.
[code]File directory = new File(&quot;C:/474cache/MapImageDumps/&quot;);[/code]


Now that you&#39;ve done all that, compile, then open up your jarmaker.

Now you need to some things more than what you do with your regular client jarring.

4.
so open it up, put the name (Whatever you want the output files name to be) Put the input file were the class files are.

5.
Then open up advanced options

were it says &quot;Included Files/Directories&quot; 

6.
Add this:
[code].classpath;.project;[/code]

And close that

7.
Open up your manifest template, and put the main class as &quot;client&quot;

8.
there is also another text-box under it, named Class-Path

In there, put this:
[code]org.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER;[/code]

close that, make sure the option &quot;Generate bat file&quot; is checked, and generate the jar file.

9.
After that, open your new jar file with winrar, and see if there are any .class files in it, if there isnt, drag them into the jar file (All the class files from the flaresoft client) into it.

Now to get it to run.

Once again, this is VERY sloppy!
This is just a skeleton (kind of) how the webclient should be made.

10.
Now the batch file generated with the jar, open it up, and replace everything with this:
[code]@echo off
@title Webclient tut by drubrkletern
java -jar YOURJARSNAME.jar 1 live live highmem members english game0
pause
exit
[/code]
replace &quot;YOURJARSNAME&quot; with the jar you named your.. well jar.

This is basically the run.bat from the regular flaresoft client, except modified to read the jar.

11.
Now sign your jar (Normal signing)

And your finished!

12.
But this is another tricky part

You&#39;ll need to implement that run batch code i posted right above this text into your webclient&#39;s html code to get it to run.

I tried figuring it out by playing around with html, unsuccessful. Tried google, could only find results on pet bats being depressed.

Asked here, got bored, and i posted this, basically this is the anti-drub (drub = noob) You know, until someone posts it here, or goes on r-s and sells the html code and then the guy who bought it releases it here, or a more efficient version of making a hyperion webclient is released, until then, gf leechers.

Thanks for reading this, hope this opens another window in hyperion!

Post this on any other website and you die.</description>

<p>But this is another tricky part</p>
<p>You’ll need to implement that run batch code i posted right above this text into your webclient’s html code to get it to run.</p>
<p>I tried figuring it out by playing around with html, unsuccessful. Tried google, could only find results on pet bats being depressed.</p>
<p>Asked here, got bored, and i posted this, basically this is the anti-drub (drub = noob) You know, until someone posts it here, or goes on r-s and sells the html code and then the guy who bought it releases it here, or a more efficient version of making a hyperion webclient is released, until then, gf leechers.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this, hope this opens another window in hyperion!</p>

A Variety of webclient tutorials (So i could be familiarized with how the webclient works, didnt leech any codes)</p>
<p>Post this on any other website and you die.</p>
