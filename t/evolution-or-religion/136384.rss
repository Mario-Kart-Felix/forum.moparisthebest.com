    <title>Evolution or Religion?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/evolution-or-religion/136384</link>
    <description>Well, my world history teacher raised the question: &quot;Why are we here? How did we get here?&quot; The theory of Evolution that was stated by Charles Darwin had some information that said the we evolved from apes. Personally, I believe in evolution, but I don&#39;t agree with the statement the humans evolved from apes. 

I found a published timeline that shows the evolution of so-called humans. The first step on the chart is an ape by the name of [i][b]Austrolopithices[/b][/i]( I don&#39;t know if I spelled the right way). Now, during the the time period of [i][b]Austrolopithices[/b][/i],  the next step of the evolution chain came around. The next step of the chain is an ape by the name of [i][b]Homo Habilis[/b][/i], which stood a little more upright and had a larger brain. After [i][b]Homo Habilis [/b] [/i] came around, an ape by the name of [i]Homo Erectus [/i] came to be. This ancestor of [i][b]Homo Habilis [/b] [/i] stood even more upright, had a larger brain, and started using tools and mastered fire. Now we are on the forth step of the evolutionary chain. By now, [i][b]Austrolopithices [/b] [/i] has long since died out and so has [i][b]Homo Habilis[/b][/i]. [i][b]Homo Erectus[/b][/i] is still around. The forth step of this evolutionary chain is an a being known as [i][b][b]Neanderthol [/b] [/b] [/i] (the cavemen on Geico commercials :D), which survived til about 40,000 B.C.. Now why did this species die out. The fact is a new species, [i][b]Cro-Magnon[/b][/i], out-performed the [i][b]Neanderthol[/b][/i]. [i][b]Cro-Magnon [/b] [/i] is the modern human being, what we are. The problem is that the [i][b]Cro-Magnon  [/b] [/i] species did not evolve from [b][i]Neanderthols[/i][/b]. Basically, the modern human species popped up out of nowhere 40,000 years ago.

So how did we get here? We, the human species, obviously did not come of evolution. The Bible stats that we all came from a higher being, God as you know him. But where did God come from? How could He have possibly been here before we were? The fact is, Neither evolution or reliogion can give us a concrete answer to how we came to be.

Honestly, I don&#39;t belive that there will ever be an answer of how we got here, how all of this got here. How did the universe come to be? Are we the only higher life forms in this distant thing that we know as the universe? As for the question of how we got here, there will never be enough evidence to give an aboslute truth to our existence.

Any responses? :confused:


P.S. I&#39;m sorry about the incorrect spelling if there is any.</description>

<p>He was trying to say that Islam and Christianity go hand in hand and that proves that they are coorect, I told him that they also contradict each other. That is my point.</p>

sigh. Firstly, evolution can not be considered a theistic religion, it could possibly be construed as a non-theistic religion - I do disagree with that view however, religion is defined as a “set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, esp. when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs.”, evolutionism/darwinsm does not entail any of these things.</p>
<p>Evolution has not finished and will <em>never</em> finish untill the day that the universe is destroyed. “Why have we not got wings or gills yet?” - because we have no need for them, a human with wings or gills will not be best-suited for the planet at this time eg; A child is born with genes(possibly through mutation) that cause him to grow fully functional gills, this person will face ridicule throughout his entire life and would most likely never see the outside of his 4x4x4 cage, it is highly probable that he will not find a “mate” and thus he will not be able to produce any offspring and have his genes passed on. That’s a pretty crap example, but I’d assume you get the gist atleast.</p>
<p>Here’s a nice little quote often reffered to as “Russell’s Teapot”(I suggest you read it thoroughly, then read it again): “f I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is an intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.”</p>
<p>Religion is often inherited from one’s parents.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>But who decides that the planet is not suitable, non-other than God.</p>
<p>And if Religion is not true the why:<br>
The prophet Muhammed(PBUH), did not read or write, he had no knowledge of christianity or its prophets.<br>
Yet according to the Quran, every last prophet in the Bible is mentioned in the Quran.<br>
Also, before the “Original Christians” were iradicated and Catholism developed, the Prophets brother-in-law was a Christian Scholar and Priest, he tol Khadeeja(Muhammed(PBUH)'s wife) that there would be a Third Book, mentioned by the Bible, this occured after the prophet ran home from his first encounter with Gabriel.<br>
So how would the Muhammed(PBUH) have gained all this knowledge from the past.[/quote]</p>

The romans were the ones who brought this idea in by mixing there religion and christianity.<br>
Also isnt evolution in a way a non-practicing religion? People listened to prophets and people listened to Darwin.<br>
In my opinion, evolution is a lie, we did not evolve from anything, apes and fish is what Darwin says our ancestors are, if so then why dont animals communicate with us, why have we not got wings or gills yet, or at least started to adapt a new form of life?<br>
Because God gave us minds and souls (A mind is not a brain).</p>

<p>What? In reality, of course, they are not completely different things, evolution occurs through natural selection or/and genetic drift.</p>

<p>Evolution is not slow.

Not really incorrect. I was trying to explain as simple as possible the general idea of adapatations in evolution.</p>

<p>Uh… what would you expect it to do?  Completely rewrite and reinvent what actually happened?  Dumbass.  Of course it’s going to be the same.  The only difference is that Jews failed to see that Jesus was the savior.  They failed to see that the only time period a savior was predicted to have come was in a 200 year period that Jesus came and died.</p>

<p>thats actually the jewish belief. The chrisitans stole it.</p>

<p>Actually, if you did know something you would know that Christainity was under the Judaism branch and was a form on it while it was in it’s early ages so therefore it was a branch of Judaism which entitles it to the same belief due to the same infulence at the time of Christianity.</p>

<p>Because of the Christian belief in the book of Gensis where it says that God Created everything and in six days and then rested on the seventh. It also says that God created Adam out of his own image. Where-as evolution believes that we evolved and adapated to our surrondings. Like, their was insufficent food in the pond so the fish grew legs in order to adapt and live. They are contridactry things. That’s why Christianity is aganist evolution.</p>

</aside>
<p>Have you ever heard of theistic evolution or the day-age theory?  Most professors at Wheaton College are theistic evolution advocates.</p>
