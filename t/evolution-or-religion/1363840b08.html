<p>Evolution is not slow.  If 0.000000033% of all the people in the world had the genes to extract oxygen from water with their lungs or skin, and everyone in the world jumped underwater, then after 30 minutes or so, the entire human species would be able to breathe underwater.

<p>What? In reality, of course, they are not completely different things, evolution occurs through natural selection or/and genetic drift.</p>

<p>sigh. Firstly, evolution can not be considered a theistic religion, it could possibly be construed as a non-theistic religion - I do disagree with that view however, religion is defined as a “set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, esp. when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs.”, evolutionism/darwinsm does not entail any of these things.</p>
<p>Evolution has not finished and will <em>never</em> finish untill the day that the universe is destroyed. “Why have we not got wings or gills yet?” - because we have no need for them, a human with wings or gills will not be best-suited for the planet at this time eg; A child is born with genes(possibly through mutation) that cause him to grow fully functional gills, this person will face ridicule throughout his entire life and would most likely never see the outside of his 4x4x4 cage, it is highly probable that he will not find a “mate” and thus he will not be able to produce any offspring and have his genes passed on. That’s a pretty crap example, but I’d assume you get the gist atleast.</p>
<p>Here’s a nice little quote often reffered to as “Russell’s Teapot”(I suggest you read it thoroughly, then read it again): “f I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is an intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.”</p>
<p>Religion is often inherited from one’s parents.</p>

<p>But who decides that the planet is not suitable, non-other than God.</p>
<p>And if Religion is not true the why:<br>
The prophet Muhammed(PBUH), did not read or write, he had no knowledge of christianity or its prophets.<br>
Yet according to the Quran, every last prophet in the Bible is mentioned in the Quran.<br>
Also, before the “Original Christians” were iradicated and Catholism developed, the Prophets brother-in-law was a Christian Scholar and Priest, he tol Khadeeja(Muhammed(PBUH)'s wife) that there would be a Third Book, mentioned by the Bible, this occured after the prophet ran home from his first encounter with Gabriel.<br>
So how would the Muhammed(PBUH) have gained all this knowledge from the past.</p>
