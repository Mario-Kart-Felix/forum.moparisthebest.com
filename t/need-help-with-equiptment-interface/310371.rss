    <title>Need help with equiptment interface</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-equiptment-interface/310371</link>
    <description>hey guys, im using project fubergen v7.3.2 client and im having trouble using the equipment interface. The button is shown on the client, but when i click it, it does nothing.

Also to add to the trouble, i heard someone saying that i need to change something in class9.java. And i searched through the client and there was no class9.java only a class9.class. Would there be a way of dling the class9.java for my client?

If you guys know of, or could write me a little tut, it would be greatly appreciated.</description>
