              <p>Hmm. If anyone finds the problem (which I’ve spent a lot of time looking for) then please tell us where it is. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Basically it would never find the vertex. However I looked through the implementation of PacketHandler that takes care of walking, and there’s nothing wrong there. There shouldn’t be anything wrong with the conversion from absolute to relative coordinates either (that code was basically taken from the current ‘servers’) or anything like that. Odds are it’s a stupid little bug that has slipped past us on many occasions.</p>
<p>Good luck. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Have fun with it (if it’s the version that I think it is, then it’ll have the basis for inventories, banks, equipment screens, friends chat and so on).</p>
