    <title>The last time you logged on Runescape?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-last-time-you-logged-on-runescape/413736</link>
    <description>I know a lot of you here have played Runescape AT least 1 time in your life. 

Who started in 01/02/03? Have you logged on recently? If so, do you have extraneous amounts of wealth because of RSC?</description>
