    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/missing-window-in-edgeville-bank-please-help-me-pi/539232</link>
    <description>Hello, i have searched these forums and google for a fix to this and so far have found 2 or 3 posts with people with the same problem but so far no fix. there was 1 person who resolved it but didnt share how

my problem is one of the windows in edgeville bank is missing, i have searched objectmanager.java for the cords and there is nothing there deleting it and there is no issue with the map as the window actually loads but then just disapears as if its been deleted by something

thanks</description>
