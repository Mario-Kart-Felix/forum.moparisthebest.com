Hello and welcome! Allow me to explain what this competition is about. I&#39;ve gotten quite bored of RuneScape and have not played for well over 5 months, therefore I&#39;ve decided to quit. In conjunction with this decision, I&#39;ve decided to throw away my purple partyhat in a fun way.

Here&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do. Each participant that would like to play will be given a signature with their name on it and a hit counter. Whenever someone views this signature, your hit counter will go up. You can make the hit counter go up by posting, adding the image to your site or other forums, getting other people to help you by putting it in their signature, or be creative and think of other ways. The more you post with that in your signature, the more the hits will go up as people view your post. Please don&#39;t spam, keep your posts legit.

The person with the most hits within 24 hours will win. What&#39;s the prize? Technical ownership of my partyhat. For 48 hours, you are in full control on what I do with the partyhat. Whatever you tell me to do I will do it. For example, you may want me to lend it to you for 24 hours, sell it to a general store, die with it, anything you desire. I can provide proof I own this partyhat for any respected member that asks.

This is what an example signature image will look like:
[img]http://www.clamocracy.com/images/sig.php?name=Example[/img]

And this is what you need to put in your signature in order to participate:
[code]http://www.clamocracy.com/images/sig.php?name=NAME HERE[/code]

This name MUST be your forum name otherwise I will not be able to tell if you were the original participant or not. If your forum name contains characters other than letters and numbers, put something identical (for example, if my name was &quot;!Matt_JYK!&quot;, I would put &quot;MattJYK&quot; instead). No spaces or special characters allowed.

There is no harm in this, it&#39;s just a simple signature picture. I only have intentions to bring some fun so please play fair and don&#39;t take this competition too seriously. It&#39;s only for fun. If you win, good for you. If you lose, please be mature about it.

<p>Hello and welcome! Allow me to explain what this competition is about. I’ve gotten quite bored of RuneScape and have not played for well over 5 months, therefore I’ve decided to quit. In conjunction with this decision, I’ve decided to throw away my purple partyhat in a fun way.</p>

<p>The person with the most hits within 24 hours will win. What’s the prize? Technical ownership of my partyhat. For 48 hours, you are in full control on what I do with the partyhat. Whatever you tell me to do I will do it. For example, you may want me to lend it to you for 24 hours, sell it to a general store, die with it, anything you desire. I can provide proof I own this partyhat for any respected member that asks.</p>
<p>This is what an example signature image will look like:<br>
<img src="http://www.clamocracy.com/images/sig.php?name=Example" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>And this is what you need to put in your signature in order to participate:</p>

If your forum name contains characters other than letters and numbers, put something identical (for example, if my name was “!Matt_JYK!”, I would put “MattJYK” instead).
