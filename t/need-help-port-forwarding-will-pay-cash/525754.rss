    <description>Hello, I have returned for the first time in 5 years to the RSPS community, I used to host multiple servers and released sources etc. when I was just a little fella, but now I am back and don&#39;t remember how to do much of anything, after multiple failed attempts at portforwarding, then purchasing a linux VPS and completely forgetting what to do, I have wasted to much time and given away to much money for the VPS, so if someone could help me portforward and get my server running, I will definatley take care of you! you can contact me on skype (Crazycrashheim95) e-mail (kyleheim@live.com) or even just in this post, but help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks, Guardianman5

I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m aloud to do this so correct me if not, but I will pay via PayPal to get my server portforwarded and running.</description>
