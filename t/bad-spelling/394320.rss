    <title>Bad Spelling?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bad-spelling/394320</link>
    <description>I hate those people that just spell obvious compound words wrong, and then later on in the sentence or post spell both words correctly, or misspell the word yet again by putting a space between them. Perfect example: I just saw some guy that spelled &quot;maybe&quot; as &quot;mabey&quot; and how the fuck do you do that? Obviously &quot;MAYBE&quot; means it &quot;MAY BE&quot; so how the hell do you go off and spell it &quot;mabey&quot; hmm?

Don&#39;t even get me started on widely used abbreviations such as &quot;U&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; and shit. Honestly? Are you that damned lazy that you can&#39;t even type 2 more letters? It&#39;s your fingers, and buttons. I&#39;m pretty sure the developer of warcraft that started this extreme acceptance of horrible spelling and lack of care for it already killed himself long ago. Oh and those idiots that say &quot;damn stupid&quot; or &quot;damn dogs&quot; if you say &quot;DAMN&quot; you&#39;re basically saying &quot;God, I wish for you to damn this object I am referring to into the fiery pits of hell (no not armpits)&quot; instead of &quot;This noun has already been damned to hell&quot; which is the proper and more common use of the word as an ADJECTIVE rather than a verb, although people don&#39;t notice it. If I were to point this out to someone who does that, they would simply compensate for their unintelligence and say they were using it the other way.

Then there&#39;s all this shit about stupid names on games like &quot;LOLPKZSCAPE&quot; and shit. Are you fucking kidding me? Since when did that become more appealing than something like &quot;Hellgrounds&quot; or &quot;Fear System&quot;? Hmm?

I&#39;m sick of this horrible spelling here. Honestly, it couldn&#39;t get much worse than it is. I&#39;ve seen almost every word possible abbreviated and put into an acronym. The only time I use an acronym is when I&#39;m fucking around in real life and just decide to put a random fucking sentence into an acronym that I will then attempt to pronounce for no fucking reason, not as an excuse to not know how to spell something or some shit.

Is there ANYONE else that sees this from my point of view?</description>

All you are doing is raging because 11 year olds type like idiots (not all).  And did you ever think about how not all members here speak English as a first language?</p>
