    <title>317 webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-webclient/397335</link>
    <description>Okay so i was working on Hybrid PvP source, and working on making my first webclient, and so far i have jar and signed the client and done everything else. I&#39;m using webs.com as 000webhost was working for me. And no im not trying to advertize. But Webs doesnt let me have enough storage to upload the cache. So im using dropbox and used the html is provided me and put it in cachedownloader. I have everything right up to where the guide said &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;Your Webclient&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;PRAGMA&quot; CONTENT=&quot;NO-CACHE&quot;&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;

&lt;BODY&gt;

&lt;applet name=&quot;yourclientname&quot; width=&quot;765&quot; height=&quot;503&quot; archive=&quot;client.jar&quot; code=&quot;client.class&quot;&gt;
&lt;param name=&quot;java_arguments&quot; value=&quot;-Xmx1024m&quot;&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;

&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

WHat the guide said was to Create a new html or php page with the following ( as stated above) 
FOr this would i simply just make a new page called webclient and add that HTML code into a content text box or what? please help, will rep.</description>

              <p>Where did you upload the client jar file? If you didn’t upload it to your site and uploaded it to another file host (ex: DropBox) you’ll need to change the “client.jar” in the archive part of the HTML code to the direct link of the jar file. I don’t know if this is what your after or not. If your just wondering if it will work by just creating a new HTML page it should, not positive though, never really used Webs, but lemme tell you this, don’t use 000webhost cause in their Terms of Service, they say your not aloud to run gaming scripts. Apparently the client is considered a gaming script and they will shut your site down and ban your account without notice. So STAY AWAY! I suggest maybe using 0fees to host your webclient HTML script on. They have nothing about not having gaming scripts in there ToS :3</p>
