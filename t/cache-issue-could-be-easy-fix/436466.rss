    <title>Cache issue could be easy fix?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-issue-could-be-easy-fix/436466</link>
    <description>Okay, I downloaded a client and source a few days ago and was looking around to change the loading screen. As I was having issues locating the cache. I came to realize it was in the client folder. I moved it to the &quot;c:/&quot; drive and when I tried to load the client it gave me an error of &quot;Error loading please report.&quot; 

So i&#39;m getting the expression that the cache only loads in the client folder. Does anyone know how to change it to load in the c:/ drive?</description>
