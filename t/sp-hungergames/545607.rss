To get to our HG server from the hub, simply open the hub tool(The book) and click on the &quot;Sunny Paradise&quot; item, which is the Diamond Sword. There&#39;s also a big sign that says &quot;HG&quot; that will have a portal under it. You can step through that or use the hub tool(The book)

[B]Minecraft Version:[/B]
1.7.x

[B]Short Description: [/B]
We are here to have fun, just as you are. Our server currently has 2 arenas. One of them is called &quot;Catching Fire&quot; while the other one is called &quot;Steam&quot;. Both maps are incredible. (We do not claim the &quot;Steam&quot; map as our own! The owner made most of the &quot;Catching Fire&quot; map with the help of other people. Although the center of it was copied from another map) Our server staff are also very friendly and are willing to help with any problem or complaint you have. We hope to have you join us here at Sunny Paradise! Also note that we just started so our playerbase isn&#39;t too big. We could use your help in getting more players and attention!
The Hub has: Civcraft, Factions, Hungergames, PlotMe, Survival and finally, Roleplay!
Hope to see people joining :)!

Note that we used shaders when taking these.
