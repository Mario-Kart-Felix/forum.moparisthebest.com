    <title>641 Client...HELP!</title>

    <description>Hey moparscapers..
I got a 317 loading 641 source but the client is little fucked up cuz you need to put the cache in the C-Drive.
I am not lzay to do that but many people dont do that or they are too lazy they just dont wanna play my rsps..
So someone got a 641 client or a client that works on Impozzes Dicing 317 loading 641?

The problem is that i need a auto-cache downloader and not manually,someone can fix or something?</description>
