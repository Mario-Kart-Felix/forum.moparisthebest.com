    <title>School Break games?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/school-break-games/99608</link>
    <description>Hey i want to know what sort of games you guys have at break at your school?
 
Yeah sure i play &quot;it&quot; or more commonly known as &quot;tag&quot; and other random stuff at break... just to lighten the mood and forget that next lesson i have double biology...

Also a fun one that my school just found was if anybody farts you are allowed to punch them or beat them up untill they touch a door handle/knob (this is a very fun game but only rarely works because of the lack of people farting).   I also dont fart unless im standing next to a door handle lol.

So any fun things you have?</description>

<p>We haven’t played those types of games for years, but some of the shit we used to do included: Titty twisters(it got out of hand after a while and we’d do them so bad we’d bleed) and also I remember we used to hit eachother in the arm in a certain spot that would make it sore for a couple days. Hmm, bag slaps came back like last semester, my friend has a million of them on camera lol.</p>
<p>The only spare time I have is at lunch time, but I go home for lunch usually.</p>

<p>A footbag is the term for a small, round bag filled with dry grain (e.g. rice) or sand, which is kicked into the air as part of a competitive game or as a display of dexterity. "Hacky Sack" is the name of a brand of footbag popular in the 1970s (currently owned by Wham-O), which has since become a generic trademark.

              <p>We play that circle game where if you put your index finger and thumb together in a circle and someone looks at it below waist height you get to punch them in the arm.</p>
<p>Another one we play is that if someone flinches because of someone else you hit them twice.</p>
<p>Apart from that not many games :(…</p>
<p>edit: There was this shit game some people used to play where if someone had say a drink or sweets etc… and said fish the first person to say fish fish got all or some of whatever it was you had. I never played because it just sucked dick but alot of people did lol.</p>

              <p>Hey i want to know what sort of games you guys have at break at your school?</p>
<p>Yeah sure i play “it” or more commonly known as “tag” and other random stuff at break… just to lighten the mood and forget that next lesson i have double biology…</p>
<p>Also a fun one that my school just found was if anybody farts you are allowed to punch them or beat them up untill they touch a door handle/knob (this is a very fun game but only rarely works because of the lack of people farting).   I also dont fart unless im standing next to a door handle lol.</p>
<p>So any fun things you have?</p>
