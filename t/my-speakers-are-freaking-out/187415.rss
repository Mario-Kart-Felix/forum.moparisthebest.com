    <title>My speakers are freaking out!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-speakers-are-freaking-out/187415</link>
    <description>This started a while ago but I have 6 speakers, 2 attached to the monitor and 4 small ones that you can move wherever you want.  I also have a sub woofer.  All my speakers except 2 of my movable ones just stopped working one day and I have no clue why.  I didn&#39;t bother trying to fix it I just used headphones but about a month later my sub woofer started working again (still don&#39;t know why).  So does anyone have an idea of how I could fix this and why it happened?</description>

              <p>I’d go with the frayed wires, this can happen really easy with cheep cables (Like the ones that are usually supplied with speakers).  Invest in some decent quality cables, especially if you’re planning on getting some high quality speakers at some point</p>

              <p>I would say the wires might be frayed, and are working only in a certain position. It might also be that your drivers aren’t configured correctly. It might even be that it is your sound card, as exps35 said. I suggest updating your drivers, and if that doesn’t help. Then try what exps35 said. Use different speakers. If all else fails, buy a new sound card.</p>

              <p>You could have blown them out or a cable fried and you didnt know.  It could be your sound card (possibly) if only the front speakers are working.</p>
<p>Or they could just be plain old.  Try plugging in different ones to see if its a sound card problem or if its the speakers themselves.</p>
