    <description>Anyone here (in the UK) completed or done a year of the course?

I want to know what you really learn in it. For example, most universities say they do object oriented programming with Java as one module but don&#39;t say how advanced it goes.

Is anyone finding it hard/easy?</description>

What is the quality of teaching there like? Mediocre? Reasonable? Engaging?<br>
I’ve had some really horrible lecturers myself, and that’s something I’m curious about. It’s no secret that my university is pretty shit in many respects, so maybe that’s the real issue here (surely Australian universities don’t get much worse than Newcastle uni) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>For the record, IT does include some rather dry subjects that do involve Microsoft products (or comparable open source products :P). One particular subject covered databases and objects/entities; for some reason we had to make a game using ‘Gamemaker’ (a rather shitty little application that can be used to make sprite-based games).<br>
With any luck you’ll be spared from that kind of thing, but you never know. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
The compulsory courses can be quite bad, and sometimes they don’t have any value at all - it begs the question: why do they exist?</p>

              <p>I’m doing IT at university and, at my university at least, there’s a lot of crossover between computer science and IT.<br>
With that said though I’m sure that the advice/insight I can offer is at least partially applicable in Britain.</p>
<p>My Java-specific course was rather mundane, elementary programming at best. However it was an entry level course intended to get people on their feet and using a programming language.<br>
IT here only has one compulsory maths subject (discrete maths) which covers things such as graph theory, probability theory and set theory (not directly related to programming by any stretch and applicable in a wide variety of fields beyond IT and computer science, but the theory can be, and probably often is, used in real-world programming projects).<br>
Computer science has 3 maths courses (one being discrete maths, and the other two sort of continue on from high school maths). I haven’t done the other two courses (thank christ) because I don’t have to, so I can’t comment on them.</p>
<p>I’ve also covered a C+±specific programming course (a follow on course from the Java course to cover lower level concepts such as pointers, pointer arithmetic, templates and the STL, and use of other standard C/C++ header files). It also brought data structures into the mix (lists, queues, deques, stacks, maps, sets).</p>
<p>The more useful stuff at my university, and many others, obviously comes later on. I’m doing a distributed computing course at the moment which covers things such as client-server architecture, use of tomcat (java specific - I’d debate the appropriateness of using language-specific education at university, but whatever), distributed security/sychronization/etc.<br>
I don’t doubt that you’d at least have the opportunity to take part in some sort of security course which would cover things such as key and identify management, one way hash functions, public-private key encryption, password storage and so on, along with approaches to implementation of these things in an application (for example where the security should take place - at the client end, at the server front-end, at the server back-end (the database perhaps, to validate any input before adding it to the db), or from endpoint to endpoint).</p>
<p>I suppose what really needs to be pointed out is the biggest difference between IT and computer science.<br>
Computer science is heavily tied in with algorithmics, mathematical aspects and low level aspects of computing, and the more intrinsic details - namely the precise nature of program execution, process scheduling and management and so on. Frankly some of it is beyond me because I don’t do some of the CPU science courses.</p>
<p>Hope I’ve helped.</p>

<p>Taios do you know anything about the course at St Andrews (being as you’re on about another Scottish uni)? Like, how much Maths is involved and how complicated can algorithms be?</p>
<p>Did either of you have A-Level Maths before starting the course?</p>
