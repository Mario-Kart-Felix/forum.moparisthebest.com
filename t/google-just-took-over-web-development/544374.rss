I’m a little against WYSIWYG because in my experience they aren’t clever enough to know when to use padding, margins, or positioning correctly, but that’s probably an error on my part. I think I’ll try out the web starter kit.<br>

<p>Web starter kit is the framework :p[/quote]<br>
I know it’s the framework. I have no interest in the web designer.</p>

<p>Towards the thread, anyone who’s been here any length of time knows I’m a long time supporter of Foundation and always will be but it isn’t any better than Bootstrap, it’s just more obscure. Bootstrap vs Foundation is a pointless argument, it’s down to preference. People feel better using Foundation because it avoids the argument from retards like Ecko of other top level frameworks being overused and overrated.</p>

<p>Says the idiot who didn’t even bother checking the links from the OP to see what they actually were before making a completely ignorant comment on it. You know, that idiot who stated all these other frameworks were somehow better without even knowing what you were comparing it to.</p>
<p>Boostrap was recently updated and they still haven’t added form validation. Further, SASS is also significantly more extensive than LESS and allows you to do things much simpler.</p>

<p>Current version of foundation surpasses bootstrap.[/quote]</p>
<p>From what I remember F5 and BS3 were on par with each other (bear in mind I’ve not touched any development in at least 6 months) except for the fact that BS3 had a much much larger community and a lot more advanced support community whereas F5 was dead in comparison. If this is still the case then even if F5 is a little ahead of BS3 then the community itself makes up for it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I much prefer F5 but that doesn’t mean it’d be the best choice to make.</p>
<p>Edit, bootstrap was updated on the 26th of June… <a href="http://blog.getbootstrap.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://blog.getbootstrap.com/</a></p>
<p>Seems like bootstrap were working on it for 4 months, looking at the Foundation changelog in 4 months they still seem pretty on par <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/changelog.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/changelog.html</a> so I’m not sure what you’re talking about.</p>

Don’t worry, we’ve established in the last week that this little professional website developer is in fact retarded.</p>
<p>Towards the thread, anyone who’s been here any length of time knows I’m a long time supporter of Foundation and always will be but it isn’t any better than Bootstrap, it’s just more obscure. Bootstrap vs Foundation is a pointless argument, it’s down to preference. People feel better using Foundation because it avoids the argument from retards like Ecko of other top level frameworks being overused and overrated.</p>

<p>I didn’t really get the full effect to installing Foundation because it was a gem I used in rails :3</p>
<p>EDIT: I don’t really remember Foundation providing all of those shnazzy things…  I don’t know why I would need an HTTP server with my front-end styling framework.<br>

<p>I actually had difficulty setting this up at first (gulp turned out to be a pain to install). You also need sass and node.js (and something else I can’t remember).</p>
<p>Instead of just looking at the website, actually download it and try to use it.</p>
<p>I don’t see bootstrap giving you a http server, performance maintanance, cross device synchronisation etc.</p>
<p>Bootstrap just has more crummy components. Google are much better for responsive design. Bootstrap also has a terrible grid system. Golden ratio is so much better.</p>

Your second point I can agree with, but that has nothing to do with the framework itself…  That’s just you being butthurt about shit you shouldn’t even care about.</p>
<p>They totally should get on form validation.</p>
<p>I can’t say I use anything as of right now.  I have tried both Foundation and Bootstrap.  Both are great, to be honest.</p>

i’ve already shown how it’s overused, l2read</p>
<p>it’s overrated because there are much better frameworks (foundation) that one can use and a large portion of bootstrap’s user base are amateurs who hype it even though they don’t know how to utilize it properly</p>
