    <description>Is it permitted to delete other people topics without notice or reports? 
It happens to often people wonder where their command/topics went.
Just recently I asked for a special RSC related website, I asked for the source code or at-least the registration code.

Today the topic was suddenly gone.</description>

              <p>Your username kind of proves otherwise to be honest. The fact of the matter is and it was stated before that a moderator is well aware of what can and should be done, all decisions that are made on this forum is at their own discretion. If an administrator thinks otherwise and doesn’t feel that the moderator is doing a good job, he/she will consult with that moderator, otherwise it doesn’t matter what someone says because he/she isn’t suppose to argue with the staff team.</p>
<p>The RSC section isn’t moderated THAT much by the moderators except the sectional/global moderators of that board and therefore it honestly depends on what they think to do with the board. Just because that board is treated a little differently because of moderator(s); xEnt and Peeter think to do with the board doesn’t mean the rest of them are treated the same.</p>
<p>Of course your suggestion is ignored because as Miss Silabsoft said; “Every so often someone makes a thread like this and guess what happens? Nothing, because nothing is wrong with the moderation team to begin with.”</p>

              <p>[quote="`SJ_, post:16, topic:393965"]As Si Force said, moderators take action at their own discretion. We do what we have to, to keep the peace on the forums. If we didn’t do anything at all, the forum would be exactly like it was a few months ago.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Oh, at your “lame-easy-deletion” snide comment, we delete unneeded topics to keep the forum clean. Do we really want to see a bunch of locked topics in one board?[/quote]</p>
<p>Thats not fair to say because when I look at the RSCAdvertise section I see a bunch of locked topics (<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,119.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,119.0.html</a>) The topics that are locked are RS2 advertisements.<br>
So what you mean is that When I simple advertise my Clean server which is a RSC base, I get deleted BUT when someone advertise  RS2 server there they simply get locked ?<br>
The arguments you do does not make sense.</p>
<p>@ Si Force, You have done a great job moderating(RSC section), But All I’m saying you people have flaws and All I ask to simple stop deleting topics because it doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>And I’m 21 years old perhaps I do not always act like it, but can you blame me? I’m sitting on a forum where more then 50%(I think) of the people are under 15.</p>
<p>Actually do you know what, I don’t care its a baby forum where the mods don’t even listen to simple suggestion on how to make it a better place, you don’t even read what i’m saying. You calling me 11 by looking at my previous posts yet you are to stubborn to take simple suggestion. Since the mods are little older here I thought they would atleast moderate, act, listen without crying a river. good luck with the forum.</p>

I don’t know much about the moderation system since I’m not a moderator. Though when the thread is deleted it’s for a purpose, sometimes the moderator that deletes the thread makes a mistake sometimes. The thread has to have some sort of reason for being deleted and in the case of being deleted, their not required to send someone a message stating the thread is being deleted.</p>
<p>Correct me if I’m wrong.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re 100% correct.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not 100%  correct, since 2-3 of my threads got deleted for people reported it as a virus when it was 100% clean.<br>
I’m not here to make friends therefor I don’t care if some of the community dislike me. All I ask to moderate better.</p>
<p>Don’t randomly delete, lock it and add some “warning text”<br>
Don’t go with he first person who report a topic/thread. make some research scan it or whatever.¨<br>
Put some work into moderating otherwise you are not the person this forum needs.</p>
<p>Its actually common sense otherwise who have we else to relay on other then a moderator .</p>
<p>Oh and here an example where someone moderated bad.</p>
<p>I made a post asked for certain www files, next day the topic is gone. what I can think of is that the owner "peeter - RSC moderator " of the website didn’t want the topic there, therefor he deleted  it.</p>
<p>Fair?</p>
<ul>
<li>yes, DEAL WITH IT</li>
<li>Why do you lie ?</li>

<p>Yea, I mostly like the mods around here, you been good so as “si force”, but I just didn’t see any reason why my topics get deleted, here an exemple;</p>
<p>I have released a server called st()rk pk. some idiot report it as virus and it gets deleted with out notice.<br>
If I where a mod I would not delete it (topics and threads), perhaps give a warnign on the topic.</p>
<p>Its mostly a suggestion since its a community forum <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

It happens to often people wonder where their command/topics went.<br>
Just recently I asked for a special RSC related website, I asked for the source code or at-least the registration code.</p>
<p>Today the topic was suddenly gone.</p>
