    <title>Why does no1 know omfg?!¬!@&quot;$</title>

    <description>Alrite, i&#39;ve been after this since the start of november.. More than a month has passed, and still nothing...

I&#39;m trying to get something, which will allow me to control the Height of these masks..

[code]
mask100var1
mask100var2
[/code]

Yes yes, some of you may notice that it&#39;s used in the playerGfx method. Some of you may say, oh just use staticAnimation here is a method it will work i&#39;ve tested it.. staticAnimation methods, and stillgfx, always face south... 

I want facing gfx.. And that&#39;s the only method which does facing...

But it&#39;s only got int id, int delay...

mask100var1 = Id, E.G, 252 = Dds spec.

mask100var2 = Delay, Time the graphic is created.. Higher the number, more delay before the graphic shows...

The whole method looks like this...

[code]
public void playerGfx(int id, int delay) {
mask100var1 = id;
mask100var2 = delay;
mask100upate = true
updateRequired = true;
}
[/code]

Now how would i change the height of mask100var1? Is there another mask?..

Someone said it&#39;s to do with the delay.. But i&#39;ve tried that... All it does is make a delay on gfx.. Doesn&#39;t change the height at all.

Can someone please answer this, point me where i&#39;ve got to be looking..

Have i got to add another mask myself?
What file am i looking in to change height? Player/Client.
Is this possible? (Yes because i&#39;ve seen it on other servers)

Many thanks :|..</description>
