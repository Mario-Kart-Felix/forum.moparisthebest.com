    <description>I was looking at the old Runescape videos on youtube and somehow got side tracked and started looking at luring videos in Clan Wars. I got an idea for a PKing server but you need a Team/Clan to go into the wild or outside of home or wherever PvP is. I think there are alot of server based on individual PKing but not with Teams/Clans and that was one of the funnest parts in old Runescape or even today&#39;s Runescape ( even though it&#39;s so shitty now ). I dont really have any pictures because i havent started but IDK leave comments giving me your feedbac on is this a good idea? Or just forget about it. Thanks guys :D
