    <title>Tskill is not recognized</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tskill-is-not-recognized/52751</link>
    <description>Im trying to make an endserver.bat that closes out my runserver.bat and then closes itself. I see a lot of tutorials saying tskill java /a and stuff but i put that in notepad and save as endserver.bat and put in my server folder and all it does is open for a split second and then close out. So I used my hypercam to film it and it said..

&quot;tskill&quot; is not recognized as an internal or external command.

How do I make this work and/or how do I make an endserver.bat that works?</description>
