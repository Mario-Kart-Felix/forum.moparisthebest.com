    <title>Local SMTP server for SMF smtp_mail() fuction</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/local-smtp-server-for-smf-smtp-mail-fuction/338325</link>
    <description>Ok I am hosting my website from home, and I have having trouble with spammers on my forum. He is using a fake email every time, and his IP keeps changing. I realized that forcing activation via email is the best way to go here. So I changed SMF source to work locally rather than on an external web server that already has a SMTP server set up, and then installed a SMTP server on my computer. My question is, does anyone know of a better way to send email automatically, locally, rather then host a server?</description>

<p>I just have postfix running on this server to use from php’s mail function, I don’t have it configured to accept mail or route it or anything, as it’s not needed, SMF just sends it with a reply-to email of the forum administrator.
