    <title>Need help modifying server processing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-modifying-server-processing/167900</link>
    <description>Ok... I&#39;ve just found out my server has been processing things like attack timers, entaglement timers, etc. Incorrectly.
How i know this: 
I had noticed it before, 20 second entanglement timers were wearing off after 5 seconds.
I recently decided to look into the server processing - and found out the time between each call to processing varies depending on the time taken to process last time....

Example: 
Someone gets frozen - a timer is set to 40. 
The server usually processes and then sleeps for 500 milliseconds - so this should last 20 seconds. 
The player trys to move and can&#39;t, so mass clicks on their destination - being an idiot. 
This forces a load of extra packets to be processed by the server, making it take longer than the sleep time, so the server skips the wait between processing.
The timer is processed with no wait, causing the player to be unfrozen within about 4 seconds.

This shouldn&#39;t be like this, but i know if i force the server to wait at least 500ms between each processing, It would cause lag. 
Any suggestions on how to change this, without causing lagg?</description>
