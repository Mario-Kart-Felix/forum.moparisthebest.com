    <title>Huge server, which plan?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/huge-server-which-plan/406620</link>
    <description>I have a very *good i hope* question which i would like to ask.

I am hosting a server which i will be expecting to have around 200-300 members on average on it.

I was wondering what type of plan i should get for a VPS?

Like how much RAM i would need, and Bandwidth Allocation?

If anyone could answer it would help a ton!

Thanks.</description>

              <p>200-300 Players huh…? Well, You dont have that many right now sooo I suggest starting off with something simple like a 1GB VPS, Then when Server becomes more populated then you simply Just Upgrade to Whatever you need.</p>

              <p>It depends on which base you’re using. RuneSource can probably run that on a 512mb (really), while Project Insanity would need 1gb (prob. more).</p>
