    <title>What differentiates us from other communities?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-differentiates-us-from-other-communities/505532</link>
    <description>I recently signed up on Rune-Server, and started browsing through their site and some other less popular gaming communities.
Seeing that R-S gets a surplus of 400 members online daily, I started to think about what separates Mopar from other places.
Some factors that I&#39;ve come up with:

[ul][li]Mopar = SMF; R-S = vBulletin[/li]
[li]Mopar != transactions; R-S = transactions[/li]
[li]The toplist is integrated as a page with Rune-Server, Mopar offers it as an external page, open-source, and a redirect board.[/li]
[li]Rune-Server offers more membergroups to their members, with some of them being:
[list]
[li]Varied donator ranks[/li]
[li]The veteran rank[/li]
[li]Various guru-based membergroups[/li]
[li][i]Take note that the shown groups all have icons to go along with these ranks, while MoparScape does not offer icons for the first two.[/i][/li]
[/list][/li]
[li]MoparScape offers:[/li][list]
[li]Various post-based usergroups[/li]
[li]Community member[/li]
[li]MoparScape veteran[/li]
[li]Server helper[/li]
[li]Various guru-based membergroups[/li]
[/list]
[li]Each community tends to attract people with differing goals and willingness to learn and achieve.[/li]
[li]Falling under the same category as stated above, the maturity level of the members involved in each community tends to differ.[/li][/ul]

What [i]does[/i] separate one community from the next? Why are you here and not there?

Most of their moderators are incredibly bad. There’s only a few I actually like, Xenon, Rash, Method when he was still there. The rest of them are honestly more or less idiots. Especially from what I can see of scu11. Seems to try the whole Davidi2 tough love thing and epicly fails and appears to be a giant cock.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Flame_, post:1, topic:505532”]I recently signed up on Rune-Server, and started browsing through their site and some other less popular gaming communities.<br>
Seeing that R-S gets a surplus of 400 members online daily, I started to think about what separates Mopar from other places.<br>
Some factors that I’ve come up with:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Mopar = SMF; R-S = vBulletin[/li]<br>
[li]Mopar != transactions; R-S = transactions[/li]<br>
[li]The toplist is integrated as a page with Rune-Server, Mopar offers it as an external page, open-source, and a redirect board.[/li]<br>
[li]Rune-Server offers more membergroups to their members, with some of them being:<br>
[list]<br>
[li]Varied donator ranks[/li]<br>
[li]The veteran rank[/li]<br>
[li]Various guru-based membergroups[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-i">Take note that the shown groups all have icons to go along with these ranks, while MoparScape does not offer icons for the first two.</span>[/li]<br>
[/list][/li]<br>
[li]MoparScape offers:[/li][list]<br>
[li]Various post-based usergroups[/li]<br>
[li]Community member[/li]<br>
[li]MoparScape veteran[/li]<br>
[li]Server helper[/li]<br>
[li]Various guru-based membergroups[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[li]Each community tends to attract people with differing goals and willingness to learn and achieve.[/li]<br>
[li]Falling under the same category as stated above, the maturity level of the members involved in each community tends to differ.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>What <span class="bbcode-i">does</span> separate one community from the next? Why are you here and not there?<br>
Discuss.[/quote]<br>
SMF is actually a better forums software than vBulletin, a lot better. If we were to allow transactions and payments it would 1) completely fuck up the fundamentals and base thoughts on which the community was made and 2) there would be a lot more scamming. 3) If you knew anything about this you’d realise our toplist is actually integrated with our forums. It may not follow the same look, but the SSI is in place almost everywhere. If you start adding all these different rank it makes the community look like it’s run by an eleven year old and gives reason for more elitism (I paid more therefore I am better) or even I paid 50$ for my rank you can’t ban me arguments. Their community is also full of spoonfeeding and I’m just not cut out for that, I’ll happily help people but I’m not going to talk them through every single step every single time. In my opinion MoparScape is the original and best and I’ll be here for as long as there’s a set of forums for us to use.</p>

<p>Is that such a bad thing though? We always will have an influx of great programmers coming here and doing their own thing. I think that’s a valuable trait for us to have. While someone can go to either community, I believe our community mentors and receives programmers better than google does and even if they do leave (hateful to the community or not), we got to experience someone grow into something great.</p>
<p>EDIT: and while some of us might not know much about programming as a whole, we’ve know enough basics to get someone who can become great at programming to get them started with ease.</p>

              <p>My first impression of R-S was that the site is ugly.  As for R-L, well, just never bothered to navigate over there except for the Item, NPC, and objects databases.  I like SMF and this was the first site I joined and I’ve just kind of stayed around lurking for the most part.  I find it nice that people aren’t blowing up signatures with overly sized images or stupid flashing names, etc.</p>
<p>Plus, I’ve made friends here, but I talk to them mostly through IRC now.</p>
