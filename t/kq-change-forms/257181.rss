    <title>KQ change forms</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/kq-change-forms/257181</link>
    <description>Hey it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been coding, I got my new computer though, I&#39;m the person who ran Legendz PK. I had KQ switching forms a while ago, and basically what happened was:

There were 2 waves, one for the first form, 1 for the second. In an If statement, I would tell the server that if npc id for kq is killed (1158, If I remember right), it&#39;ll initiate wave 2. I remember that these were done in npchandler.java and client.java, but If anybody can give me some help, It would be much appriciated.

Thanks,
Legendz
