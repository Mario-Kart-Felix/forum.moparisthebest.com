<p>That was win.</p>
<p>So not everything illegal goes on a criminal record?</p>

<p>You didn’t answer my second question because you have no idea what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Explain everyone (and where the petition is that “everyone” signed saying they know I don’t give a shit) and how you know that?</p>
<p>Why would I be arguing about something I don’t care about?</p>
<p>I despise illegals. Is that not giving a shit?</p>
<p>Or did you mean to say I don’t give a shit about illegals, cause that is correct.</p>

        <p>Try to think the situation opposite. What makes people to cross the border and become illegal immigrants. When I was serving my country on Finnish navy we were on this maneuver south of Spain were we had to deal with rubberboat full of Moroccans trying to get to Spain. That was when I started to think what the fuck makes people even to try cross the Mediterranean Sea? They had travelled 100km and they had 100km more to travel. There were 3-7 small children on the boat and they had rarely any food left.</p>
<p>Ill try to find some pictures I snapped.</p>
<p>EDIT: All I found was this 1 picture. Be grateful you don’t have to be on that boat</p>

        <p>Ah yes we should report them. I didnt take the time read the pointless/racist posts from the little kiddies here. But I will say that I am not racist I have nothing against mexicans but they should come over the right way. Although prices of fruit and some other things would go up if mexicans didnt come over and do jobs for 3 dollars a hour! Ah and if u want to report them and are so worried then get a job at the border.</p>

Guy on watch spotted them (since rubberboat is too small to be spotted by radar). We started taking snapshots from the boat and called spains boarder guard. Since we were around 100km from Spains coast it took 1 hour for them to arrive.</p>
<p>We tried to keep distance from the rubberboat since we couldnt take them to our ship (otherwise they would have become Finlands problem). Our snapshots revealed that they had a small engine. Suddenly we saw something “small” dropping from the rubberboat to the sea. We were afraid that they might start jumping to the sea since in that case we should rescue them and take them to our custody. We were not sure was that something that fell from the rubberboat a possible human being. We mount our rescueboat, loaded our 12.7, and our rescueboat approached the estimated area where something fell from the boat. (All the time this Moroccans rubberboat tried to approach our battleship hoping that we would take them in custody since they had not get anything to eat or drink for several days). So when our rescueboat approached the area where something had seen in the water those Moroccans started to approach our rescueboat and all the sudden our rescueboats enginge shutted down. We got our rescueboat working in the last seconds and we didnt even had to shoot warning shots.</p>
<p>After 1 hour Spains boarder guard came and after that we didnt got any information what happened to those Moroccans. What I do know that it is fairly common that a rubberboat full of Moroccans is trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>Try to think the situation opposite. What makes people to cross the border and become illegal immigrants. When I was serving my country on Finnish navy we were on this maneuver south of Spain were we had to deal with rubberboat full of Moroccans trying to get to Spain. That was when I started to think what the fuck makes people even to try cross the Mediterranean Sea? They had travelled 100km and they had 100km more to travel. There were 3-7 small children on the boat and they had rarely any food left.</p>
<p>Ill try to find some pictures I snapped.</p>

<p>How did you ‘deal’ with them?</p>

</aside>
<p>Guy on watch spotted them (since rubberboat is too small to be spotted by radar). We started taking snapshots from the boat and called spains boarder guard. Since we were around 100km from Spains coast it took 1 hour for them to arrive.</p>
<p>We tried to keep distance from the rubberboat since we couldnt take them to our ship (otherwise they would have become Finlands problem). Our snapshots revealed that they had a small engine. Suddenly we saw something “small” dropping from the rubberboat to the sea. We were afraid that they might start jumping to the sea since in that case we should rescue them and take them to our custody. We were not sure was that something that fell from the rubberboat a possible human being. We mount our rescueboat, loaded our 12.7, and our rescueboat approached the estimated area where something fell from the boat. (All the time this Moroccans rubberboat tried to approach our battleship hoping that we would take them in custody since they had not get anything to eat or drink for several days). So when our rescueboat approached the area where something had seen in the water those Moroccans started to approach our rescueboat and all the sudden our rescueboats enginge shutted down. We got our rescueboat working in the last seconds and we didnt even had to shoot warning shots.</p>
<p>After 1 hour Spains boarder guard came and after that we didnt got any information what happened to those Moroccans. What I do know that it is fairly common that a rubberboat full of Moroccans is trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea.<br>

<p>I hope they made it somewhere safely. Do you enjoy your job? I would sure love to be cruising the sea on a battleship…[/quote]</p>
