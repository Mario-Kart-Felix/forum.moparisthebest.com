    <description>Hello I&#39;m launching A New Server Soon. I&#39;m Searching For more Coders to Make This Project A Sucess. To Let You Know You Will Be Coding On Devolution Dodian v7 Server Base. If I See Improvment In My project We Will negotiate Payment. All Coders Will Be An Official Administrator on The Server And To The Forums. I Will Also Need Coders For The Official Client For The Project. Please Only Apply if you Have Coding Experience.(I My Self Can Code But Not A Master At It)It Would Be Much Appreciated If You Code Clean please To Lower Lag To The Server.
