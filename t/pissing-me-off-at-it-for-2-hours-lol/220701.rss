    <title>Pissing me off...At it for 2 hours Lol</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pissing-me-off-at-it-for-2-hours-lol/220701</link>
    <description>Wow. This is probably the stupidest question I have ever asked, and doubt it will get answered. I was making 1v1 work like RuneScape, and started fixing a bug. Now its giving me these stupid errors for some reason. Like the int that defines it is right above it, and it can&#39;t find the symbol. And now it gives me an error saying it can&#39;t return a method which type is void is false or something. My question, Kind of, Is...Did I delete something? Or do something wrong... I&#39;ve been fucking with this for 2 hours.</description>
