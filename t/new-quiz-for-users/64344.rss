    <title>New Quiz For Users</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-quiz-for-users/64344</link>
    <description>Hello,

I think that there should be a quiz for users who are abusing the moparisthebest forum. There should be three quizzes. The three quizzes are designed for users who have been warned, moderated, or muted. Right after a user was given one of the statuses (warned, moderated, or muted), they would need to take the test to be able to access the moparisthebest forums. Each of the quizzes will pertain to what the user did wrong, and what they can do to prevent future warnings. If it isn&#39;t too much trouble or work, I thought that the quizzes could be multiple choice. I think some people are oblivious as to why they have been given a status (warned, moderated, or muted) unless you tell them why, as I would not know as I haven&#39;t been given a status.

Here is an example of a quiz question for warned users:
1) Why do you think you have been warned.
  a)Continuous spamming.
  b)Helping people out.
  c)Asking questions.
  d)Posting too much.

Obviously, the questions would be harder, I assume...Anyway, what do you think?

Thanks,
Leader</description>

<p>I thought it might be better to get support before I contacted them - the mods and administrators. Anyway, the moparisthebest staff looks at this section of the forum.</p>
