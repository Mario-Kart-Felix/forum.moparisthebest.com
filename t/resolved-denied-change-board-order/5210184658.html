<p>like I said ruby i see nothing wrong with the moparcraft section but I still believe more focus should be insinuated on the sections that actually get the most activity. (besides general discussion)[/quote]I’d just like to point out that location doesn’t affect activity at all (this has been proven in the past) and having Minecraft stuff mixed in with RuneScape stuff has no effect on what the community focuses on.  This wasn’t directed towards you, I just thought I should make the point.  But I’ll say this again, If you guys don’t like certain boards, hide them.  You will never have to deal with them.</p>

<p>like I said ruby i see nothing wrong with the moparcraft section but I still believe more focus should be insinuated on the sections that actually get the most activity. (besides general discussion)<br>
[/quote]I’d just like to point out that location doesn’t affect activity at all (this has been proven in the past) and having Minecraft stuff mixed in with RuneScape stuff has no effect on what the community focuses on.  This wasn’t directed towards you, I just thought I should make the point.  But I’ll say this again, If you guys don’t like certain boards, hide them.  You will never have to deal with them.[/quote]<br>
And like I’ve said already, it’s not to do with the boards that I like and don’t like. I use nearly all of the available boards, so there is no need for me to hide any of them. The majority of users will come here not for the community, not for MoparCraft itself, but for RS2 emulation. This can be seen just by comparing the activity in each section. For this reason, it makes logical sense to have the boards which guests will be most interested in at the top. If location has no effect upon activity or focus then where’s the harm in changing them to a more logical format so that a new user will not be overwhelmed by the amount of junk that they must scroll through to reach the boards they came here for?</p>
<p>I suggest you do some research on the “new user experience” (<a href="http://mashable.com/2010/11/28/best-ux-ui/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> would be a good place to start) before you say that “users can hide sections” is a good solution. It’d be interesting if one of the admins could provide analytics for how many new users leave on the index page.</p>

Moving them has no benefit other than not having to use your mouse to scroll down once.</p>
<p>I suggest you do some research on your facts before you say that “moving the boards will make it easier for people to find rs2 server boards”.  Moving the boards have no upside nor do they have a downside, so why move them at all?  Users who are here for discussion alone will visit those boards, people here for rs2 will visit those boards, and people who are here for RSC will visit those boards.  RSC users who use the RSC section have no problem scrolling down a bit to find the section they want.  Like I said there is no upside or downside to moving the boards around, it has been proven in the past.  Again, RSC section gets activity and they are at the very bottom of the page.  If this site has what you are looking for, you are not going to just leave and never come back because your board isn’t at the very top.</p>
<p>Also, someone made the point of this being Mopar<span class="bbcode-b">Scape</span>, so this site should focus on Rune<span class="bbcode-b">Scape.  </span>In that case, the general discussion board should be at the very bottom of the board, or removed completely (or moved to a different site for that matter) instead of being 3rd on your list (2nd if you only count the boards available to every user).  Oh, and since this is a rs2 emulation site, we won’t be needing the announcements board, since no announcements pertain to rs2 emulation.</p>
<p>Also, general interests &amp; hobbies should be removed or put on another site because this is mopar<span class="bbcode-b">scape</span> not mopar<span class="bbcode-b">webdev</span> or mopar<span class="bbcode-b">gametalk</span>.</p>

<p>It makes no difference to me or any other user who’s been here for a while but someone who is looking for a community based on RS2 emulation will see the number of boards before the RS2 emulation and, if they don’t look into the content of the boards then they’re just going to think we’re a site that doesn’t focus on RS2 emulation and will go to another site such as google or Rune-Server. If board order is unimportant, and the boards at the top aren’t necessarily the most focused-upon, why is the Announcements board at the top?</p>

Don’t be such an idiot. I never said that non-RS2 boards should be removed, Ruby said that the site isn’t based on RuneScape (which is evidently is).</p>

We have the least amount of boards to scroll through, and the least amount of non-rs2 boards of another other main private server sites.  IIRC rune-server has it so you can only view a certain amount of threads before logging in, and you must change your password every month or so before you can view the forum, so if anything, Moparscape has the least amount of problems to go through before getting into the rs2 emulation part of the site.</p>

<p>There is no lesser focus on this website, I’m not going to repeat myself again. This site focuses on all of its efforts with equal efforts.

we have a dayz server?<br>

        <p>In my opinion, it doesn’t matter. The only thing I can say on the matter is that the ordering should be logical and easy to recognize where boards are/should be so that users don’t waste time searching for boards.</p>

<p>At the moment I have to scroll quite far to get to any RSPS development boards. I suggest this order would be more appropriate:</p>

<p>100% Agree. Moparcraft isn’t that special they should be close to the bottom and Rs2 Emulation needs to be way more closer to the top for god sake its called <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> for a reason…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Blasphemy… Just because you don’t use it doesn’t mean it’s not special.<br>
[/quote]I have nothing wrong with moparcraft but as this is a rs2 emulation site then the lesser focuses on the site should be lower on the chain.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There is no lesser focus on this website, I’m not going to repeat myself again. This site focuses on all of its efforts with equal efforts. MoparCraft is no lesser important than RS2 developments, help, whatever. The dayz server is no lesser important that MoparCraft or MoparScape, we are one. Just because one was here first doesn’t mean that it’s more or less important.[/quote]Uhm… What the fuck are you talking about? A forum centered primarily around and created for RuneScape private server development focuses as much on a little game that got a playable server a couple years ago compared to what it was made and still exists for? Yeah, okay buddy.</p>

        <p>itt elitism at its best, idiocy, and faggots who can’t hide the boards themselves.<br>
ot; who gives a shit whether this site was created over runescape, minecraft, ponies, or anything in the like.</p>
<p>this site, or any site in the world, cannot cater to the likings of all it’s userbase, and should no way in fact, suit the needs for the majority of the userbase.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">lets be smart about this and order the boards in a more fashionable way: alphabetical!</span></p>
<p>on a serious note; the boards should be rearranged, no doubt about it. runescape was this sites main focus, and always will be the main focus. but we must face the facts. moparscape is dying in the scene of runescape development, and lacks far behind it’s sister sites. though, this doesn’t mean we should push it to the top (to improve the importance) or push it to the bottom (and let it die more) we should come up with a better solution to progress the development (ha, the users on this site probably have issues adding imports, let alone progressing our community) and we cannot always rely on the <em>knowledgeable</em> users to do it for us.</p>
<p>i do believe web design/graphics should not be above the runescape section in any way. it’s a great addition and all, but it’s not of greater importance that our sole reason for being on this site.</p>
<p>general programming should always remain at the top, as we need [our users] to advance further in actual oop/programming comprehension. and they don’t learn a great bit inside the tutorial/help sections.</p>
<p>reviews/talk about games should fall somewhere with the general discussion category, and i’m not too sure about moving it to the bottom of the site/keeping it at the top.</p>
<p>i personally believe ‘announcement category’ should be retitled to ‘Offical MoparSkep shit’ or something along the lines for more professionalism, and the community suggestions board should fall directly underneath the announcement board.</p>
<p>the runescape/rsc/client sections should remain in-tact by staying together: but rsc is just about as dead as client hacking. we could possibly through the rsc <span class="bbcode-b">above</span> rs2 to perhaps improve it’s visitation (or just because rsc predates rs2)</p>
<p>the rs2 <span class="bbcode-u">category</span> could perhaps be</p>
<p>[ul][li]General Server Discussion (possibly a subsection for client (even though it’s not too fond for discussion of client updates/some stickies could be made such as ‘ideas for interfaces’ or ‘client discussion for improvements to loading data/etc’<br>
[/li][li]Server Help[/li]<br>
[li]Client Help[/li]<br>
[li]Server Tutorials[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]Features[/li]<br>
[li]Snippets[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[li]Client Tutorials (not so much of ‘hacking’ as the reverse engineering parts have all been done for us / nobody really deobs new clients on this site[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]Features[/li]<br>
[li]Snippets[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[li]Development (whether it be client or server, who cares? its a section to show off <span class="bbcode-b">your</span> development progress (and there are some people who only work on clients)[/li]<br>
[li]Downloads (the users should be able to provide whether it be a download for a client or server)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>tldr; this is the most i’ve ever/will ever typed. so you may want to read it (go vain++)</p>
