    <title>[RESOLVED - DENIED]Change board order</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-denied-change-board-order/521018</link>
    <description>At the moment I have to scroll quite far to get to any RSPS development boards. I suggest this order would be more appropriate:


[ul][li]Announcements[/li]
[li]Secret boards (Staff, etc)[/li]
[li]General Category[/li]
[li]RuneScape 2 Server Development[/li]
[li]RuneScape 2 Client Development[/li]
[li]RuneScape 2 Server Advertising[/li]
[li]RuneScape Classic[/li]
[li]General Interests and Hobbies[/li]
[li]RuneScape[/li]
[li]MineCraft[/li][/ul]</description>

<p>Why does board order matter? Not haten</p>

</aside>
<p>Because some people only use the programming side of the forums, some use the graphics or web design. It isn’t a necessity but it is a nice little modification to have. Though it would be even nicer to have the current layout set to default so nothing else gets muddled up on the update (if there will be one), some people just like how it is already.</p>

ot; who gives a shit whether this site was created over runescape, minecraft, ponies, or anything in the like.</p>
<p>this site, or any site in the world, cannot cater to the likings of all it’s userbase, and should no way in fact, suit the needs for the majority of the userbase.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">lets be smart about this and order the boards in a more fashionable way: alphabetical!</span></p>
<p>on a serious note; the boards should be rearranged, no doubt about it. runescape was this sites main focus, and always will be the main focus. but we must face the facts. moparscape is dying in the scene of runescape development, and lacks far behind it’s sister sites. though, this doesn’t mean we should push it to the top (to improve the importance) or push it to the bottom (and let it die more) we should come up with a better solution to progress the development (ha, the users on this site probably have issues adding imports, let alone progressing our community) and we cannot always rely on the <em>knowledgeable</em> users to do it for us.</p>
<p>i do believe web design/graphics should not be above the runescape section in any way. it’s a great addition and all, but it’s not of greater importance that our sole reason for being on this site.</p>
<p>general programming should always remain at the top, as we need [our users] to advance further in actual oop/programming comprehension. and they don’t learn a great bit inside the tutorial/help sections.</p>
<p>reviews/talk about games should fall somewhere with the general discussion category, and i’m not too sure about moving it to the bottom of the site/keeping it at the top.</p>
<p>i personally believe ‘announcement category’ should be retitled to ‘Offical MoparSkep shit’ or something along the lines for more professionalism, and the community suggestions board should fall directly underneath the announcement board.</p>
<p>the runescape/rsc/client sections should remain in-tact by staying together: but rsc is just about as dead as client hacking. we could possibly through the rsc <span class="bbcode-b">above</span> rs2 to perhaps improve it’s visitation (or just because rsc predates rs2)</p>
<p>the rs2 <span class="bbcode-u">category</span> could perhaps be</p>
<p>[ul][li]General Server Discussion (possibly a subsection for client (even though it’s not too fond for discussion of client updates/some stickies could be made such as ‘ideas for interfaces’ or ‘client discussion for improvements to loading data/etc’<br>
[/li][li]Server Help[/li]<br>
[li]Client Help[/li]<br>
[li]Server Tutorials[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]Features[/li]<br>
[li]Snippets[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[li]Client Tutorials (not so much of ‘hacking’ as the reverse engineering parts have all been done for us / nobody really deobs new clients on this site[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]Features[/li]<br>
[li]Snippets[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[li]Development (whether it be client or server, who cares? its a section to show off <span class="bbcode-b">your</span> development progress (and there are some people who only work on clients)[/li]<br>
[li]Downloads (the users should be able to provide whether it be a download for a client or server)[/li][/ul]</p>

I’ve already said that it’s not about the boards I personally visit, but the fact that the boards don’t really seem to be in any logical order at all. It’d make the forum a lot more attractive if there was some kind of order behind the board arrangement.<br>

You need to visit xda-developers and look at how the boards are there. Board arrangement does now get you new members nor does it lose members.[/quote]<br>
It’s all phone-based, and again is in a logical order. There’s announcements and then phone boards.</p>

</aside>
<p>Haha, it would just make the forum look a bit nicer if there was some kind of logic behind it. The forum is (no matter how much people deny it) based on RS Emulation so I can’t understand why all boards relating to it have been pushed to the bottom.</p>

<p>OT: Merge MITB and MSCP together, so then it’s everything all in one. And the order won’t matter since it’s a multi-forum <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>

              <p>itt elitism at its best, idiocy, and faggots who can’t hide the boards themselves.<br>
ot; who gives a shit whether this site was created over runescape, minecraft, ponies, or anything in the like.</p>
<p>this site, or any site in the world, cannot cater to the likings of all it’s userbase, and should no way in fact, suit the needs for the majority of the userbase.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">lets be smart about this and order the boards in a more fashionable way: alphabetical!</span></p>
<p>on a serious note; the boards should be rearranged, no doubt about it. runescape was this sites main focus, and always will be the main focus. but we must face the facts. moparscape is dying in the scene of runescape development, and lacks far behind it’s sister sites. though, this doesn’t mean we should push it to the top (to improve the importance) or push it to the bottom (and let it die more) we should come up with a better solution to progress the development (ha, the users on this site probably have issues adding imports, let alone progressing our community) and we cannot always rely on the <em>knowledgeable</em> users to do it for us.</p>
<p>i do believe web design/graphics should not be above the runescape section in any way. it’s a great addition and all, but it’s not of greater importance that our sole reason for being on this site.</p>
<p>general programming should always remain at the top, as we need [our users] to advance further in actual oop/programming comprehension. and they don’t learn a great bit inside the tutorial/help sections.</p>
<p>reviews/talk about games should fall somewhere with the general discussion category, and i’m not too sure about moving it to the bottom of the site/keeping it at the top.</p>
<p>i personally believe ‘announcement category’ should be retitled to ‘Offical MoparSkep shit’ or something along the lines for more professionalism, and the community suggestions board should fall directly underneath the announcement board.</p>
<p>the runescape/rsc/client sections should remain in-tact by staying together: but rsc is just about as dead as client hacking. we could possibly through the rsc <span class="bbcode-b">above</span> rs2 to perhaps improve it’s visitation (or just because rsc predates rs2)</p>
<p>the rs2 <span class="bbcode-u">category</span> could perhaps be</p>
<p>[ul][li]General Server Discussion (possibly a subsection for client (even though it’s not too fond for discussion of client updates/some stickies could be made such as ‘ideas for interfaces’ or ‘client discussion for improvements to loading data/etc’<br>
[/li][li]Server Help[/li]<br>
[li]Client Help[/li]<br>
[li]Server Tutorials[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]Features[/li]<br>
[li]Snippets[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[li]Client Tutorials (not so much of ‘hacking’ as the reverse engineering parts have all been done for us / nobody really deobs new clients on this site[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]Features[/li]<br>
[li]Snippets[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[li]Development (whether it be client or server, who cares? its a section to show off <span class="bbcode-b">your</span> development progress (and there are some people who only work on clients)[/li]<br>
[li]Downloads (the users should be able to provide whether it be a download for a client or server)[/li][/ul]</p>
