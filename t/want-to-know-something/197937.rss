    <description>The amount of pathetic fucking threads here such as:

here is the code someone gave  me.

[quote]case 4408: // attackportal
            if(playerLevel[0] &gt;= 99)  {
            teleportToX = 3087;
            teleportToY = 3511;
            sendMessage(&quot;99 Attack Guild&quot;);
            break;[/quote]

Whats the problem? [br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 08, 2008, 08:01:31 PM[/size][hr]bump[/quote]

99% of what gets posted on these forums is shit my fucking 1 year old sister could do.

Well, if you&#39;re not a retarded little kid like 99% of the forums here (meaning you&#39;re part of the special 1% that does know how to add fakin sileb itams, or basically are interested in programming your server by yourself and only getting help on real parts of the server which need help (example: real java errors such as java math) then this is the place for you:

[size=5][b]http://forum.java.sun.com/forum.jspa?forumID=31&amp;start=0[/b][/size]

This isn&#39;t a fucking joke i&#39;m being serious, i&#39;ve started a server from nothing, i&#39;ve needed help twice (with real java not how to mek npc hit higer11!1!.) and both times it&#39;s been sorted, if you really are interested in getting professional help just use it. You will need to register! There is also a forum on here dedicated to JDBC, get help connecting to MySQL!

I swear to god, don&#39;t make yourself look a twat and go here asking directly asking for help for runescape private server issues such as &quot;y dunt me npc hit 5000 i wont it 2 hit 5000 but it dunt ffs wot rong?&quot; it&#39;s for proffesional questions only.

If you go there with a positive attitude you will be helped every time you need it.

[size=3][b]Remember: this is a proffesional forum used by java programmers for over 10 years, you will be helped by java experts. Don&#39;t act like a fucking retard here, adults use this site to get help with java coursework, etc.

Use it wisely, because quite frankly moparscape is going downhill, until all the retarded &quot;coders&quot; (as they like to call themselves, obviously because they know how to change the text that is displayed when you sign on) leave.[/b][/size]

Enjoy.</description>
