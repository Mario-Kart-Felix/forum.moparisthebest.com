              <p>[quote=“twinpkk02, post:2, topic:241115”]ok first off i will answer each one.</p>
<p>1.) rebooter is easy, just download the file or you can take it from another server source and drag it into your’s</p>
<p>2.) Most server have this already, if yours does not then you might need to look in the TUT section to find out how to add it.</p>
<p>3.) You will need to go into the client.java and look for the giveplayer xp and change the xp rate to what you want</p>
<p>:)[/quote]</p>
<p>1.) he wasn’t asking for a rebooter, he was asking how to set an in-game timer as to when the server would reboot. I don’t know the answer to that though, i haven’t really though about that. tbh, rebooters are a waste.</p>
<p>2.)His server does have it, but he wants it to where the number updates itself, without moving, or making your character file update. To do that, you would have to have a counter and an update system set, but that would lag pretty bad. I’m not sure how to perform that all together.</p>
