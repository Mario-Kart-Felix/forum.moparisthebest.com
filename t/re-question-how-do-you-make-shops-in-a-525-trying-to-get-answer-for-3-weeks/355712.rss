I found this 525 source and client I want to use but it didn&#39;t have any shops in it and I am fairly new to 525&#39;s. I was wondering if anyone could point me to a tutorial or something...? I&#39;ve spent at least two days altogether searching (not 2 days straight but its just to show the point). So could anyone please help with this? It would help a LOT! :) ;)

Thank you,
Ghostly150
