    <title>2 questions (Delta)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-questions-delta/364705</link>
    <description>First Question:
i have working pk points in my server (demise pking, delta) and i believe its set up in the way that a certain shop is given the &quot;system&quot; and then the items are given values for kills, like 2, 5, etc. i took my donar shop and switched it (non donars can go in and donars cant lol) and it has a pvp values like the pk shop. it says kills too, like &quot;this item cost #$%#@!#$ kills.&quot; instead of coins, so thats step one. i put the pvp value &quot;item #### == 2&quot; (&lt;-- example) but when you click the item to see the value, it just takes the value of a working one that you clicked before. [u]how could i make it stable?[/u] if you need any more info feel free to tell me, i tried my best atm explaining this :p

second question:
when is started using the source, if you tele&#39;d to a certain area (ex Cammy bank using ::tele #### #### not a magic button) a lumbridge guide would spam ur text box and make u walk back &quot;inbounds&quot; it makes it so you cant move to certain places, which is quite upsetting. if anybody knows the demise pking source and client, then try and help please :P make the lumby guide goooo awayyyyy lol (its late for me atm :P)

sorry it&#39;s long..i tried to go into as much detail as i could lol</description>
