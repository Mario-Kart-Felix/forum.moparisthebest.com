    <description>So, I have the server from here http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,512994.0.html and i have everything correct. I changed the ip to my no-ip, but my friends still get join. I changed the ip&#39;s in the client.java and the GUI.java, which should be everything i need. I have the server portforwarded and still nothing. I tried it with another server also, and it worked so I must be doing something wrong here. Please help.</description>
