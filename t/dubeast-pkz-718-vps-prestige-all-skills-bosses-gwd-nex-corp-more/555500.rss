NOW WITH PRESTIGING AND VPS

-------------------------------------------Summary----------------------------------------
Dubeast-Pkz was a 317 PK server, and has now been transferred to a 718 Eco, boss-fighting, and PvP server. If you enjoyed 718 RS but did not want to put in the countless hours of time and the effort, this is the server for you. There are many many things to do, so no matter the amount of people online, there is always fun. As a java developer, I will be taking this source to the next level, from its original state (InsidiaX) and making it my own. The server has a stable XP rate, as well, so it takes effort, but allows you to play at a fun pace while still having to work a little bit.


[B]Why this could be the RSPS for you:[/B] Friendly and dedicated staff, you will get a great playing experience with constant updates, 24/7 uptime (VPS), and great gameplay with minimal bugs and all your favorite things to do in RS.


Features:
This server includes all that you can imagine in a 718 - curses, dungeoneering, summoning, boss-fighting, Corporeal beast, and much more. Log on to start your quest to max level and get your completionist cape, as every skill in the game is FULLY FUNCTIONAL.
