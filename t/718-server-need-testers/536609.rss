    <title>718 server - NEED TESTERS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-server-need-testers/536609</link>
    <description>I have started a 718 server called Rune-Hive. i want to get it up and running to the public as soon as possible. i am looking for about 5-10 people to come test the skills and features along with me to get things moving a bit faster.

Whoever decides to help will automatically receive an extreme donator rank.

If you find any bugs while playing be sure to tell me and you will be rewarded.

I am looking for people who are willing to test each and every skill (dung is still being worked on)

For those who are very helpful to me and to the server will receive staff ranks when it is ready to go online to the public.

If you are interested please pm me or post here and i will send you the link to the client. If the cache does not automatically download please let me know and i will send you the link and tell you where to put it.</description>
