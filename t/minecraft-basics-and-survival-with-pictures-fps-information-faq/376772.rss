[size=18pt]Introduction[/size]
[anchor=introduction]

This post is all about surviving your first night in minecraft, it comes with basic information on blocks and mobs, also it shows FAQs, tips, tricks and possible mistakes which are commonly made. As always suggestions are appreciated! I&#39;ve updated the guide ALOT recently, it now contains general information about the official server and moral stories. 

Minecraft is a block based game made by Notch. It creates a randomly generated world when the map loads. The general aim of the game is to explore, survive and make cool buildings! Some servers can be put into peaceful mode, this way no dangerous mobs spawn and the aim of the game is to create cool buildings and have fun - meaning you don&#39;t need to worry at night. 

Minecraft can take up A LOT of your resources, so it is advised that you end non-vital processes before you play as they can generate a lot of FPS lagg.

[b]What is Minecraft?[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Minecraft is a sandbox building[1][2] indie video game written in Java originally by creator Markus &quot;Notch&quot; Persson and now by his company, Mojang, formed from the proceeds of the game. The game is focused on creativity and building, allowing players to build constructions out of textured cubes in a 3D world. The game is divided into two main modes – free Classic and paid Beta – where Classic is focused entirely on construction with unlimited material supply, while Beta requires players to acquire resources themselves, and contains mobs, player health, and additional features and items. The gameplay is inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper, and Infiniminer.[3][4]

The game is currently in development and Beta is the only continuously updated version of the game. Minecraft was developed for about a week before its public release on May 17, 2009 on the TIGSource forums, where it gained a considerable level of popularity. It has been continually updated and patched since then, and while it was still in alpha release, it garnered several hundred thousand sales and received critical notice and acclaim from many reviewers. It passed a million units sold on January 12, 2011,[5][6] less than a month after reaching Beta.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[size=14pt]Part 1 - Introduction[/size]

[b]Surviving your first few nights in Minecraft[/b]

Okay, before I actually explain to you how to survive there is some vital information you must know, firstly, when the sun goes down you must be in shelter, this is when the commonly referred to mobs come out. These mobs are zombies, killer spiders and what not. 

The mobs will kill you, it&#39;s what they do. They will chance you for as long as possible. The only mob which will still attack you in day light is the creeper - they explode on you and are very sneaky about it. Sometimes mobs can hide in the shade when it&#39;s day so always keep your sound on to listen out for them. When daylight comes, mobs will still spawn in dark areas such as caves, so never wonder into caves without the correct equipment or you will probably die.

[size=14pt]Part 2 - The mobs.[/size]
[anchor=part2]

[b]The mobs, what are they?[/b]

As stated above they are Zombies, they pertain of skeletons, zombies, and killer spiders. Here is a profile of each mob, every mob shown below apart from the squid is aggressive at night and some at day.

[b]Skeleton[/b]

The skeleton uses a bow and arrow as a long ranged weapon to attack its victims, this can be a deadly mob as if it&#39;s dark you simply don&#39;t know where it&#39;s shooting from. I recently had an experience in a cave with one, it wasn&#39;t pleasant. They can be identified easily as they are skeletons. Here is a picture below,

[img]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Skeleton_minecraft.png/70px-Skeleton_minecraft.png[/img]

Skeletons have a HP estimate of 7, meaning they&#39;re a pretty tough challenge. 


[b]Squids[/b]

Passive mob, they can be used to get ink which can be used to dye sheep - this can be used for carpets etc..Many people use these mobs as an attraction and they are new to 1.2+ BETA.

&lt;blockquote&gt;[ul][li]It is impossible to pull a squid onto land with a fishing rod.[/li][li]Hitting a squid underwater causes them to rise approximately 1/3 to 1/2 a block.[/li][li]Due to a bug in beta 1.2, squid can end up above water, swimming through the air (This can be done by removing the water around them with a bucket. However it occurs naturally as well).[/li][li]Squid cannot be damaged by attacking their tentacles, unlike Ghasts.[/li][li]Squid will spawn in The Nether if the necessary spawning conditions are met (using an inventory hack).[/li][li]Real squid have eight arms and two tentacles, while these have eight tentacles, making them more akin to an octopus.[/li][/ul]&lt;/blockquote&gt;


[b]Spiders[/b]

Spiders are OKAY in daylight, but when night descends evil takes them, they then turn into a mob. They are REALLY aggressive, and I am not going over the top. These little things will push you off cliffs if you&#39;re near one. They can strike when you&#39;re not paying attention. They can be identified because they look exactly like spiders! Here is a picture,

[i] Update, in newer versions of minecraft spiders now have the ability to climb walls! So always make sure you close them out/off at the top to keep the mob out![/i]

[img]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/Spider_minecraft.PNG/117px-Spider_minecraft.PNG[/img]

Spiders drop webs which can be used to make bow and arrows. Though they don&#39;t attack you in the day, if you attack them they&#39;ll still put up a fight. 

[b]Creepers[/b]

These mobs live upto there name, they creep. If you&#39;re ever unlucky enough to get the creepers stare outside your house then you&#39;ll know what I mean. But lucky, on this server you wont. Creepers where removed as they create destruction, a lot of it. If triggered they will explode destroying things around it. Though you won&#39;t need to identify them, here is a picture anyway,

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/f/fe/Twocreepers.png[/img]

I&#39;ve been unfortunate enough to have many creeper stares, my house was completely destroyed, and the surrounding area damaged beyond repair. I just found an image that pretty much sums up what I mean: 

http://www.odinseye.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/MinecraftCreeper.png



[b]Zombies[/b]

Zombies are the somewhat common ones, overused if you will. They walk with there hands out and will chase you, they can do some damage but I wouldn&#39;t worry about them too much as the mold-colored skin is quit the give away. They will burn in sunlight just like any other mob will, apart from spiders, they just return to normal. Heres a picture of a zombie,

[img]http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-JfSMgxwmPs/TL3ksP9GXVI/AAAAAAAAAA8/QT_gpA64Bww/s1600/Zombie.jpg[/img]


They, again are easily identifiable. 

[size=14pt]Part 3 - Minecraft blocks.[/size]
[anchor=part3]

Now that we have the basic mobs out the way (They are others though they have been removed from the game, or are rarely seen) we can go onto basic survival and resource hunting. In minecraft, you can destroy pretty much anything and it will turn into a block. Below is a list of things, Here is a list (Thanks to whoever made the image)

[img]http://minecraft-wiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/blocks.png[/img]


[ul][li]Mud - Found EVERYWHERE, can be used for shelter on your first few nights, though is largely ignored.[/li][li]Gold - Isn&#39;t really used for much, rings, it is pretty rare so people usually have it for the sake of it.[/li][li]Iron - Used for iron doors, pic axes, axes, flint and iron and much more. This is a very usable resource.[/li][li]Diamond - Rarely used, mostly seen as rare.[/li][li]Coal - VERY useful resource, you NEED this to survive. It can be used to create torches, heating furnaces. It keeps the mobs out in short.[/li][li]Bedrock - Cannot be mined, this means you&#39;ve hit the very bottom of what you can mine to.[/li][/ul]

Now the major blocks are out of the way, we&#39;ll move onto the major elements. Again, in that picture.


[ul][li]Lava - found when mining, be care full this stuff will kill you. It can be used for many things such as unlimited supply of rocks (Some say).[/li][li]Water - commonly used for creating pools - also for putting fire out. In advanced methods it can be used for creating mob traps and general house entrances.[/li][li]Ice - not really around much anymore, doesn&#39;t really have a use.[/li][/ul]

Now let&#39;s move on to other things.

[size=14pt]Part 4 - Actually surviving..[/size]
[anchor=part4]

[b]Actually surviving..[/b]

Okay, now you all know the basic usages and working of the minecraft world, we can move on to actually surviving. Once you log on you will spawn at a place known as the spawn area. This area is protected, so you can&#39;t get any resources from it. So simply walk away from a few minutes, then try.

Once you get to a usable area, you need to get around 20 mud (This will be a backup plan - always be sure and safe) after you&#39;ve done this, get yourself 10 - 20 lumber (wood). You can obtain lumber by cutting down trees. 

[b]How do you cut down trees?[/b]

Easy, hold your left mouse button down until you successfully get a log, keep going this until you get 10 - 20 logs, you also might want to get some tree saplings so you can plant your own trees when you are well established. Do this by cutting the trees leaves.

Now you&#39;ve got lumber, and mud you NEED to find coal, this resource will allow you to create torches which will allow you to survive. Coal is commonly found at cliff openings, and at cliff sides. Or in underground mining. Here is a few examples of where coal can be found,

[img]http://gangles.ca/images/minecraft/04_coal.jpg[/img]

That is a cliff side. Coal is a block with somewhat square spots in the middle. Specifically this:

[img]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/images/f/fb/Coalore.png[/img]

Coal only consist of around 1% of all blocks in game. This shows how much of a challenge it can be. So these are the key things you need from day 1. But you need a pic axe to mine it. We&#39;ll be using the minecraft wiki found at http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Crafting

Make a pic axe following there information.


[ul][li]Coal[/li][li]Wood[/li][li]Mud[/li][/ul]

Now that you have all of those, we&#39;ll be crafting. Firstly we need to get some sticks. How do we do this? Easy. Firstly, press &#39;i&#39; on your keyboard. It will bring up a menu which looks like this,



This is your inv, it has a small crafting space also, and your armor slots. this is only a 2x2 crafting area, which is bad. For now it&#39;ll do but we need a much bigger area later on. Now I want you to take a look at this,

http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Crafting

This will provide you with all the crafting information you&#39;ll need. We need to make torches.
Once you&#39;ve view the link and made 5-10 torches we&#39;re going to mine into where you got your coal. Create a somewhat cavern, and then put your torches up. Then cover the exit, you&#39;re now safe until the morning!

[b]can&#39;t find coal?[/b]

If you&#39;ve failed to find coal before the night, don&#39;t worry. Surround yourself in mud! Or dig yourself a hole and cover it, and try to find coal when it&#39;s morning. Also, if you&#39;re a video guy watch these:

[size=14pt]Part 5 - Tips, tricks, and other information[/size]
[anchor=part5]

I wrote this up for people who prefer reading over watching. I will probably update this. Also some useful links,


[ul][li]www.minecraft.net[/li][li]http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Minecraft_Wiki[/li][/ul]


I&#39;ll be correcting grammatical errors after I&#39;ve had some sleep. Thanks for reading and all suggestions are accepted.

[size=24pt]Minecraft - The World Map[/size]
[/center]

The official minecraft server now has a world map, it gives you the opportunity to see the entire world of Minecraft from above. This can be good for things such as tactics and navigation around the minecraft world. It comes equip with a night/day configuration which allows you to change which time you see the map in.

I personally prefer night as it shows the amazing lighting of the big cities and general monuments. You can see it here:

http://www.moparisthebest.com/worldmap/

It allows you to zoom in/out also. Please allow time for it to load once you&#39;ve done this. 


[center]
[size=24pt]Minecraft - Do/Don&#39;t[/size]
[/center]

In minecraft there is a lot of things which can go wrong, such as being griefed, flooded, etc. This will teach you how to avoid those bad things.

[b] 1) [/b] - Don&#39;t build near spawn, I mean really? The griefers will logon, and you&#39;ll be the first thing they&#39;ll see.
[b] 2) [/b] - Don&#39;t make a house next to a river, you&#39;re asking for it then.
[b] 3) [/b] - Always password protect your chests!You never know who can get into your house.
[b] 4) [/b] - Only build near a cave if you know what you&#39;re doing, this can be a bad idea as there will be A LOT of mobs.
[b] 5) [/b] - Keep time in mind, NEVER loose track of time.
[b] 6) [/b]- Don&#39;t mine directly above or below you. Gravel might fall on you and kill you or you might fall into a cavern or into lava and burn to death. (K0 Twin)
[b] 7) [/b] - Always use /sethome in your home location!
[b]Tips:[/b]
- You can only fall from 3 or less blocks/meters without taking damage.
 - Water is very handy to carry around with you, in case you accidentally touch lava
 - A compass points towards your spawn point, and is great to have while exploring, in case you get lost.

[center] [size=14pt]Minecraft commands[/size][/center]

On mine craft commands are executed by /commandhere. Here is a list of commands available to players.

[code]
/sethome - sets your home location
/home - takes you too your home location
/playerlist - shows you who is online
/help - shows help
/spawn - takes you back to the spawn area
/tell name message - PM system
/compass - A compass!
/lwc -c password PASSHERE - password protects a chest/furnace
/lwc -c private - makes a chest/furnace private
/lwc -c public - Makes a chest/furnace public
/cprivate - makes a chest/furnace private
/cpublic - makes a chest/furnace public
/cpassword [password] - makes a chest/furnace password protected
[/code]

[center] [size=24pt]Mini-Guides[/size] [/center]

Alright, in this section I&#39;m going to be writing advanced/beginner guides which will come in handy to you in your minecraft experience. They won&#39;t be really long as this guide is pretty big already.

[b]Quick Situation[/b]

If you&#39;re on a long trip to another place in minecraft, you will find yourself traveling for days sometimes. So you&#39;re going to have to spend the night away from the safety of your local community and home - I like to keep traveling for as long as possible then dig a 2x2 hole and fill in the top. This means no mobs can get you and it takes literally 4 seconds to do meaning more travel time and less messing around! It also requires no torches so is good if you&#39;re in pretty much any situation. 

[b]A mob cave [/b]

I&#39;ve recently stumbled upon a mob cave on the server. I can tell you now, I was happy. I found coal, iron, diamond, lava, the lot! But it came with a  risk, mobs. The way I like to clear a mob cave is simple - peacefully. Sure you could go in there with weapons and risk a death or more mobs but I feel my method is better. I take 60 torches, 60 blocks of dirt and a few pic axes and head down. I make a 2x2 gap to ensure the start is clear of mobs and then light it up. I then block the opening of the next part of the cave with dirt to ensure no other mobs try to attack me while I light the current segment of the cave I&#39;m in up. Once I&#39;ve lit it up and mined all the resources in that segment I check the next and do the same - This ensures you cannot be ambushed or long ranged by mobs while you&#39;re mining valuable resources.

If you happen to see a mobster you simply put blocks to create a wall and go around it. Or you could use the wall to your advantage and kill it. This creates a much safer environment for cleaning out a mob cave. 

[b] Grow your own wood [/b]

Really! I&#39;m sick of having to risk it ever morning incase a zombie is hiding in the shade. Just grow your own. You have a roof, right? Put dirt on it plant some saplings and you can even cut them at night - it&#39;s much more safer and makes your house seem all in one. 

[size=18pt]FPS and lagg[/size]

Many people complain of lagg on many minecraft servers, mainly FPS lagg. The best you can do to try and combat these laggs are to end all non vital processes and make an attempt to rid your PC of unwanted junk and trouble causing programs.

[center][size=24pt]Minecraft server software[/size][/center]

I was going to write my own tutorial for this, but I feel that this tutorial is better, and comes with full detail.

It goes over setting up Java to potential errors and FAQs.

Might want to add charcoal in as you seem to have missed it. Also, you say pic axe multiple times but I’m sure it’s pickaxe. Also add pictures for basic recipes like pickaxes, shovels and furnaces.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ve wanted to continue adding to the second post for a while, I just never got around to it as I’ve had a Business Studies thing on, that ended today. Thanks for the suggestion as well I’ll add those and correct and potential errors.</p>
<p>Now to find suitable images to improve it further.</p>
