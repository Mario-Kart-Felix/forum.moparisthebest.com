    <title>What to do with extra computer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-to-do-with-extra-computer/325180</link>
    <description>I currently use it for botting, but I&#39;d rather do something else with it. I was thinking of maybe setting up a simple web-server on it considering my ISP doesn&#39;t block port 80. I would set it up with Fedora (or CentOS) and lighttpd. But, I need some ideas, thoughts?

Edit: Specs
Intel Pentium 4 Processor @ 1.6GHz
1G DDR Ram

So it couldn&#39;t handle something too ridiculous.</description>

It would be for local testing most likely, then again I could just run WAMP as normal like I currently do. But your movie idea is a good one too.</p>
