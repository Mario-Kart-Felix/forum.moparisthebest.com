    <description>Hi guys,

I was thinking, if I do fail or end up being totally incompetent in making my own script to do the following, would anyone be able to do it?
The script would be used to find a match in the image from a database of images. What do I mean?

For example, I would have a cropped portion of a particular image, and I have to find out what that particular image is.
So I would run the script to find out what this image is by running through a database of images, seeing if that particular &#39;mystery&#39; image is in the database.

Would anyone be able to do something like that? Or at least, guide me along in completing this script?
Thanks so much in advance. Cheers!</description>
