    <title>Should I get back in the RSPS game?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-i-get-back-in-the-rsps-game/403687</link>
    <description>You can skip the first three paragraphs: I started RSPS&#39;s back in 2006, I was very inexperienced, i t4lk3d l1ek th1s, and I thought I was the best programmer in the world for knowing HTML. I was immature, and I didn&#39;t know fuck about programming.

I came back fully in late 2009/early 2010 and I joined SoulSplit, which I am sure many of you are familiar with. I rose through the ranks and I ended up co-owner for a bit. Shit happened and I quit. I joined again with SoulSplit reborn in late 2010, and I quit again. Now I am back, looking to start my own server. I started one a while back, it was a success for a few months then I stopped getting donations and I couldn&#39;t pay for the VPS or website hosting. 

I now have the time, energy, and resources to devote myself full time to a server. I have actual experience with Java (non-rsps experience), after having spent months reading and learning the language. I have an actual formal education in the language, and I&#39;m ready to start again.

Stop skipping now.

Okay, so, here&#39;s what I want from you guys. What is new with RSPS&#39;s? What source should I work on? I&#39;m hoping that Project Insanity is still popular, since I spent most of my RSPS time on that source. I&#39;m not going to be writing my code based off of a shitty source like OmfgfmgmfgmmPkzScape, I&#39;m going to base it off of clean Project Insanity. It has enough framework down for it to be a useable source, and very little extra crappy features to remove (saving time).

Are there still a lot of dupes out there? I remember that duping was a huge problem when I was here last, and I want to know if its worth it to invest in a server that will be overrun by dupes.

tl;dr What sources are the most popular now and good to work off of, and is duping still a big problem?

I would appreciate responses, but if you don&#39;t want to, thats fine.

Thanks.</description>

<p>Duping is barely a problem on Project Insanity, and PI is popular, because it’s easy to code and understand.  The most popular sources so far are ErasedPkz, DSPK, and FormationX.  But PI isn’t that stable. and yes hyperion is a packaged source.</p>

<p>Thanks. I’m not going to be basing my source off of the popular sources you listed, I’ll be doing it off of vanilla PI.</p>
<p>Thanks for the information.</p>
