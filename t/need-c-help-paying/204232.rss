    <description>Hey guys,

Basically I run a game server for a game called helbreath. The server is written in C/C++. The server runs on 4 server files.  GateServer, GameServer, MainLogin Server and World Server.

Basically I am receiving attacks from another computer that is connecting his World Server to my mainlogin server which results in it crashing.

Example

Now what I was going to ask guys, is there a code that someone can write that will not accept anymore World Server Connections to my main login?

There is server source. Any recommendations or code would be great. Thanks

If you want payment then give me your paypal.</description>

              <p>How about you only allow your server IP to connect to your mainlogin server? There are a million firewalls out there that could handle this for you.</p>
