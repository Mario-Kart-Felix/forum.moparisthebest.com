    <title>Squeak/ring</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/squeak-ring/257651</link>
    <description>My computer sometimes gives off a squeak/ringing noise on the inside.  It is usually triggered by weird things.  

Once the squeak would happen everytime i scrolled through a pdf but now its gone

the ringing happened today when I played a youtube video.

does anyone know what could be wrong?  I think it is probably some fan.</description>
