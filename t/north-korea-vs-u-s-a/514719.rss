<p>True we earn a lot of money from oil and gas. That is because the government own (The majority of the shares) the biggest oil company in Norway, and the oil companies here must pay 78% in taxes. How much does American oil companies pay?</p>
<p>If you want to make money on planes, you have to build them yourself and sell them. You can’t just buy them from a private company and hope you can sell them for more money.</p>

Just to have them. You put a bunch of people to work for years to get them built and you also keep your military supply up. Not only that but we can then sell them to other countries. Prevent people from dying? It must be nice that Norway can export all those natural resources to pay for it.</p>
<p>I forgot what the 4 were jme, it was like defense, foreign policy, commerce or something and then there was one other one but it wasn’t the postal service lol (but that may have been included within one of the 4)</p>

<p>What they need to do is move social security and the other federally funded entitlement programs to the STATE level to free up the federal budget.

<p>By your logic, 1/4 of the budget should go towards running a postal service? (unless it already is, in which case &gt;.&gt;)</p>
<p>It’s not that I disagree with you. Because how you describe it is almost identical to Canada. All social programs like Education, Healthcare, and Welfare are the responsibility of the provinces. That being said, these programs do receive money from the federal government, but are funded mainly by provincial taxes.</p>

They keep cutting emergency workers pay back. I mean the town I lived in had to “merge” 2 firestations together, because it was costing too much money. As well they laid off 5 firefighters. They also don’t get paid the amount they should for what they do to help the people in the country.</p>

The military creates way more jobs than social welfare ever will.  But yes people need it, but neither party is willing to fix the holes in it so it continues to be the biggest black hole of our spending.</p>

<p>A lot of people hate America because of how ignorant most Americans are… We don’t keep everything in the world from crashing, which should be a given obvious, because there are still a lot of places that are in still victimized due to corruption, mainly due because we have no right or reasoning to interfere. America’s biggest problem is that we always have to invade every other country’s privacy.</p>
<p>I’m sure that it is quite clear to everyone that America is a strong nation, but it surely isn’t the same nation it was years ago.</p>
