    <title>Book Reviews</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/book-reviews/9341</link>
    <description>Well basically one of my things at school for english is that i have to read 9 books in 3 terms and write book reviews on them.   So we are halfway through term 3 and i have only written two.  :eek: Me = Procrastinator and i cant really be bothered reading all those books. So either 

1. Anyone got any book reviews that they had to do for class. If you do make sure you have criteria below

2. Anysites where i could get book reviews. Yes i have googled but they dont fit the criteria below.

Criteria

Basically a little abotu the plot but not much. Has to be hand written to atleast half a page. AND the most important thing is that it needs to have two personalised responses.  e.g i liked this character because........ i disliked the ending because.......... just basically somethign you liked or disliked abotu the book but not the plot. e.g beginning, end, the use of language features, characters, themes etc.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Btw if your posting a old book review that you wrote. Make sure the boook can be bought inside New Zealand so they cant accuse me of cheating.</description>
