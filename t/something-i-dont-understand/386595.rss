    <description>Well in the General Programming section all of my games I have been creating keep being deleted just because they are made using GML. But under the topic it says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;General Programming 
A place to discuss programming, [b]regardless of language choice[/b], that isn&#39;t related to private server development.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If its regardless of choice, why are they deleted?</description>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> The only work that game maker actually does for you is organize. It keeps everything seperated and it allowes you to give the object the proper sprite/background/sound instead of haveing to code that yourself. Otherwise everything is up to you.</p>

              <p>As for the whole scripting language argument, things like Ruby, Python and Lua are generally considered as scripting languages but would still be acceptable in this section. Also, the other argument about it doing the work for you is a poor one. A higher level application written in Java with its graphics APIs is really doing a lot of the lower-level work for you as well.</p>
<p>Anyway, if the games the OP has been making aren’t suitable for the programming section I’m sure he would/should still be allowed to post them in general discussion since that contains everything else that doesn’t break the rules, and I’m certain that using something like Game Maker isn’t against the overall forum rules.</p>

<p>But in the opinion of moparscape staff its still scripting, accept it and be done.</p>

              <p>Its in the stickies, the exception to being allowed is scriping, or not using your own code (a game engine thats not your is allowed). Sure, gact GML is giving you the engine is fine, but issue is, its scripting, not programmig.</p>

              <p>Well in the General Programming section all of my games I have been creating keep being deleted just because they are made using GML. But under the topic it says:</p>

<p>If its regardless of choice, why are they deleted?</p>
