    <title>Error when running the server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-when-running-the-server/429772</link>
    <description>Hello guys,

I kinda made this topic cause I somehow was not getting any replies at my previous one, The topic somehow dies when you&#39;re not on the first page... And i couldnt double post or bump or whatever.. so yea..

I just want to be able to play this private server I found at the Downloads page.. Please take a look at the topic I made to be able to understand the whole situation cause you would&#39;nt understand If i typed down everything right here.

Link to previous topic: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,531828.0.html

Take a look at the error at the bottom of the page, please. Any help on this is highly appreciated.

Oh, and if I shouldn&#39;t have made this topic/ there&#39;s a &quot;better&quot; way of getting help with this, sorry.</description>
