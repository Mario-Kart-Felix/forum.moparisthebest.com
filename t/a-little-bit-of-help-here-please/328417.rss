    <description>Alright guys, I&#39;m trying to make a server here. Let me just start of by saying I&#39;m using Windows 7 Ultimate.
So I downloaded No-Ip DUC and made an account and named my server. Under these settings:
[img]http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/273d6dc2a3.jpg[/img]
And I downloaded ~UniversalScape~ source. This source works great whenever I run the server and go on silabsoft and play without entering a server name. But obviously it doesn&#39;t get anymore boring than playing by yourself. I&#39;m making this server to play with friends and stuff.
By the way, I have done all the &quot;CLASSPATH&quot; and &quot;PATH&quot; stuff.
So now I open the no-ip DUC and then run the server. Whenever I try logging in I get the infamous &quot;Cannot connect to server&quot;. I think this is a port forwarding problem. I have a bell modem that is also a router. Whenever I open my CMD and type &quot;ipconfig&quot; it gives me &quot;&#39;ipconfig&#39; is not regognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file&quot;. So instead I go to Control Pannel &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Change adapter settings &gt; Local Area Connection &gt; Details and then copy the IPv4 Default Gateway to my internet browser. I then get this:

So I click on &quot;Application Support&quot; and it brings me here:

[img]http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/1906/66034577.jpg[/img]

So I added RsPrivateServer by going to &quot;Enable Application Support&quot; (look in the tabs) and then I get this:

I have two John-PC, I&#39;m not sure why (witch is the computer I want the server on, and the one I use). The first john-PC is at &quot;maximum protection&quot; setting. And when i click the second john-PC, it&#39;s like this:
[IMG]http://img229.imageshack.us/img229/9396/25818741.jpg[/img]

Now at this point, I know everyone is confused about what is RsPrivateServer.
I clicked on &quot;Add a new user-defined application&quot;:
[IMG]http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/2981/62131099.jpg[/img]
And it brought me to this page:
[IMG]http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/3145/44448253.jpg[/img]
And I typed the above, and then I assigned it to John-PC. So now I go on silabsoft, but it still gives me the &quot;Error connection to server&quot;. So I put it in the second John-PC and still nothing.
Am I doing to the right thing?
I have been working on this for the past 1-2 hours and still haven&#39;t found anything. If someone can help, it would be a big relief.</description>

<p>My friend is still not able to log in with the no-ip. (It’s <a href="http://servegame.com" rel="nofollow noopener">servegame.com</a>, btw)</p>
<p>EDIT: I found out why I have two John-PC. It’s because I have to computer named after that. So I renamed this computer to John-Desktop (the second John-PC). I still have the “Error Connection to server though!”</p>
<p>EDIT: I think I fixed my port forwarding problem. If i go to <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> and type the port, it is able to see it. However, I still get the “error connecting to server”.</p>
