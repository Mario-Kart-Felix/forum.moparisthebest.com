          <blockquote>
              <p>I didn’t bother reading all of it, just the table that is mentioned in the article. The $16 trillion claimed to be given to the banks are divided among 6 programs. 2 of those programs account for over $10 trillion, so I’ll just quote what they are:</p>
<p>TAF total: $3,818 billion </p><blockquote>Auctioned one-month and three-month discount window loans to eligible depository institutions</blockquote> Current balance: $0 Interest rate: 4,17% to 4,65%.
<p>PDCF total: $8,951 billion. </p><blockquote>Provided overnight cash loans to primary dealers against eligible collateral<br>
[…] For example, an overnight PDCF loan of $10 billion that was renewed daily at the same level for 30 business days would result in an aggregate amount borrowed of $300 billion although the institution, in effect, borrowed only $10 billion over 30 days.</blockquote> Current balance: $0
<p>Two quotes from the article:</p>
<blockquote>$16,000,000,000,000.00 had been secretly given out to US banks and corporations and foreign banks everywhere from France to Scotland.</blockquote>
Secretly given? The programs were announced, and were done in cooperation with the Bank of England, Canada Switzerland and the ECB. The FED even sent out press releases about these programs. So it wasn't secretly.
<blockquote>The Federal Reserve likes to refer to these secret bailouts as an all-inclusive loan program, but virtually none of the money has been returned and it was loaned out at 0% interest.</blockquote>
<p>None of the money has been returned? Completely false! The Audit report clearly shows that the balances are currently $0 which means that either the loans have been payed back or they have been written off. According to the FED, they have been repaid: </p><blockquote>The facility was announced on March 16, 2008, and was closed on February 1, 2010. All loans extended under this facility were repaid in full, with interest, in accordance with the terms of the facility.</blockquote>
<p>Second statement of that quote is that it was loaned out at 0% interest. The average interest rate of the PDCF program was 1,5%. Hardly 0%. The PDFC program was by far the biggest, and the duration was only one day. The offered collateral was 108% of the loan.</p>
<p>All in all, the author(s) of this article have some explaining to do.</p>

<p>Actually it’s because it’s a load of tosh and bollocks but believe what you want, how many of you actually looked at the source the article was using?</p>
<p>The loans were mostly short term overnight loads - paid back the following day by the institutions. A lot of them renewed them in consecutive days, so if a bank borrowed $10B a day for 100 days that would be 1 trillion, but it was also paid back on each consecutive day, so the figures are massively misleading and wrong.</p>
<p>I’m all up for bashing America but atl east get your facts straight ;D</p>
