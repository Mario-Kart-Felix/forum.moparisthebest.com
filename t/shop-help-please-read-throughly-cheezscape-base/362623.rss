    <description>Ok, so my shops are messed up. I can connect to them and buy items from them but i can not sell any items to them. Also...the only way to get money on my server atm is to spawn it in the character files. Then when you use that money it can be used normally. but when you bank it and then try to get it out again it doesnt come. it comes by 1&#39;s. so when you have a full inventory you only have 20 some coins. i would like to fix both of these problems</description>
