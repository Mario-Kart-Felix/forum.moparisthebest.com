[b]Introduction[/b]:
We lead the industry with innovative ideas. Offering full production-build support and code written by top programming masterminds, for free in one small package.

[b]Logic[/b]:
RubyRS was designed in simplicity. Combining simple design with authentic code, we take advantage of all technologies available - researching each and every line, to make sure the conclusion is the most efficient.

[b]Support[/b]:
Each production-build of RubyRS includes top of the line customer support. 
Full setup tutorials, full code-documentation, along with useful comments help you solve problems on your own.
If you have insufficient of what we mean by the phrase &#39;code-documentation&#39; this means basically commenting above
each method, what it does.

[b]Plugin(s):[/b]
Each plugin has hooks that can be activated by overriding the 
abstract method found in the Plugin class. Upon actions, the abstract methods inside the plugin extension (the actual plugin content) is activated using the information from the arguments provided within the abstract method the plugin content has overridden.

[b]Community[/b]:
Our own community allows developers to post plugins, 
updates, content bonuses, and of course hands-on help from other members.

[b]Package[/b]:
Lightweight production style and libraries make our server framework, well, lightweight. Topping 4mb, our framework is 
by far a small package with a powerful punch. Containing soon-to-be content that could possibly blow a developer&#39;s mind away.

[b]How to contact or talk with us[/b]:

<p>Read-ability is a strong factor for me when it comes to source code design. Theres been loads of frameworks and sources that come out and are NEVER USED WIDELY, almost entirely because the average person does not understand what a file does, nor what goes in which file, because its too confusing. Breaking it down to an easier to understand setup before you even get started might be beneficial in the long run.</p>

</aside>
<p>Who said anything about releasing? None of the communities around here give a shit anyway.<br>
Besides this isn’t my project, anonymous developer, not saying his name I just posted thread for him.</p>
