    <description>Hi, 

I just downloaded Allstar-scape V2 and set up no-ip with a server called &#39;Screechscape.no-ip.biz&#39;. Now, I configured my router and everything and allowed a port through my firewall called Screechscape.no-ip.biz. I renamed everything in Client&#39;java to my server&#39;s name. Then on the No-IP website, I set up my server and used the ip it says to use up in the corner of it. I also set up the downloaded no-ip thing. I opened up a Runserver. I&#39;m using jdk1.6.0_06 and jre1.6.0_06. i need some help here, because when I get to the register page, it says &#39;The server ScreechScape.no-ip.biz is offline, it must be online before you can register it here.&#39; I used the Name of the server. this is what I did:

Name:  SCREECHSCAPE.NO-IP.BIZ
IP:  THE IP NO-IP GAVE ME
Port:  43594
Password (to edit info):  MY PASSWORD
Re-type Password:  MYP PASSWORD

Then, I tried to get it on with a runserver open. Nothing happened..

Hopefully, someone can help me. Please don&#39;t flame and leave rude comments, I am not a noob at this, I have basic knowledge. I have had one before, but it went down.
