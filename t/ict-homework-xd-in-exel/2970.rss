    <description>right i am doing the ict gnvq course and i need to do a spreadsheet in exel but i dont know how to put drop down bars on it and how to make it so that when you select the item in the drop down bar it inserts a number into a diffrent cell.

so say like i was making one for a resturant and was selling drinks in the drop down bar for drink it would be wine, coke ect so you select the drink and it puts the price into the cell next to it. hope it makes sense thanks for reading  ;)[br][size=1]Posted at: May 15, 2006, 03:43:03 pm[/size][hr]i woulda fought this would be easy seing as this is a forum about ict things :P or does what i asked not make sense?</description>

<p>I had one of those but was told it wouldnt increase my mark because its excel not databasing. Next year when our coursework is databasing we are to use it.</p>

<p>Next part is tricky.  You can either use VBA code to determine the value of the combobox and print a price value in a different cell, or you can create an intricate conditional function in a cell.  I’m not very experienced with vba or managing forms in excel, so I would look in your book to see how they manipulate form elements.</p>

              <p>Do you mean a dropdown bar when working with forms and vba in excel?</p>
<p>I haven’t done this kind of stuff in excel for a while, but I think when you create the combo box, and select the input range (which will give the values in the dropdown box), you need to load up the vba editor to give it the necessary code.  Now, I don’t know if there’s an easier way, but I would obtain the selected value/index of the combo box and determine through the vba code in your subroutine what to input in a specific cell, which would be like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Range("A1").Select
Selection.Value = 1.99</code></pre>
<p>Or something…hope that help at least a bit.</p>
