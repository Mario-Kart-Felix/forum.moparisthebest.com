    <title>Help Me Host on RSWebclients, It Loads the Game for 2 Seconds then Disconnects</title>

    <description>Ok, I run my server from computer, I&#39;ve portforwarded and all. The client fully loads, then asks for user name and password. I put it in, and it loads into the game for 2 seconds then quits? WHY!!????


1. I have port-forwarded the port.

2. I tried it with disabled firewall.

3. Tried it with another totally different 317. (BlankScape) Same Problem

4. My Server Client has the No-Ip and it loads the cache and everything perfectly in RSWebclients, and there seems to be no issue with the server, but the webclient just quits after 2 seconds.

what might be the issue? what might I need to edit?

it won&#39;t load for you because my server might not be running. It fully loads only when my Server Batch file is initiated.</description>
