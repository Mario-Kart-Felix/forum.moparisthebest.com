    <description>[center]Hello and thanks for viewing this thread.

I am posting about a problem i have and i dont seem to be able to find the solution. I am using the Matrix 667 Source (RsCalifornia) and i made a vital mistake. I changed the combat formula or something and messed it all up. now the server works, compiles and everything, but for example, i did ::master and im combat 85, people are starting new accounts at combat 200+ instead of combat 3. I beleive this is in PlayerCombat.java but im not sure. If someone could hand me a snippet of what im looking to change i would appreciate it so much. Thanks alot.

To help me with this problem just post below or add my skype, ill be checking both regularly, thanks again.
