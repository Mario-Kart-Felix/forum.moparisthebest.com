    <description>MTP V2 was a very popular server that I hosted and released. 
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,457959.msg3351330.html#msg3351330 It has reached thousands of downloads and I hosted it with 100+ always on. The main feature was pking and thieving at stalls, nothing else! I hope with some additions I will be able to get back to 100+ always on and more!

The goal of MTP is to be a popular pking server where you can join and start pking within minutes. All you have to do is buy your gear from the shops. Some skills have been added and I hope to add more features than just pking. The pking on this server is some of the best you will see.

Things Recently Added:
-Full screen Client (webclient too, and you can use resized if you don&#39;t want full screen)
-Korasi (with spec) and dragon defender
-Fixed godswords

Skills Recently Added:
-Mining
-Woodcutting (Mining and woodcutting aren&#39;t 100%)
-Agility
-Crafting

Some of my ideas I hope to do Soon:
-New Prayers
-Dungeoneering Minigame
-Npc minigame where you get points per kill and can then spend the points in a shop.


Anyone can become a part of the development team. Only a few people will be selected to be coders or designers. Everyone is welcome to be a Beta Tester of some of the new pking. I will be hosting this 24/7 off a Vps and I&#39;ll be coding everything I can. I&#39;m not an expert and I hope I can get some coders that are a lot better than me (I&#39;m not very good anyway.) 

[b]New[/b]: People who can recruit several active players will be given donator or superdonator, depending on how many people you get. Anyone who increases our player population should 100% be rewarded.

Add me on msn: Marcbobishere@hotmail.com - Even if you don&#39;t want to join the team but maybe can help out with a couple things when I need some help

If you want to apply for a position other than beta tester fill this application out:
1. What are you best at doing (Coding, gfx, website, or other)?
2. Are you active?
3. Are you apart of more than one server?
4. Can you contribute new things and features?
5. How can I contact you? (I only use skype and msn so post one of those if you have.)


I&#39;m not working with Rash &amp; Runefx. This server is going to be a world 2/pking server for his. He is a really good coder and I hope he will help me out with a lot of things.</description>
