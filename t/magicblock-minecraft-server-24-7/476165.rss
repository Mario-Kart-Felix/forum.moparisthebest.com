Server IP: 94.23.0.28:25653




We currently have ONLY one server set up and running which include the Survival, PvP, and Hunger Games and already THEwalls.


Survival Server
The survival servers main objective is to play the game how it is meant to be played. The server has 1 worlds where players build by themselves or with friends. We also have out own custom protection system.

HUNGER games: lots of fun, where only one can win, team or player, restarted all the times, and random chests… So no need to worried.

The walls: the classic one, until the 3 be ready.. Loots of fun, where you can team up with your friend, and be the only standing in the game. 



Soon: 
FreeBuild Server
The Creative server allows players to claim plots and build by either them self or with friends! All items will be hadded to the market so no work needs to go into obtaining items - giving easy access to create outstanding builds!

Shop´s system, jail system, DROOP party every week..

Installed pluguins: 

AntiGrief, dynmap, GriefPrevention, 

MCFly, mcMMO, StarterKit, Vote4Diamondz, WorldEdit and some more fun .</description>
