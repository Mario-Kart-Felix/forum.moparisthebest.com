That comes up when i boot up my laptop, win 7 toshiba. And it just repeats that message over and over. That happened after i used DBAN (dariks boot and nuke). A buddy of mine downloaded windows on a cd and when i try to boot that cd at startup, same thing happens in the picture, help please. Any ideas at all?</description>

              <p>The problem is it’s trying to boot from the network, which is why you are still getting the same error regardless of whether a CD is inserted or not, didn’t have to use DBAN, all was needed was a simple boot sequence modification.  Have to change it to boot from disc, now that you’ve nuked your OS…</p>
