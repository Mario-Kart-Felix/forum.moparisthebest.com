    <description>It&#39;s simple.

[b]EAT[/b]

An example diet would be chocolate for dinner, drink chocolate or saturated fats mixed with oil as preferred beverage. Try to eat as much as you can before puking, and if you do happen to puke, pour some chocolate sauce over it and eat again! Try to eat as much as possible at all moments, and do NOT move EVER. Just sit around in front of #mopar and enjoy yourself.

If you do this successfully you might even reach io9&#39;s level one day!

EDIT: Someone request proof and here it is! (Me, i started 3 weeks ago)
