    <description>I know how to do a lot with a private server but there is one thing that has always stumped me.. People like to exploit the in-game action timers by loggin out then back in. I tried numerous times to fix this and failed each time. I guess what i want is to have my server save the action timer with the person&#39;s character file so that they can&#39;t exploit it. If you can help thanks!

I would also like something like this for the special attack bar too. Just saying...</description>
