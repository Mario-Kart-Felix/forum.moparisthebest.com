    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-brand-new-to-server-coding-and-all-that-stuff/447704</link>
    <description>Okay, i downloaded an Allstarscape v2 source, yes i know, its a 317 and all that stuff and its glitchy. But ive always loved allstar cause it was sooooooo much fun (: anyways, i downloaded a course, buuut it never came with a client. I wanna run my server offline for awhile, while i add stuff and make everything look cool! I need a client for it that wont give me any nulls or anything. And if i do get a client, how do i like, connect it to my server while still being offline. I know this might be nooby question and it might have already been answered on another thread, but i just want someone to help my personal thread. Thank you everyone! (:</description>
