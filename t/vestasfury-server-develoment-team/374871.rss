    <description>Hey all, this is an organization started to form the famous pker Jiglojay&#39;s &quot;Jigloscape&quot;.  Some might not know who he is, but i garuntee if you look him up on youtube you will know why.

I(Visavis) have gotten permission from Jiglojay himself to start this task, and I am head of the team.  I need a staff though, and this is my first place to start.  We have gotten a few people that would like to apply already, but many more are welcome.  If you think you have what it takes just reply down here or send us an email on facebook at VestasFury or also at Visavis911@yahoo.com.

Because of our accomplishments that involves creating servers before, having a massive Clan on the regular runescape a while ago where we first formed, and getting a big community we sometimes call ourselves a company, even though its not &quot;official&quot;

Hopefully theres enough people that would like to be apart of this big task ordered by jig, so apply immediately :)

Thanks all!
