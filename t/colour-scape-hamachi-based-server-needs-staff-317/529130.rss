    <title>Colour-Scape (Hamachi Based Server) Needs Staff 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/colour-scape-hamachi-based-server-needs-staff-317/529130</link>
    <description>Hello everyone today i am here to advertise my server, although this is not the specific topic for this i am going to declare it now -my server is hamachi based as when i try to portforward it says the port 43594 is closed. If anyone can help me with that it would be much appreciated.

Yes the server needs staff!

However to the advertisement;

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/wxvaoti.png[/img] Fully working admin control panel!

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Z8tZjln.png[/img] Fully working desktop client! With snow effects!

[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/Rv8Xk6u.png[/img] Newly added, custom thieving/selling zone.

Yes the server is in need of donations too, as when i am able to portforward, i will switch straight to a VPS/.Jar client.

The forums can be found here --&gt;  http://www.colourscape.enjin.com/

The desktop client can be downloaded here --&gt; http://www.filedropper.com/colour-scapeclient 

And finally to gain access to the server you will need to join one of the following hamachi networks;

Colour-scape
Colour-scape(1)
Colour-scape(2)
Colour-scape(3)

All passwords for the networks are 123.

Thanks for taking time in this post, i hope to see you in-game!
