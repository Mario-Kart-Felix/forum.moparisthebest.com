    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/character-logout-timer/359059</link>
    <description>so title explains it mostly, im trying to change the logout timer. if i go idle for about 45 seconds or maybe even 30 it logs me out. its quite annoying, and i&#39;d like to make it longer. i went to a file searcher with my source im using, and typed logout, but nothing came up with numbers that looked right. any ideas where to look? thanks. im going to keep looking and ill check back soon.

Edit: i keep looking but i cant find anything. help please? :\

im using a demisepking source and client if that helps.</description>
