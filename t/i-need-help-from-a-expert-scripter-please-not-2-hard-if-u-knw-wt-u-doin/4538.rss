    <description>ok here it is. i been trying for ages to get a decent powerminer and powerWCer and i found a good powerWCer. it was 1 of the free ones that starblaster100 was giving links to.

i started it and it was great but when it came to a progress report it didnt seem to work... i knew that i had chopped like 20 logs but it said i hadnt chooped any. now normally i wudnt worry bout a small feature like that getting in my way but i believe its part of the bigger problem. which is when i get full inventory i DOESNT drop the logs! it just keeps trying to cut more trees and i end up having to pause the sript and manually dropping the logs which defeats the whole point of cheating runescape.
now i am not that good at cheating runescape and using SCAR and scripts 

so please help me

also if any1 has a script just like starblaster100s then please pm me link or tell me script or somthin (it cant include SRL tho becoz when using SRL it doesnt work somthing to do with &#39;processpicture&#39;.

im so sorry bout this long post but as u can see i am totally and utterly CLUELESS

thanks so much[br][size=1]Posted at: July 08, 2006, 06:46:29 PM[/size][hr]please dont just view thing help me i need it soo badly

              <p>Okay, you can’t use SRL because you didn’t install it right <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Make sure you put all of the .dll’s in the ‘place in side plugins folder’, inside the plugins folder. If that doesn’t work…oh well, I guess it just doesn’t wanna work. And I’ll fix the script if you like, just upload it here.</p>
