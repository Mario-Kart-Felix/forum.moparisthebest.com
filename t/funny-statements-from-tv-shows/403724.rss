    <description>Here is one from George lopez thought it was pretty funny :D

[code]00:21:10	Hello?
00:21:15	Marlene&#39;s gone, and so am i.
00:21:16	Oh, no, you&#39;re not going anywhere until you say something nice about my life.
00:21:20	George, don&#39;t be stupid.
00:21:22	Mom, I can wait.
00:21:22	You, on the other hand, need a smoke in about three minutes.
00:21:26	I&#39;m not gonna do it.
00:21:26	Why not?
00:21:27	Would it kill you to say something nice about me for once?
00:21:30	No!
00:21:33	Say something nice.
00:21:33	No!
00:21:34	Say it!
00:21:35	No!
00:21:36	!
00:21:37	Because if I do, it&#39;ll go away!
00:21:39	What are you talking about, you crazy old bat?
00:21:44	You are not supposed to brag about things.
00:21:47	If you do, the evil eye will take it away.
00:21:51	You know --mal de ojo.
00:21:56	Okay, let&#39;s try this again.
00:21:57	What are you talking about, you crazy old bat?
00:22:02	I am not crazy.
00:22:03	Why do you think I rubbed pee on your face !
00:22:13	Mom, that&#39;s unsanitary!
00:22:16	You know, your aunts kept saying how cute you were, and so I had to go and get some ugly to rub on your face.
00:22:25	You know, so that the evil eye would pass over you.
00:22:28	So I took a little pee from the diaper -- that was the ugly -- you know, now that I look back at it, I probably put a little too much on.
00:22:42	Well, now that you say it like that, it makes perfect sense.
00:22:46	I better go wake up my adorable son and smear him with his own waste!
00:22:49	You know, to protect him from the evil eye.
00:22:52	Shut up, george, shut up!
00:22:54	Shh!
00:22:56	It can hear you.
00:22:57	With what, mom -- its evil ears?
00:23:00	You don&#39;t get it, do you?
00:23:03	Almost everything good in my life&#39;s been taken away.
00:23:07	You don&#39;t play with this.
00:23:08	That&#39;s why you don&#39;t compliment me?
00:23:11	Wait a second -- then why were you complimenting randy?
00:23:14	If something happens to randy, that&#39;s bad.
00:23:17	If something ..
00:23:28	Thank you.
00:23:29	That&#39;s all I ever wanted.
00:23:34	YOU KNOW WHAT? [ Sighs] You&#39;re really a good mom.
00:23:41	Come and get her, eye.
00:23:42	George! you know what?
00:23:43	That&#39;s not funny.
00:23:44	Mom, you&#39;re a good person, and you should live forever.
00:23:45	Okay?andale.
00:23:48	Come on, eye!
00:23:48	I&#39;m gonna get you!
00:23:49	Wait, we&#39;re going in the backyard!
00:23:50	[ Speaking Spanish ] VÁmanos!eye, let&#39;s go!

Here’s something from Daniel Tosh:</p>
<p>I always wondered if those WWJD(What would Jesus do) bracelets worked, so I bought one the other day. Does everybody have their WWJD bracelets on? 'Cause I was wearing my bracelet recently, and I was in the movie theater, and this guys cell phone went off – don’t you just hate that? Then he picked it up, “Hey, how’s it going? I’m in a movie.” And so I say…and I’m not going to censor myself here “Hey buddy, Get off the phone please!” And he’s like, “Mind your own business asshole.” Oh, now there is trouble in River City. I’m a man, not much of one, but a man, and I will choke you if you are smaller, younger, and preferably white. So I reach over the seat, and at that moment I see my bracelet: What Would Jesus Do? So I lit him on fire and sent him to Hell.</p>
<p>That was back from 03.[/quote]<br>
He did some great stand up specials, shows kinda iffy at times but ehh it’s pretty good too.</p>
