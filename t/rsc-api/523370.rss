    <title>Rsc api</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsc-api/523370</link>
    <description>I believe the original idea came from Object/Jorgen and our long talk on &#39;SoC&#39;. The idea is to have an API containing all rsc data. This way people who are creating their own frameworks can easily have the data available with a simple plugin. I have already started this project and used ents catalyst server as an example since it&#39;s pretty bare. (Just proof of concept, I wouldn&#39;t be using that base anyways)

I would like to have some sort of feedback on what you guys would like to see? If anyone else is interested we can make it a community project and post it on github.</description>

I must have sent the position update message, but just discarded sending the position update bits for the surrounding players. Because all of them disappeared. So any player currently known to the client will be removed whether you send the remove bits or discard sending the position update bits for said player entirely.</p>

              <p>The position updates don’t need to come every cycle, you can actually have them at larger intervals. I was messing around with adding slow/bind spells, and did this, and it worked perfectly fine. The only weird thing is that when you walk and stand at a tile for a bit, but you can do that by adjusting the animation speeds and such to match (it’s actually pretty easy to get it to work right based on the player’s “speed”).</p>

              <p>CodeForFame is right, the loop sleep time can be arbitrary so long as position updates are kept roughly 600ms apart.<br>
What you should be doing, and what I believe I did in Elysium, is using a priority queue for absolutely everything. The priority queue is ordered such that the next task that you get from it with peek() and poll() will either a) be ready to run at that moment or b) not be ready to run, and by not being ready to run this indicates there are no more scheduled tasks to execute at present.</p>
<p>Here’s the code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    private void processTasks() throws Exception {
        long time = getHighResolutionTimestamp();
        LinkedList&lt;TimedTask&gt; taskList = new LinkedList&lt;TimedTask&gt;();
        TimedTask task = null;

        while ((task = taskQueue.peek()) != null &amp;&amp; task.getExecutionTime() &lt;= time) {
            // This task is due to run -- remove from the priority queue
            // and add it to the list of tasks to execute
            task = taskQueue.poll();
            taskList.add(task);
        }

        // Create a countdown latch for the number of tasks to be executed,
        // and then execute each of the tasks that were obtained from the queue.
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(taskList.size());
        for (Runnable r : taskList) {
            taskExecutorService.execute(new CountdownTaskExecutor(r, latch));
        }

        // Wait for all priority queue tasks that have been schedule to run
        // to complete their execution
        latch.await();

        // Any task that needs to be executed again should be re-added
        // to the task priority queue
        for (TimedTask t : taskList) {
            if (t.shouldRepeat()) {
                taskQueue.offer(t);
            }
        }
    }</code></pre>
<p>One thing that I’ve always been unsure about is the ordering of update packets. Given that each one is a discrete packet handled by the client, I see no reason as to why they can’t be out of order. But it has long been the case that we’ve kept all of that stuff happening sequentially and consistently ordered.<br>
Even if it does need to be ordered though, this idiom can still work. It just means you have a parent task that encompasses the tasks in the correct order.</p>

<p>Also, the other major commiter on MoparClassic and I are working on a RSC project, and we’re integrating actors into everything a bit more. I’m pretty sure the logging has made it into the MoparClassic repo, which makes use of actors. We’re also in the process of reworking the login server and will probably end up using them there, because shit like this is annoying and ugly:</p>

<p>when you click to move somewhere, client generates a path of each tile you move across to get to your location and sends it to the server, which simply confirms each tile is valid to move across. But what happens is when you spam click, it sends this path array to the server each time you click, once the server processes the first path move, it updates your position server-side (then informs client your moving) however when doing this fast, if another of that exact same packet comes through after the server has already moved you, it will essentially move you backwards, i could probably make a diagram explaining this better but i cbf.</p>
<p>so having the server generate the whole path is more cpu intensive, but it keeps the server-side position in sync with everything.[/quote]</p>
<p>I understand now. It makes sense. It would just be a matter of how much stress 2,000 players would put on the cpu.</p>

<p>A bad, but working way to do it would be to change the PathHandler class to look like this:</p>
<p>[code]	private long lastMove = 0;</p>
<pre><code>/**

public void updatePosition() {

We do have a path generator? ‘authentication’? I guess ill never know about Aussie lag until I experience it. Is that big of an issue? Are there any other pros/cons or is it unnecessary?</p>
<p>Asian languages are a must. They still believe starcraft II is top of the line. Just imagine what rsc will do to them.</p>

              <p>we can remove a lot of crap out of the 600ms loop, but i <em>think</em> player positions need to be sent at that pace, anything faster and your character will be running. IIRC the client is designed for a player to move from 1 tile to another in 600ms.</p>
<p>what i think would be a good thing to do (and official RS already implemented this a few years ago) is put the path generation on the server and not the client. this has a cpu cost, however it benefits from ‘walkbacks’ when people spam click on a tile (especially those with higher ping like Australians).</p>
<p>and whilst were at it, localize the server, convert all strings to text for different languages &amp; find a few translators. wouldn’t even take a whole lot of time, not that much text in runescape.</p>

              <p>With RSCD based servers as I have noticed you are very limited on ‘custom’ content. Which I experienced with my lastest project and I think that’s going to be the death of rscps. We all love the idea of a replica but other servers, specifically ‘storkpk’ and a few others really push the bar and bring new excitement.</p>
<p>I am branching away from RSCD and working/learning with a more event driven architecture. Which brought me to the idea of the API (which I forgot Jorgen already made one, I should dig up that copy he gave me)</p>
<p>Ent has the idea. I really wouldn’t mind writing all the plugins and this way we can focus on improving the core of moparclassic/rsca/d. We need to get rid of the 600ms delay and I think we can all agree on that. It’s not hard at it’s current state as it has been done but we really need to separate the content. Which goes back to Jorgens and I original conversation about SoC.</p>

              <p>in my opinion, theres a bunch of frameworks around and server cores, everyone gets stuck on content which is why it goes nowhere. i think we create standard RSC API with plugin support and all work together to rewrite/port RSCD/RSCA/Moparclassic content into plugins. it would take a lot of time and many hands, but you don’t need a whole heap of java skill to do it, just time. have a repository where people submit plugins &amp; others review/rewrite them.</p>
<p>if we create a content standard, people can create whatever framework/engines they want, and just support our content delivery model.</p>
<p>even modding EasyRSC to use the new content standard and people can mess around with plugging in new content through that.</p>

              <p>I believe the original idea came from Object/Jorgen and our long talk on ‘SoC’. The idea is to have an API containing all rsc data. This way people who are creating their own frameworks can easily have the data available with a simple plugin. I have already started this project and used ents catalyst server as an example since it’s pretty bare. (Just proof of concept, I wouldn’t be using that base anyways)</p>
