    <description>Okay i havent coded in a few years and decided to come back the transition into 667s wasnt as hard as i thought but im a bit confused with a couple things. In the duel arena there is NO challenge upon right click so you cannot fight at all. If anyone has any info on this please help i need this the most. Also Dominion tower it gets stuck on the screen that asks to choose taunt and hold on is this supposed to happen? am i suppose to wait or is this a coding error? and last Kalphite queen has never reappeared i thought it was a timer issue like i had with my bandos boss but it wasnt any fix for this? and some monsters just stand there and look at you even when you attack they dont fight back, thanks guys for any help you have and please dont criticize like i said i havent coded in some years so thanks

Credits for the server Laakerrules even though im not hosting just trying to catch the hang of coding again</description>
