    <title>Nokia E71</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nokia-e71/290111</link>
    <description>Are there any owners of the Nokia E71 here? I&#39;m wondering about it&#39;s processing power, I mean sure I can read the specs. But in your opinion is it a powerful phone? I&#39;ve heard rumors of being able to flash it with Windows Mobile 6.1, is there anyone here who can confirm this? There&#39;s supposed to be a new e series, called the E72, I haven&#39;t seen any pictures of it yet, but I may just wait and go with that phone.

I like the hardware behind the E71, I just can&#39;t stand the Symbian OS. If it is possible to flash the E71, it will be a definite purchase.

EDIT: Went to the Nokia website, saw the E72, don&#39;t like it as much as the E71.</description>

              <p>The E71 is good, but if i were you i would get a Blackberry, they are much better and don’t crash like the symbian OS does. I have the Blackberry Bold 9000 and its a brilliant phone, my Dad has the E71 and is jelous of mine.</p>

              <p>Thats supposed to be one of the best non touch screen phones ever made.</p>
<p>While s60 sucks for touchscreens, it is supposed to run awesomely on the nokia e71, so I recommend you get the phone and stick with it.</p>

WM6/.1 at 200mhz runs perfectly well, I had a T32 but it got stolen. WM 6.5 runs really well at at least 400MHZ and has good program performance(like games n shit) at 500+</p>
