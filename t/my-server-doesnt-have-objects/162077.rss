    <title>My server doesn&#39;t Have Objects</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-server-doesnt-have-objects/162077</link>
    <description>Hello Moparscape,I was wondering How Do I add global object&#39;s thing to my server.
I searched my Client.Java and it has no &quot;Makeglobalobject&quot; or &quot;addglobalobject&quot; or Any globalobject Things.
I would Greatly Appreciate if someone could tell me What to add and where to add it so I can make a command like:
Addglobalobject coord1 coord2 etc etc objectid.
Like Other servers,
What is my server base?&gt;
It&#39;s my Rs3 revolution Server made from scratch
~All Help appreciated,Thanks.</description>
