    <description>Yo i am looking to make a team to identify all the globalobject nulls.

incase ur wondering nulls are items that cannot be examined or used (nothing happens when u right click them)

usualy things like walls .floor tiles, and roofs.

i wanna find about 50+ people each to identify 100 nulls each. PLEASE GIVE A VERY GOOD DISCRIPTION OF THE NULL such as (1221 - wall - found at the varock castle has a grey stone pattern.)

please nothing like (1221 - wall - this looks kool.)
or (1221 - dont know what this is.)
or (1221 - nothing.)

if we could identify every null imagine what kind of stuff we could do in runescape. totaly re design it thats what.

post if ur interested or if u have identities of nulls just post em here.

creds in the list to everyone who helps out.</description>
