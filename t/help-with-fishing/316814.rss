<p>Next, you’ll have to show us what you’ve already done. <span class="bbcode-b">THIS IS A MUST!</span> If we want to get anywhere as a community, we’re going to have to quit the spoon-feeding. So if you ask something like “how do I get food healing to work” and show us no previous attempts, you’re not going to get an answer. You may be wondering how a question like this is considered bad. Well, the question asker did not make an attempt to solve the problem him or herself, and is indirectly asking the same question as “tell me how to get food healing work so I can continue my effortless server.” So, remember, show us what you’ve done, what you’ve tried to do, or what you think may work.</p>
