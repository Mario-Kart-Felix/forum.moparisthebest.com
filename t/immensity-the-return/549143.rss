[u][b]Prologue[/b][/u][/CENTER]

Immensity has been on and off for a while now. With the new development team, we hope to make this a much more dedicated project than before. We are currently working on fixing up little bugs and glitches, for the time being. This has become our priority. Once these are taken care of, we plan on bringing you the best content possible. We are glad to take in any suggestions from the Immensity community.


[CENTER][u][b]About the development team[/b][/u][/CENTER]

We are passionate about the runescape game style, and we have been very picky about some updates and changes to the game that we personally think that we can make better. We have worked with previous servers before, and have been quite successful during the time they ran.

To start off we will introduce the Immensity Founder &amp; CEO Anthony. Anthony has been around the rsps community for quite a while now and has a pretty good idea on how to run things. His coding experience isn&#39;t anything special he has just focused on running rsps and learning as he goes. Anthony also does most of our website work because he likes that.

Following Anthony there is Pchase who is the head developer. Pchase is the one that first introduced the rest of the team to rsps long ago. he has at the moment the greatest coding and programming knowledge out of every member of the team.

Last but certainly not least, We have Dominik. He is new to the coding community, but he has been learning slowly. He is mostly pitching ideas, and consulting ideas with us. He plans to be building connections with the community and make sure you&#39;re getting the experience you want with us.
