    <description>What do you think guys

&quot;The short answer is it would take too long to get RSC up to scratch with all the anti macro and rwt fixes, this would be at the expense of RuneScape updates which is simply not an option I&#39;m sure you would agree.
So the only option available to us if we wanted to re-introduce RSC was to provide a few RSC servers with cheat codes so that there was no point in cheating as you could just get what ever you wanted anyway, we will however be providing an interesting twist to the RSC servers that I think players may really enjoy. &quot; -Quote from MMG
