    <title>MooZar Aims To Turn Pirates Into Paying Customers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moozar-aims-to-turn-pirates-into-paying-customers/329461</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;The operators of MooZar, a new service set to launch at the end of February, believe they have the solution to the file-sharing piracy ‘problem’. Illicit downloaders can apparently go to their site, pay some money and feel happy in the knowledge that they’ve supported the artist. Controversially, there are suggestions they won’t get sued either.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now, are all Swedes stupid enough to make such an outlandish statement, or is this statement equally stupid?</p>
<p>Bottom line is that, sooner or later, for better or for worse, the music/movie industries WILL change their approach as we, the public, dictate.
