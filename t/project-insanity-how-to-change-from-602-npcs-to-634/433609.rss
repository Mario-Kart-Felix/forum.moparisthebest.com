    <title>[Project insanity] How to change from 602 npcs to 634</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-insanity-how-to-change-from-602-npcs-to-634/433609</link>
    <description>Okay so I have a really good server that I have spent ages on. It has almost everything working apart from I want 634 npcs rather than 602. When I try and spawn an npc over 11000 it kicks me and I have to restart my client. My game uses a cache with 508 maps 602 npcs and 634 items. is their any possible way on which I could change my npc&#39;s to 634?</description>
