    <description>If i do ::yell command, then it doesn&#39;t work ...

For example:
If i get 99 prayer, then it should tell to all that I just got 99 pray, but it doesn&#39;t...
[code]            if (playerLevel[12] &gt;= 99) {
			sendFrame164(6206);
			sendFrame246(6210, 290, 2714);
			sendFrame126(&quot;Congratulations, you have reached &quot;+playerLevel[12]+&quot; crafting!&quot;, 6207);
			sendFrame126(&quot;Talk to Hans in Lumbridge to recieve your skillcape!&quot;, 6208);
                sendMessage(&quot;Congratulations, you just received the highest possible level in this skill.&quot;);
                PlayerHandler.messageToAll = (playerName + &quot; has just gotten &quot;
                        + playerLevel[12] + &quot; Crafting!&quot;);[/code]

Help please?
Is there any way to rewrite it?
Some say sendMessage might also be sM, but can PlayerHandler.messageToAll be in dif form?</description>
