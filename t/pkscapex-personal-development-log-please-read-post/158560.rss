    <description>[size=4][b]PROUD TO BE SILAB-FREE[/b][/size]

[size=7][b]PLEASE POST DON&#39;T JUST READ[/b][/size]

Firstly this is NOT a Development Team, but its sort of a blog for me to post updates about my upcoming server.

[b]Here are some unique features that will be/already are in the server:[/b]

[u]DONE:[/u]

Wearing black d hide body + chaps reduces the amount of time you are frozen for (With all ice spells) by a third.
Wearing karils top + skirt reduces the amount of time you are frozen for (With all ice spells) by half.
Graphics stay with you, not in the place it started.
Done all ancients graphics.
All spells need runes.
Wilderness areas are IDENTICAL to RuneScape - WILDY AREA ONLY.

[u]NOT DONE:[/u]

Rewritten AttackNPC Method
Rewritten Attack Method
Added single combat areas (50%)
Added 100% Woodcutting
Added 100% Mining
Added 100% Fishing
Added 100% Runecrafting
Added 100% Fletching
Added 100% Firemaking

[b]Here are some things i&#39;ve done to try and make the server better for everyone:[/b]

Completely removed ranged, although you can still train it because you need 70 Ranged for Black Dragonhide. The reason i&#39;ve removed it is because it is the most glitchiest combat skill ever,.

Completely removed magics on NPC&#39;s. Reason behind this is it makes the NPC Follow you, and it will make it better for everyone IMO.

Completely removed Modern Magic&#39;s. I found it will be much better to just offer ancient magics, much cleaner, too. Teleblock will be smoke rush. This also defeats the training of magic through alching and will encourage players to use the Mage Training Arena minigame.

[b]Screenshots:[/b]

I will add screenshots soon.

VPS &#39;Technical&#39; Details:

The server will be hosted on a 24/7 VPS Which i did pay for, the VPS Specs are here:

Basically this computer will only be running the server... Free 200 players pl0x?

[b]Server &#39;Technical&#39; Details:[/b]

Size of client.java: 399KB!

[b]Currently Working On:[/b]

NPC Training Areas

[b]The Economy:[/b]

PKScapeX WILL Have a full economy, no buying 100 party hats from santa for 5gp each. No typing ::money for 2147M. To earn money you WILL need to skill/pk.

There will be no commands except &quot;::yell:&quot; and &quot;::players&quot;.

There will be certain minigames like a custom Mage Training Arena for mage books, master wands &amp; infinity armour.

[b]NPC Training:[/b]

There is FULL NPC Training! Although object training is offered for those players who choose to, there is also NPC training where you will get 50xp per hit, and the chance of getting good drops.

[b]Your Support:[/b]

Thanks for reading and all support is appreciated for example idea&#39;s, CONSTRUCTIVE critism, etc.

Thanks.

Also, anyone flaming will just be reported.</description>
