              <p>Yes, you need to give them the client files. You can JAR the client as above said, or you can delete the .java files after you compile. The JVM only runs the .class files. Then, hide the files inside the folder, making only the batch file for the client visible. Delete the compiler and any other tools as well. It’s difficult to make the client completely uneditable.</p>

<p>LOL, you can easily modify a .jar, or even release all the files in .class.<br>
Called JAD Decompiler for java, get one.</p>
