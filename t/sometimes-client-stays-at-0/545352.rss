    <title>Sometimes client stays at 0%</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sometimes-client-stays-at-0/545352</link>
    <description>Ok so, I&#39;m using Rune evo V3 source and foxtrot client, and sometimes when i run the client it stays at checking for updates - 0%, and then i have to close it and open a new one, some times multiple times for it to load, and I dont know if that will happen to other players and if it does they will probably think that the server is offline and wont play.

If you know how to fix this please respond. 
Thanks</description>
