    <description>Hello, I can&#39;t get my server to work, I have searched around and corrected various things according to guides and tutorials here on the website, but I still can&#39;t get it to work. Please help. Below is a picture! I&#39;ve tried many things, different compilers, etc.

You might see the picture best if you download the picture I attached.

Heres what the colors mean starting with number 1 (the light green one) of the color coded boxes at the bottom:

1. Runserver.bat
2. System Properties - Environment Variables
3. Java Folder
4. Linksys ROUTER
5. Me talking to my friend trying to join server
6. Router IP Address
7. My Modem Information
8. Ipconfig
9. No-IP

And my no-ip pic is there but I accidently made it orange.

1st.  I have no-ip running

4th.  I try to login on moparscape

Question:

I join my server by logging in with:
Server IP:  0.0.0.0
Port:  43594

Others try to join my server with:
Server IP: name_of_server.no-ip.info
Port:  43594

I can logon but noone else can. I have read the probably about every guide on here. I think have forwarded ALL my ports correctly. Disabled Firewalls. Disabled Anti-virus.

What could mainly be the problem is my router and mode. I have a seperate router and a seperate modem:

DSL  --&gt; modem --&gt; router --&gt; Wireless

Thats my setup ^

My router ip is 192.168.128.1 and my modem ip is 192.168.1.1
Both of those can not be the same or my internet won&#39;t work.

Under my modem, here is some information:

 LAN - Setup
DHCP
   DHCP                                              Server
   Client IP Pool Starting Address               192.168.1.2
   Size of Client IP Pool                           1
   Primary DNS Server                         0.0.0.0
   Secondary DNS Server                       0.0.0.0
   Remote DHCP Server                        N/A
 
TCP/IP
   IP Address                                      192.168.1.1
   IP Subnet Mask                                    255.255.255.252
   RIP Direction                                       Both
   RIP Version                                       RIP-2B
   Multicast                                       IGMP-v2

This is under Site Map on my Modem:

 Site Map
 
  Wizard Setup        Advanced Setup        Maintenance
Wizard Setup                 Password                        System Status
                                   LAN                               DHCP Table
                                   NAT                               Diagnostic
                                 Security                           Firmware
                                 Dynamic DNS
                                   Remote Management


My modem is from Zyxel

My router (WRT54GS) &#39;s:

local Ip address:  192.168.128.1
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Starting Ip address: 192.168.128.100
Static DNS 1 (2 and 3 as well)   is currently 0.0.0.0  ( I can change these)

Port Forward

43594 to 43594   TCP/UDP  192.168.128.100  Enabled


DMZ Host IP Address:  192.168.128.2

I DONT Have anything set under port triggering.
I have a tab called QoS that looks kind of like port forwarding if I enable it.

<p>As you can see it is running pimpscape on port 5555, not 43594, So that could the problem, although i did not read the whole entire post.</p>
