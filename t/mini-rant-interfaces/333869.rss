    <title>Mini-Rant(Interfaces)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mini-rant-interfaces/333869</link>
    <description>Ok, just thought i&#39;d go on a mini rant about interface development. Lin created the interface maker, so that you could all make nice new interfaces. But you all are missing the point. most of you  are making interfaces which server ONE purpose. Like, many of the login screens i see. The sprites are built into the interface. Why not just make an entity that the end-user can change at their whim? Think about it. Most of the default interfaces were designed for one particular purpose, but was left abstract enough to be served as other purposes as they saw fit. Like the Quest interface. It is what i call an ActionList Interface. It&#39;s a list, with X elements, and each element sends a packet when it&#39;s clicked. Do you see that these days? No. You see login screens where everything is static, or unchangeable. Now, this may provide a type of faux &quot;copyright&quot;, but honestly, can&#39;t you be a bit more creative. Can&#39;t you think more outside the box, than making an interface that takes up half the screen, but the content inside that frame only takes up maybe 1/4 of the frame&#39;s size? Honestly now, are you all, I don&#39;t know, mentally inept? Or is it really that difficult to come up with an interface that can be served for MULTIPLE purposes?</description>

              <p>Ok, just thought i’d go on a mini rant about interface development. Lin created the interface maker, so that you could all make nice new interfaces. But you all are missing the point. most of you  are making interfaces which server ONE purpose. Like, many of the login screens i see. The sprites are built into the interface. Why not just make an entity that the end-user can change at their whim? Think about it. Most of the default interfaces were designed for one particular purpose, but was left abstract enough to be served as other purposes as they saw fit. Like the Quest interface. It is what i call an ActionList Interface. It’s a list, with X elements, and each element sends a packet when it’s clicked. Do you see that these days? No. You see login screens where everything is static, or unchangeable. Now, this may provide a type of faux “copyright”, but honestly, can’t you be a bit more creative. Can’t you think more outside the box, than making an interface that takes up half the screen, but the content inside that frame only takes up maybe 1/4 of the frame’s size? Honestly now, are you all, I don’t know, mentally inept? Or is it really that difficult to come up with an interface that can be served for MULTIPLE purposes?</p>
