    <title>Should Mexico be wiped off the map?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-mexico-be-wiped-off-the-map/252944</link>
    <description>Before you start saying &quot;z0mg racist maxicens r nicee pepel and make tawcows&quot; just listen. People in America, who commit rape, murder, or any other serious crime are always being hunted down. They somehow manage to find a way to sneak into Mexico, where they can&#39;t be arrested. What a piece of crap. They start hoping our boarders, filling our streets with gangs, and make hard working people like us LEARN SPANISH. Those spicks should just stay as landscapers for the rest of their lives. Those damn Mexicans, after all we provide for them, won&#39;t allow us to bring criminals to justice!</description>

Most muslims in America are smart. They are doctors etc. But the ones that go to Europe are fucking retarded. They steal, do nothing, and expect respect and want to change traditions.</p>
<p>But this thread is a fine example of the American attitude towards the rest of the world: If they cause a problem, annihilate them.<br>

<p>Yes, just here in England we get Polish, Russians, Muslims, Pakistanis etc etc.</p>

<p>Starting a nuclear war with a country because you have an immigrant problem isn’t a very good idea at all. In fact, the only country I see doing this would be stereotypical USA.</p>

<p>Ummm, most of the idiots thinking they can jump the border and not get arrested are retarded, because most of them cross illegally no matter which way they come from they are still gonna get arrested for that.</p>
<p>And you are being racist, I’m pretty sure that you are not 100% American, as most of the people on here aren’t, because they are not related to American indians, most of them are idiots who think they are American because they live in America, If you live here legally, You’re an American citizen, not an American.</p>
<p>What that means is that your family immigrated from some place like the “spicks” do. There is alot of Mexican gangs, But not everyone, Give me the name of a single Native American gang and then I’ll support your argument, There are gangs from all different cultures.</p>
<p>Why don’t you look in the mirror and read some books about Mexico and America. Mexicans immigrate to America because they aren’t many jobs, and they live in harsh conditions. You should be lucky that you live in America rather then in the conditons that they do</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Muslims don’t make gangs in America. We make gangs outside of America and bomb places. Also, no one has to change their way of life because we live in America. (not unless they’re paranoid). We didn’t come in such numbers to force people to learn our language. No one goes to the middle east when they commit a crime, if they do, then <span class="bbcode-b">they will most likely be shot, in whatever country regardless of what he/she has done. </span><br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>The bold part is wrong. I highly doubt that you’d get convicted for a crime you’ve committed overseas, either way, you don’t get shot.[/quote]<br>
No, I mean. As soon as a muslim sees an American, they hate them. So chances are they will be shot.</p>

<p>Ummm, most of the idiots thinking they can jump the border and not get arrested are retarded, because most of them cross illegally no matter which way they come from they are still gonna get arrested for that.</p>
<p>And you are being racist, I’m pretty sure that you are not 100% American, as most of the people on here aren’t, because they are not related to American indians, most of them are idiots who think they are American because they live in America, If you live here legally, You’re an American citizen, not an American.</p>
<p>What that means is that your family immigrated from some place like the “spicks” do. There is alot of Mexican gangs, But not everyone, Give me the name of a single Native American gang and then I’ll support your argument, There are gangs from all different cultures.</p>
<p>Why don’t you look in the mirror and read some books about Mexico and America. Mexicans immigrate to America because they aren’t many jobs, and they live in harsh conditions. You should be lucky that you live in America rather then in the conditons that they do<br>

Muslims don’t make gangs in America. We make gangs outside of America and bomb places. Also, no one has to change their way of life because we live in America. (not unless they’re paranoid). We didn’t come in such numbers to force people to learn our language. No one goes to the middle east when they commit a crime, if they do, then <span class="bbcode-b">they will most likely be shot, in whatever country regardless of what he/she has done. </span>[/quote]</p>
<p>The bold part is wrong. I highly doubt that you’d get convicted for a crime you’ve committed overseas, either way, you don’t get shot.</p>
