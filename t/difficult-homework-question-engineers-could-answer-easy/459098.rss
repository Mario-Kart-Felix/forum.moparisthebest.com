    <description>The question.

A first class lever in static equilibrium has a 50lb resistance force and 15lb effort force. The levers effort force is located 4ft from the fulcrum.

What is the Actual mechanical advantage (AMA) of the system?

Using static equilibrium calculations, calculate the length from the fulcrum to the resistance force.

I find this difficult to do in 9th grade.</description>

              <p>Let me get my engineering class stuff out from last year. Iirc moment is when the ft•Lbs are equal. Like on a teeter totter.</p>
<p>First thing you need to do is calculate the distance between the resistance force and the fulcrum. You can figure this out by figuring out the moment for static equilibrium(sorry if my vocab is bad, its been a while).<br>
15lb • 4ft = 50lb • xft<br>
60ft • lb = 50x ft•lb<br>
60ft•Lb/50lb = x ft<br>
1.2 ft = x ft.</p>
<p>Now that we have the distances, we need the AMA. AMA is calculated by the ratio between the resistance force and the effort force.<br>
50/15 = 10/3 = 10 : 3.</p>
<p>For shits and giggles I calculated the efficiency of the lever and its 100%. You have a pretty efficient lever right there. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

I appreciate the fact that you’re trying to help, but moment doesn’t mean that in this context. (How did you figure the question out without knowing what it is?) It refers to the turning effect caused by a force.</p>

<p>A moment (momentum) was a medieval unit of time. The movement of a shadow on a sundial covered 40 moments in a solar hour. An hour in this case means one twelfth of the period between sunrise and sunset. The length of a solar hour depended on the length of the day, which in turn varied with the season, so the length of a moment in modern seconds was not fixed, but on average, a moment corresponds to 90 seconds. A day was divided into 24 hours of both equal and unequal lengths, the former The unit...</p>

<p>Static just means that it is not moving. A first class lever is one that has the fulcrum in the middle between the resistance force and the effort force (thank you Wikipedia). The reason that it is not moving is that the moment (force times distance) generated by the effort side is the same as the moment generated on the resistance side. Effort times effort distance = Resistance times resistance distance. They tell you that the effort force is 15 lb and the effort distance is 4 ft so the effort moment is 60 ft-lb , and we know that the resistance moment is the same (because it is in static equilibrium. So the resistance distance (length from the resistance force to the fulcrum) is 60 ft-lb / 50 lb = 1.20 ft.</p>
