    <description>Hi,
I didn&#39;t know where to put this so I&#39;m sorry if this is the wrong forum.
Well anyway; nearly every shop keeper on my server is taken up and
I cant find anymore :mad: and I know some server, have shopkeepers
without the trade option......
Do you have to put a code?
Or do you just put the npc as a shopkeeper?
thx ;D</description>
