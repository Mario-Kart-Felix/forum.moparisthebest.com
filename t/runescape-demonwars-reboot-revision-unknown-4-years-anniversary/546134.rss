    <title>RuneScape DemonWars Reboot. (revision unknown) (4 years anniversary)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-demonwars-reboot-revision-unknown-4-years-anniversary/546134</link>
    <description>Hey!
I am DemonWars as some of you will know.

Today has been my 20th Birthday, and i can&#39;t believe it has been 4 years since i have registered here..
I am proud to be a (somewhat ex) coder, and i have learned so much in the recent 4 years..
I am quite ashamed of my old grammar from a few years ago though..

In any case!

I realise that i have made alot of mistakes in the past regarding the servers i coded, like bugs, fails, crashes and projects like constitution which i have left as a WIP.
But i&#39;m also quite proud of what i have achieved, like building the first 508 HD Custom Client (woot!) (Credits NOOBS_ARE_FTW for without him i wouldn&#39;t have succeeded)
Or my latest project RSDWv2, which was a server with my own twist on the magic system, full NPC transformations and my fresh ideas..

BUT!
I have decided to make a new server, a stable, well-maintained server!
but i can&#39;t do this on my own.

I need someone who can code clients.
Someone who is good at graphical design.
Someone who is good at fixing bugs.
And someone who can help me code the server.

This team should be able to bring up and discuss any idea, nothing isn&#39;t possible if you use your imagination!
I am unsure of which revision i will use, (NOT 317!) so if you don&#39;t want to help but you have a revision which you favor, COMMENT DOWN BELOW &lt;3

I will hold online test events in which people may try the system and find bugs, i will also hold a alpha and a beta before releasing it.

Alpha testers will get a in-game reward as with Beta testers.
There WILL be a donating system with in-game rewards. 
any amount donated will be used to support online activity and money that is left will be divided through out the team.
everyone will get their own fair share, and income will be shown on the site.

I am unsure of making a online shop for in-game items.

And yes, as with the online server, i WILL release a offline server that you can use for yourself.
i will include watermarks incase you wish to release a server for yourself.

King&#39;s Regards.
           DemonWars.</description>

<p>I am now strongly considering a 718 loading 748, it’s really stable and has a perfect structure as far as my needs go.<br>
And yes i do agree that there aren’t enough 562’s out there, but it is too similair to 508 in my opinion.</p>
