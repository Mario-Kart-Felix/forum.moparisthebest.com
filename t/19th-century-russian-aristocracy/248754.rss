    <title>19th Century Russian Aristocracy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/19th-century-russian-aristocracy/248754</link>
    <description>I have choose to do A Problem by Anton Chekhov for my research report in Honors English, it isn&#39;t due for awhile but I want to get a head start because of a reason I will explain later. I must elaborate on how 19th Century Aristocrats choose family honor before good behavior. Well first let me give you the background.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the nineteenth century, members of the Russian aristocracy lived on wealth that had accumulated generations earlier. For this class, honor meant more than display of good behavior. Honor required preserving the reputation and heritage of a long-standing family name. When good fortunes changed and money became unavailable, a family name and its history of prosperity suggested the promise of stability to come. Such a promise was often all the aristocrats could rely on to save them from imminent finical disaster.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ive been searching Google for awhile now and haven&#39;t been able to find anything on [b]19th Century Russian Aristocracy or Honor[/b] Do any of you know of some books are some websites where I can find information on this subject.

Here is my reason for starting early, I have had all A&#39;s in my 4 classes at the beginning of the year, then I just checked and I have a 74 In Honors English, while I have A&#39;s in all my other classes. I really need to help my English grade to a B average by the end of the semester, any resources would be appreciated.</description>
