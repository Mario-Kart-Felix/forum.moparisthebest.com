<p>Mmmm not really, if you apply that logic in real terms then charaties would be much harder to work for. I see where you’re coming from but we have to set a middle ground somewhere.</p>

</aside>
<p>In this case, you should be posting your pro’s…<br>
I.E: Past projects, history in rsps, history in programming, etc.</p>
<p>If I were looking for a partner, I wouldn’t consider you because I know nothing about you.<br>
Good luck though.</p>

              <p>Same goes for you and looking for a team…</p>
<p>Why should I add you to my team? I’m a perfectly fine developer on my own. What makes me want to add you to my team? You’ve posted no background information about you, nor any previous works. And it’s not like your name is known around here like some of the past “greats”.</p>
<p>And you have to keep in mind that here on moparscape, we’re not really allowed to talk about finances for a server. It’s in the rules we cannot offer rewards, or the like. So, I mean, technically, people cannot say “paying a developer”. You’d have to ask them via pm or off site.</p>
