    <title>Help? Anti-Null [[WILL REP ++]]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-anti-null-will-rep/345657</link>
    <description>I need a bit of help.. I have an allstar-scape source and it is most certainly not anti null. I was wondering if someone could go through their source and find the anti null? I&#39;ve downloaded several sources and looked through to try to find the anti null but couldn&#39;t find it. Only 1 out of those 7 actually have an anti null in it. I&#39;m still looking, and while I&#39;m looking, can someone please give me a code? I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one that needs an anti-null code. It will help more than just me  :D</description>
