    <title>On behalf of Wrench_King</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/on-behalf-of-wrench-king/393768</link>
    <description>It might not be apparent to some but the server glitched last night, alot of things were messed up in the process, and i witnessed it all myself, chests crashing players, previous blocks placed are gone in random increments, and items missing.

Wrench_King&#39;s inventory was glitched and he is unable to login without his client crashing instantly, not minecraft login, the /login command on the server itself.

He has asked me to post this to have his inventory wiped so he can login.

If you do not believe anything glitched, take a look at the chest that is on the bank of the lake in david&#39;s empire, crashes the minecraft client whenever you try to open it.</description>
