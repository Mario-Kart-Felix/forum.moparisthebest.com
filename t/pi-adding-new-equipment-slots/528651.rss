    <title>[Pi] adding new equipment slots</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-adding-new-equipment-slots/528651</link>
    <description>I thought of an idea and thought maybe i can do it. So i thought of adding auras/tails/some other things. But i wanted that those things go into slots. So that people would look cooler and stuff.
So. How can i add more equipment slots? What&#39;s the client/server sided work is needed? Any tutorials at adding aura slots?
Thank you.</description>
