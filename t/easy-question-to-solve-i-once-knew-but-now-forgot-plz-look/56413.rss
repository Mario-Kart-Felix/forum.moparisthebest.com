              <p>Hi,<br>
If I were you i’d try the “perfect compiler”.<br>
It automatically detecs where your javac and java files are and compiles very good. Other than that, it could be that you have a compiler that only works with your sever source so then you need to change this(OR whatever you have):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> javac -g:none -nowarn -d ./Class/ ./Java/*.java</code></pre>
<p>TO this:<code> "C:\ProgramFiles\Java\jdk1.6.0\bin\javac.exe"  -g:none -nowarn -d./Class/ ./Java/*.java</code></p>
<p>Conclusion: Your computer might have not recongnized the “javac” command all by itself. That normally is caused by not setting the right classpaths(or not at all). To make it easier for you now, I just changed the javac to the path of where the java is installed(this could be different on your computer so edit the path or it wont work). When you did this, and of course dont forget, you have installed the new jdk1.6.0 into c:\whatever you should be able to start&amp;compile your server! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Have fun!</p>
