    <title>I followed all the instructions...ANYONE GONNA HELP?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-followed-all-the-instructions-anyone-gonna-help/142254</link>
    <description>OK, i followed all the instructions found at the guide here;

http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,189074.0.html and my server still will not work. I&#39;ll go though and checklist everything I did, so you guys can see and maybe you can help.

Chapter 1: Getting JDK 6u2. I have downloaded it and installed it.

Chapter 2: downloading and installing No-Ip. I downloaded and installed it. I now get a little icon on my tool bar that says &#39;ip&#39; with a no symbol over it. I have signed in with my email address and password. I can see &#39;Syrillia.no-ip.org&#39; there. The check box next to it is ticked and there is a happy face. On no-ip.com I have registered, and I have added a host. The name of the host is &#39;Syrillia.no-ip.org&#39;, my host type is &#39;DNS Host (A)&#39; and I left my IP address as automatic. Which is 82.29.149.25. I might as well tell you because it will make it easier. That was the only thing I changed. No Ip is running with these settings and I have refreshed it.

Chapter 3: Getting a Client
I downloaded moparscape. I installed it and it runs OK. I can access other servers and play and everything.


Chapter 4
Opening 43594 (Default Port)
I did this. When I open the Exception &#39;Syrillia&#39; I get this.

Name: Syrillia
Port Number: 43594
TCP(o) UDP( )

When I click the scope button, it includes any computer, even those on the internet.

Chapter 5
Port forwarding (Router Users, Using Linksys)
I&#39;m using a router. It&#39;s make is &#39;Belkin&#39;. It&#39;s model is &#39;F5D8230-4&#39;
The guide I followed is found here:

http://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Belkin/F5D8230-4/1st_SMTP_Server.htm

This is the bit where I think something has gone wrong. But maybe not, so don&#39;t focus here too much.

This is what I was told to put in for the guide, so I did. If there&#39;s anything missing, let me know.

Chapter 6
Getting a source
Got testscape. The compiler works, double-checked this. When I run server is says &#39;starting server on 0.0.0.0:43594&#39;
Then, if I load up moparscape, I enter &#39;localhost&#39; with my username and password, and it opens the games controls, but the play window is black with &#39;Loading - Please Wait&#39; and then doesn&#39;t do anything. Also, no one else can connect to the server.

Any Help?</description>
