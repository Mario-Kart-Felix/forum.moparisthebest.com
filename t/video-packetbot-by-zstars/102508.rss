    <title>[Video] PacketBot by Zstars</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/video-packetbot-by-zstars/102508</link>
    <description>Although such methods maybe detectable and _always_ detectable, zstars has been working on packet reversing, as many of you know.  He&#39;s actually managed to get a bot going.  This is a very tedious task, but it&#39;s pretty neat to figure out what each packet does and how it holds data.  (The only packet I&#39;ve partially reversed was the one that is sent when you use one item in your inventory on another item in your inventory.)  

Anyways, here&#39;s a video.  He knows what he&#39;s doing since, well, he can teach it (My AlgII teacher says teaching is like learning twice).  
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=5MZLHXL6

I&#39;ll relay what you guys think to him since he can&#39;t really see it.  I didn&#39;t trust it with the CM section.  zstars wants it on the down-low, and he said I could put it here.</description>

What I did with him was opened up a client in JSwat (For debugging purposes), added a few print methods to get some data we want, set breakpoints on the prints when a certain ID we're looking for comes through, and then we use Wireshark to sniff the outgoing packets.  We look for the encoded opcode in the packet, and that is the start of the packet.  The rest is the data we need.  
<p>I haven’t gotten into sending packets yet.  I’ve just been naming the parts and the documenting them.</p>
<p>About updating, we’re not entirely sure yet.  RS hasn’t updated in three weeks, iirc.  But if the packets data just changes, but looks generally the same, it might not be to difficult to do.</p>

<p>That does look great…very impressive.  But I do agree with Mopar, updating a bot like that would be extremely tedious, no?  Unless I heard wrong, don’t they modify the packet structures slightly with each release?  That’s one of the reasons I never got into Rs2 bot development much…too frequent client updates and no simple way of updating (before the renamer craze at least).  But hey, if he’s found a way, that’s excellent <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
