    <description>Like i was going through the server downloads board, and im reading through a 718&#39;s replies, and theres like 12 first time posters asking the stupidest and simplest questions that could be solved with common knowladge and google. Like jre_connect. Easy to solve. Those http Compiler errors or whatever, EASY TO SOLVE. It saddens me to see all this stupidity on the internet, You can be ANYTHING you want on the internet, Instead these people choose to be stupid. Just sayin. :P</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>There are several factors that could benefit to a post being ‘dumb’. The first dead giveaway is that they are new to this forum, and quite possibly new to forums altogether. Another reason being that not everyone is computer/internet savvy (My step-mother worked in technology for almost 20 years and in my 20 years on this planet I’ve achieved a greater knowledge of the internet than she ever will. The final reason I will post is a persons age… Its unbelievable how early in life kids are getting into the internet.</p>
<p>Allow me to bore you with a story:<br>
Sometime in middle school I was introduced to RuneScape, prior to that I had only played console games and the internet played almost no role in my life. After playing RuneScape for a couple years and getting scammed and hacked as many careless child were I discovered a RuneScape where I could spawn items… At the time this was the single player MoparScape, I eventually discovered multi-player servers and after playing them for so long I decided I wanted my own server. Keep the following in mind…</p>
<ul>
<li>I had no knowledge of Java</li>
<li>I had no knowledge of and programming</li>
<li>I had almost no experience using the internet</li>
<li>I didn’t have the slightest clue how RSPS worked</li>
</ul>
<p>Whereas now:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have mastered Java (according to my college)</li>
<li>I have picked up PHP, COBOL, and C#</li>
<li>The internet is my second home</li>
<li>I’m very familiar with the 317 protocol and have written multiple bases</li>
</ul>
<p>You can look at some of my earliest posts and you will find that they are questions a newbie would ask. I wouldn’t go as far to say someones post is dumb especially if they are making an effort to learn something they want to do. First Time Posters are not dumb, they simply have yet to learn the ways of RSPS/Forums/Etc.</p>
<p>Consider the following simile:<br>
Getting started in the world of RS emulation is like being thrown into a foreign country with no concept of the language and no idea where to go.</p>
<p>IMHO of course…</p>

<p>Those people are young, they’re immature, they lack the attention span required to focus on programming I could list hundreds of reasons. Your posts are almost exactly the same as them. Most of us were those people at once so don’t be so sure as to say they’re dumb when they might well be one of the best programmers to emerge from RSPS in just 3 or 4 years time. You’re basically comparing 16/17/18 year olds who have been focusing on programming for a number of years to 11/12 year olds who have no clue. You can’t possibly call them “dumb”.</p>

<p>Still, Atleast I looked around and used google before asking on the forums, Most prroblems i deal with myself. I Don’t give up easy. But its the simple questions that are already awnsered in the exact forum they are posting on that have already been awnsered on a different page, if they took the 10 minutes to look, they would find the awnser.</p>

              <p>Like i was going through the server downloads board, and im reading through a 718’s replies, and theres like 12 first time posters asking the stupidest and simplest questions that could be solved with common knowladge and google. Like jre_connect. Easy to solve. Those http Compiler errors or whatever, EASY TO SOLVE. It saddens me to see all this stupidity on the internet, You can be ANYTHING you want on the internet, Instead these people choose to be stupid.
