    <title>Red orchestra 2 $5 on steam</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/red-orchestra-2-5-on-steam/476112</link>
    <description>If you want a super realistic shooter than isn&#39;t as frustratingly stupid as ARMA you should really get this


Its amazing. Tons of custom maps, 32vs32 wars


Isn&#39;t like call of duty at all, cover is actually useful, amazing built in cover system, can be shot in foot and hand and still survive, 1 shot to the torso will kill someone, guns aren&#39;t laser-beam accurate (theyre realistic)


and on max the game is sexy as love
