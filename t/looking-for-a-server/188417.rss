    <title>Looking For A Server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-server/188417</link>
    <description>Well im from Gamerz Heaven and im looking for someone with high upload and a nice comp to host the server and also a developer for it. I figured this would be a great way to start a community. Or the person could host and develope would be even better because we wouldnt have to wait for stuff to be updated. Also the server needs to be atleast 22/7 if not i will not take the offer. My website is www.ghforum.net this is not at all looking to be a advertisment for my site im just looking for a server staff. 

Any questions contact me via msn: ownedggre@hotmail.com

Also my email is : chyboz@hotmail.com

Thanks,
