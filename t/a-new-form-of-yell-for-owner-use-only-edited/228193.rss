    <title>A new form of yell (for owner use only) [EDITED]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-new-form-of-yell-for-owner-use-only-edited/228193</link>
    <description>okay well in some servers, the owner has an ::lupdate command set... and also ::rules, and even some owners (the lagit ones) like to keep their players updated on their server such as What&#39;s New, What&#39;s Coming up, and other things such as this... I am one of those owners that likes to keep my players up-to-date on what I&#39;m doing, but for some reason the ::yell command doesnt seem to cut it for these stupid noobs... okay here&#39;s my scenario

I type in ::yell Hey there everyone, I&#39;m about the update the sever in 5 minutes, so everyone please finish what you&#39;re doing...
Then I do the same thing for 4 minutes (I don&#39;t just sit there staring at the clock, I&#39;m testing the final update that I&#39;m going to add and compile it to the server at about 1-2 minutes left...) and every 3 minutes, and every 2 minutes and 1 minute, until I send the final message telling people that the server will be up in about 1 minute after I re-compile and then run the server again... 
So then I run the server again, and I see that I have lost some people, and then I get a whole bunch of faggots running around saying &quot;OMG I was right in the middle of pking someone!&quot; and &quot;I just lost all of my shit!&quot; and other things... And they seem to totally ignore the fact that I have just updated a HUGE Clan Wars glitch, and that I have updated a HUGE Pking glitch... but all they care about is that they lost their fucking items because they can&#39;t read worth shit!

[s]So what I want is a way to use &quot;sendQuest&quot; in an alert instead me having to use ::yell all of the time and the stupid noobs complaining because I didnt warn them... is there a way that I could do this?[/s]


Thanks to Retard Monkey&#39;s idea, I&#39;ve decided to change my original task from the 
&quot;sendQuest&quot; alert to the alert that is used in real Runescape... Now I want to make a command like   ::updatestart   and what this would do is make a countdown timer in the corner of the screen saying &quot;Update in - 5:00&quot;   and it would count down until 0:01, then the server would turn off by itself until I ran the server again...  
also, just so I don&#39;t end up fucking up, I also need to make a command like    ::updateabort   which would stop the countdown timer and then say 
&quot;Update - Aborted&quot; in the corner of the screen, also I could have  ::updatepause   which would pause the timer, and maybe even have   ::updateinfo which would create another interface underneath the countdown timer, but it could be like the yell command... so it would go like this...
::updateinfo &quot;I am going to be updating a few Clan Wars glitches, and some Pking glitches as well&quot;
so that way the players would know what I&#39;m updating...
so if anyone would like to help out like maybe give me a head start or a push in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated (btw, I will give credits to those that help me)</description>

              <p>That’s a pretty good idea! thanks Monkey, I know HOW to put the countdown timer in the corner, and I’m pretty sure I know how to make it count down, but I wouldn’t have the slightest clue as to how I could make it appear there…<br>
I suppose I could make the command like<br>
::updatestart<br>
and make an interface for it in the corner of the screen, but I don’t know how I would send it to all of the players… It would be easy to make it appear, just not for everyone…</p>
<p>so yeah new plan…</p>

              <p>Well is there any way that you could put the server update in the corner, like they do in real runescape?</p>
<p>Like they have the writing that says ‘Update in 5:00’, and it counts down.<br>
If you could do that, I’d really like the code =D!</p>
