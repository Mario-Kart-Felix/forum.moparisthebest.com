              <p>OK…minus the render, I would think I just got hit by a car or something, which is why the text is all fuzzy and there is a bright light shining at my face. I won’t give you a rating, but I will say this. When I first started out with graphics, I made ALOT worse.</p>

<p>How dare you, it may be fuzzy, and low res, but you shouldn’t criticize the render. The rest of the sig is different, it looks like you used some kind of lens flare or something, and then you used your name in large letters. It’s not really anything, just kind of put a picture, and made a weird background, and slapped some text on it. If I were you, I would look into some Text effect tuts, and some Render blending Tuts, also some grunge sig tuts. That’ll be the best thing you can do at this point.</p>
<p>I give it a 3.97/10[/quote]</p>
<p>the grunge tuts is your preference it doesnt mean he should start there =\ he should start with what he likes</p>
<p>also the render is kinda random compared to whats going on and there is no blending and the text just takes up space not sure what to say about the text =\</p>

<p>The background is made with paint brush and I used an effect to bring brush strokes out then softened it.</p>
