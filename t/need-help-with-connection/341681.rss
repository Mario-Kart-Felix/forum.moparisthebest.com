Ok, that I no, u need the Client to run on ur ip, if it’s 88.88.88.88 then change the ip the client connects to, and make sure the server is online when u try to start the client.<br>
[/quote] Yes, but im not the hoster. on my PC the server lags if im hosting. i gave it to a friend so he can host. I’ve added his IP address into Gui.Java then i compiled… everything is fine One day I logged into the server, it was working 100%, then we started advertising, and now like 8ppl not verry much, but a good start. then that day i Wanted to log out, i Pressed the log out button like 3 times. Now i cant log in. Then i changed the IP in the gui to my ip. and the same error. I restarted the server. Its working, Ive tested, then i told him to restart. he restarted like 10 times, but Still NOTHING! its really anoing. and like 3 ppl have the same error…<br>

<p>Portforwarding is when you open an port on your router for access by other people on the internet so they can recieve and send packets through it. (in this case port: 43594, for your internet browser it uses 80);</p>
