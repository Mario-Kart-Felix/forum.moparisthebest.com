              <p>[quote=“alexia, post:9, topic:40843”]I hate you people that think even the worst pictures, if they were done in paint, are good. There is a lot of good work that is done in paint, and that is not one of them.</p>
<p>Honestly, this signature is awful. All that you did is take some pictures of spiderman and some pink dude, that someone else made, put it in paint, and use the spraypaint tool. It is awful. One of the worst that I have ever seen. If you actually put in some time and effor, it would have turned out much better… How long did this take you? I am guessing about 15-30 minutes. Most good signatures that are made in paint take much more time than that. I have spent up to 30 hours on something to make it look good. Heck… I know someone that spends 50-60 hours on a signature to make it good.</p>
<p>The sad part is that everyone thinks it is so great. If you said that it was made in a different program, people would been like, “OMGZ! 0.1/10!!!”… In my opinion, paint is one of the better programs out there.</p>
<p>Your “(dont laugh i made o paint lol)” comment made me want to kill you. It isn’t paint that made it bad. It is the effort that you put into it that made it bad.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anyways… since obviously, you are clueless, I will give you a little hint. When you open paint, look at the toolbar on the left. Click the maginfying glass. It will help you out a lot.</p>
