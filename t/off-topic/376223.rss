    <description>I know this is for improving the server status page, but how do you guys think rsps&#39;s will be if free trade + wild comes back?

I would rather post this here with some more experienced people rather than.. yea :p


I think, a lot of servers will die off or at least loose a good amount of players but p-servers will still be popular just because its different. But who really knows my theory is the people who play rsps&#39;s well most players are people that fail at RS, or are bored with it.</description>

              <p>I truely think that a reverse effect of what was happening in the past months will happen by febuary. Servers with higher revisions such as 508+ will start to get pointless as it’s a complete copy of runescape and wouldn’t be very appealing as they can log into the real thing and do the same stuff. But servers such as 317, alot of it is focused on custom content that owners put in that seem pretty creative or focused on the skilling side etc. Newer revision and pking servers will take a huge hit but servers that are more focused on fun and the old days will probably just stay strong as they always have.</p>

              <p>i believe a big part of the reason people play rsps is because of the pking, but they like beccause they can pk and risk and not have to worry about years of work only a day or few days haha <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
