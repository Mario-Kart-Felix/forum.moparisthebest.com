    <title>Need help with Aeolian Clientq</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-aeolian-clientq/352696</link>
    <description>I only have one problem.

His spray he put on, can someone tell me how to get it off? I put my picture on and it just goes behind it, you can still see the torches and his silver Aeolian name.

Does anybody know how I can remove his background of the torches and his name?

Go to Your Client &gt; Files &gt; Client Files &gt; Cache &gt; Sprites<br>
Then look for the Image that has the spay paint through those pictures + folders and delete it, then compile.<br>
That’s all.<br>
Good luck.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t have those files.</p>
