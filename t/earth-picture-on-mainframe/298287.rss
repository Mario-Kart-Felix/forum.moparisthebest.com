    <description>Hi everyone, i got a big hard question for you all. I was wondering, i added the globe thing onto my mainframe, and i was wondering how to make it a button? Do i have to make it a separate .PNG file in my interface or spirts folder? and also mess around with Class30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub1.java? Please answer soon. I need as much help as possible in a short amount of time. I will try to fame you in some way. oops. i mean rep. Also, if this isnt in the right section, can a moderator please not lock it?
