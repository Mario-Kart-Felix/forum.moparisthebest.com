    <description>This is basically the same concept as Dharoks in Rs2. If you are under 50% of health increases your max hit; under 40 increases your max more: 30, 20, and finally under 10% allows you to hit up to 66.

Must be wearing the 4 piece set ( large--plate--legs--axe ) or your bonus will return to regular stats.

I put the test spam in the video to show you where it is at in the script. I made it to where it only updates your max hit if you are in combat, or switching weps. I Did have it update all around, but it got some stacking glitchs with the max hit so changed it up for now.

Basically I am just doing it for fun and to try and get better, nothing serious. like\hate\rate

Also, there is another mini-game I made. (i&#39;ll post it up tomorrow, I need to get back to school work.) If you didn&#39;t notice in the vids, Catfish was the food I used.  

If you live in kansas you know river fishing is the deal, so I made river fishing on here. You can walk on the water on rivers only, and random fishing objects spawn at random parts on the water for 1 minute before switching to a new place. It requires 90 fishing and Fishing Gloves.</description>

              <p>Thanks for all the comments. I’m currently attending college and due to the fact that I’m running off their router I cannot port forward. So I have no intention on going public with this. When I’m finished I’ll probably release it to some one who wants to use it. Atm I am just trying to finish up my to-do list that I had made while trying to entertain myself during a theology Lecture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clan System ( working on it )</li>
<li>Vengeance ( done )</li>
<li>Telewalk outside of wild 90+mage &amp; consumes runes ( Done but can only use in certain areas)</li>
<li>Barrows set ( done )</li>
<li>Unlimited arrows with crystal bow &amp; half range speed ( done )</li>
<li>Slayer ( not done but it’ll be the last thing I do since I can just continue off yongs task )</li>
<li>4\13 quests ( done )</li>
<li>Rings ( Done ) ~ Sapph increases magic xp if in inv, emerald tele’s pvp\cw, ruby increases mining, diamond = r.o.l on rs2, wealth Gives you 10% chance to craft extra runes while runecrafting</li>
</ul>
<p>-Courtroom(90% Done) ~ Basically A new way for banning\Judging ect. Its an event so people can only enter the court room while its in session</p>
<p>-Healing (done)</p>
<p>-Raids | Zamorak can kill once a week | Satan once a day | and Minion just has a 1 hour respawn | (done)</p>
<p>Game Objects ( No where near done )</p>
<p>Landscape (95%ish)</p>
<p>Castlewars ( done but I need to look at how to make an array list so the lobby’s will tele all players, and at the end of game aswell. ) ~ Made it just like rs2, only it has 2 maps so its not the same place, the one looks very simular to rs2, Other is a re-created map of shilow Village, using the two sides.</p>
<p>-Wild Tele ( Not done~Arraylist) basically made automatical teleports in wild that tele to another wild location every 15 seconds if you’re standing on the platform, but it only tele’s one person right now. Pretty much its just like those tele things in rs2 wild.</p>
<p>~Handfishing (Done)</p>
<p>~Zamoraks Fortress ( Not done ) Its a new mini game which I think is my favorite now, its completley origional just got to get some time to finish it up.</p>
<p>Other then that just basic xml stuff to finish. landscape\objects\few more npcs. I’m just doing this for a hobby, but I am a very task oriented person; so I try to make things perfect while doing so. When I do finish I’ll probobly just release it and if anyone likes it they can use it for their own server. If not well maybe some one can use it for ideas. I’m not the greatest at coding but I’m trying. I Started off with out any knolledge, Opened up note pad and began reading through all the scripts Yong had made back in noobscape 2. After a couple hours of reading it I started to see the structure, and he gave me some side tips on the way which I really appreciate. Imo it’s a fun hobby, so i’m going to stick with it &amp; see where it goes. I’ve seen some of the stuff Xent, peter, oldrscpker, yong-min, Adamn, &amp; kryptic have done and it amazes me. Definately something I’d like to learn on my spair time.</p>

Make a player sent message, " You head butt your opponent " " You knocked him out" Lol… Actually I changed the helmet’s “feathers?” to white on the sprite so that it’d match the armour, but i got bored of entering in the shifts so I just left it at that. I’ll enter the shifts in later haha. But thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Lol never knew how to quote on here, anyways I kinda did. Its armour defense is equal to mithril, with high attack, and the weapon str bonus is only 20. All based on being under 50% health, but even at that you can get 2 hit pretty easily with low def bonus and under 50%. You know them kids back in the day 3 iteming with full rune protecting large. would love this with a str ammy and str pot <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I got so lucky on the end of that video, should of died on the last hit, ran and i’m like screw it gonna try it. pointed out the max hit calc at “66” then 2 hits him with 55 dead lol.</p>
<p>Anyways, thanks for the comments though I appreciate it :), atm i’m messing around with mudclient before I get back to work. Trying to make a clan chat system like on rs2. Ultimately so it’ll show who’s online in clan and so you can message them. So far got the clientside done about to try writing something up on server side now.</p>
<p>If I get that to work i’m gonna try making it so the clan leader can add and remove clan members just like with the friends list add\remove. Then maybe even ranks to allow people to do that. but for now i’ll take it one step at a time. Really loving coding, its so identicle to working on cars, only free <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
