    <title>Does nobody know what to do? male/female wielding visual issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-nobody-know-what-to-do-male-female-wielding-visual-issues/311000</link>
    <description>im currently using a 317 prodigyscape base and am trying to add a few customs. 
i am trying to add the fallen angel for anyone who knows it and i think i have done everything right in that
i added the model and the ints in class 8 are all correct. the compiler compiles everything correctly and i use the &quot;add model&quot; command.

the problem is i log in and the weapon shows up correctly in my inventory and when i drop it but when wielded it shows up as some other weapon or shape. i checked and doubled checked int&#39;s 165 and 200 which are for wielding and nothing seems wrong.

does anyone have an idea what might be wrong? any help would be very much appreciated.</description>
