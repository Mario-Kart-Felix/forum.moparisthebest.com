[size=18pt][b]Welcome to Project Skibblez[/b][/size]

[hr][hr]

Our server has no name as of the moment, [b]we are open for suggestions.[/b] It will be referred to as PS or Project Skibblez until so. In the event we do get a server name, the thread, and some parts will still be called Project Skibblez because it is a project, but the server overall will be called the new name.

[b][anchor=team]The Team:[/anchor][/b]

Currently, I&#39;m the only member of team Skibblez. I have set up some forums for this server using SMF. I&#39;ll be working on getting approval for that shortly. I Sk8rdude461, am the leader, web designer, and project manager of this team. My job is to make the website, keep it healthy, work on the server, edit the server, add content, dispatch updates, etc. Yeah, I do a lot.

Webdesign/Developers:
1.Sk8rdude461

Server Programmers:
1. Sk8rdude461
2. (open)

Forum Moderators:
None. This will be based off how many people join and are active on the forums.

Game Moderators:
None. There will be no moderators added in-game until we get to at least the beta phase.

Note: Game/Forum staff will NOT be picked here, there will be no application for it. They will be hand picked by the staff and Administration on Project Skibblez.

[shadow=black,right]All Members Areas blocked[/shadow] (40%)
Melee (80%)
Mage(80%)
Range(80%)
Quests(3%)
Other Content (5-20%)

Blocking members areas is fast and simple, it allows us to focus on making the F2P features as best as possible. Once we get them up to optimal performance, we will work on P2P code.

[anchor=faq][b]Frequently Asked Questions[/b][/anchor]:
[/center]
1. You&#39;re making a P2P zone, does that mean players will have to pay to play? No, this server will always be free. Donations, however, will always be accepted; but they will not be pushed upon players. No player will receive some advantage because they did donate. Cosmetics might be handed out though.
2. Why are the P2P Zones being blocked? So we can concentrate on the free zones, giving you the best content we can, before focusing on the pay to play content.
3. You have an age requirement, why? It&#39;s there not because I despise young, immature, people. It&#39;s because most people 18 or over have a head on their shoulders, and know more, in general, then someone younger than 18, or 17.
4. You&#39;re not even 18 yet, why do you have a limit set higher than your age? Well, because I&#39;m close to being 18, so the limit is rather realistic.
5. Is this going to end up like all the other F2P 06 remakes? No, this server is being made for fun and entertainment, not to profit, or bring content back for nostalgia.

[/center]</p>
<ol>
<li>You’re making a P2P zone, does that mean players will have to pay to play? No, this server will always be free. Donations, however, will always be accepted; but they will not be pushed upon players. No player will receive some advantage because they did donate. Cosmetics might be handed out though.</li>
<li>Why are the P2P Zones being blocked? So we can concentrate on the free zones, giving you the best content we can, before focusing on the pay to play content.</li>
<li>You have an age requirement, why? It’s there not because I despise young, immature, people. It’s because most people 18 or over have a head on their shoulders, and know more, in general, then someone younger than 18, or 17.</li>
<li>You’re not even 18 yet, why do you have a limit set higher than your age? Well, because I’m close to being 18, so the limit is rather realistic.</li>
<li>Is this going to end up like all the other F2P 06 remakes? No, this server is being made for fun and entertainment, not to profit, or bring content back for nostalgia.<br>
