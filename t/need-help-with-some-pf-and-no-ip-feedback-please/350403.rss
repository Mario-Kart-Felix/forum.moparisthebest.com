    <title>Need help with some PF and no-ip feedback please</title>

    <description>Ok, me and my friend are makign a RSPS and need to port-foward.  I know there is lots of guides on this subject, but, I cannot seem to find one on a Belkin Router.  We have already attempted to port foward his IP address.  We have put the port 43594 in the column under Inbound Port which looks like [___]-[___] and under Private Port [___]-[___].  We also didn&#39;t know if the type is TCP, UDP or both.  We also have the question about No-Ip.  The IP that we are going to use for our server which is for ex: zoparscape.no-ip.org.  We tried portfowarding and it seemed to work so we used that IP and it would not connect.  If there is a TUT on this please post a link.  We would really like some feedback :).</description>
