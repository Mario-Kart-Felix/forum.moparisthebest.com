[code]
Initializing...
Compiling core classes.. Step 1 of 1...
Player.java:781: cannot find symbol
symbol  : method isFullHelm(int)
location: class Item
      if (!Item.isFullHelm(playerEquipment[playerHat]) &amp;&amp; !Item.isFullMask(playe
rEquipment[playerHat]) &amp;&amp;(playerLook[0] != 1)) {
               ^

I had alot more errors with the code and these 2 are the only that remains. Help would be very much appreciated. The code looks fine to me I can&#39;t see anything out of place yet it decides it still wan&#39;ts to be hell. :P[br][size=1]Posted on: 04 October 2007, 20:58:18[/size][hr]Ah fixed it!

[code]if (!Item.isFullHelm(playerEquipment[playerHat]) &amp;&amp; !Item.isFullMask(playerEquipment[playerHat]) &amp;&amp;(playerLook[0] != 1)) {[/code]

It should of been.

[code]if (!Item.isFullHelm(playerEquipment[playerHat]) &amp;&amp; !Item4.isFullMask(playerEquipment[playerHat]) &amp;&amp;(playerLook[0] != 1)) {[/code]

Just incase for those who wanted to know how I fixed it. :)
