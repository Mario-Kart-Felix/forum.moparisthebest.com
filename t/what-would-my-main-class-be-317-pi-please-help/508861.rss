    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-would-my-main-class-be-317-pi-please-help/508861</link>
    <description>in my run.bat it has   

@echo off
title Running Project Old School
java -Xmx256m Jframe 10 0 highmem members 32
pause

in the tuts i read it says in the run.bat it should specify what the main-class would be like it should say client ive seen example i have jarred other clients correctly just this one wont work i upload it to my site using the client for main-class and it does download the cache and it unzips it correctly but after it unzips it it gives connection error because i even used and unjarred client me and my friend and it loads the same cache that the webclient uses no problem. Please help thanks in advanced</description>
