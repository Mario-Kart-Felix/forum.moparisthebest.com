    <title>Players cannot connect to my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/players-cannot-connect-to-my-server/455142</link>
    <description>I successfully portforwarded, set up a no-ip, made an exception in my firewall, and my friend was able to play on my server for around 2 days. The next day my ip changed on no-ip and then he started having problems connecting to my server and I tried on my brothers computer and I was not able to connect on that computer either. Do I have to make my ip static on no-ip or what? Im kind of a noob with these kind of things so help would be great. Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Also I have tried on a few different sources and clients to make sure it wasnt just the one. Thanks</description>

              <p>thanks i thought i needed a static ip but it was never mentioned in any of the youtube guides i used to make the server and since it worked at first i figured i did everything but i guess on the videos it was assumed i already had a static ip</p>

              <p>Things to do or check<br>
Change your old ip in the client to the new one compile &amp; upload, release it.<br>
Have your source running then go to <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> and see if it says that it can see your service if not you need to make a static ip and portforward again.</p>
