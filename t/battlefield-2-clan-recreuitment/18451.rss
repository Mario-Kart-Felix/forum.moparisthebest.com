    <description>Anyone interested in joining a battlefield 2 clan?

It&#39;s so easy to join. Here are the steps:
1. Goto www.greatwallofgaming.com
2. Enter the Forums
3. register
4. Scroll down to the &#39;GWOG Australian BF2 Clan&#39; section
5. Goto the recruitment section
6. Ask to be in the clan
7. wait for about a day or less
8. And you are done.
9. Now visit the website again after a day or so and get told when to put the tag on and you will be welcomed.

We all stay together never letting a soilder behind. We all co-operate with mics to enhance the battle. We learn eachother as we fight and we always... always have a good time...

At the moment we only have a few people, hoping we can recruit more, I, as a captain of GWOG, join this forum to Recruit people who are finding a clan to join. So why not join ours? we have friendly members and a forum to chat to eachother.

well ive done my talking, its up to you guys to join the squad
