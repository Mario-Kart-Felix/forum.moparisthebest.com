    <title>Error while running NetBeans</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-while-running-netbeans/116950</link>
    <description>Well this isnt a error from my code its a problem with netbeans, It shows a error message in the bottom left and says something about a null pointer and to report it to the manufacturers so i totally uninstalled it and re-installed it and it did it again, it runs really slow, its the ONLY slow thing on my comp. If you open a window then close it netbeans turns grey and then you have to move your mouse over stuff for it to be visible again.. Anyone had this happen?</description>
