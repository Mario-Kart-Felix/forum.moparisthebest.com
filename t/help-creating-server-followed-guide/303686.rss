    <title>Help creating server, followed guide</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-creating-server-followed-guide/303686</link>
    <description>im new to this creating of servers but i have followed a guide on the moparscape forums. i used the versatile client and server and got it running but i do not understand how all the portforwarding and no-ip hosting stuff is connected to the rest and am not sure how to allow people onto the server. 

if someone could please help in telling me th basics of how i let people on and how they even find a palce to download the client.
along with possible basics in coding or a link to where i could find such a thing.

thanks,
ryan</description>

              <p>Ok, first if you do not have a router then do not worry about port forwarding, if you do have a router, then goto start &gt; run &gt; cmd and type in “ipconfig” then look for your default gateway and ip address, type the default gateway in the URL and then sign in as user:“admin” pass:“admin” if you have not changed it, then goto wherever you manage your ports and open port 43594, or whatever port you want your server to be on, protocol just use both, and for ip address, put it what is said in command prompt, they might already have some of the numbers there, just type in what they left out.</p>
<p>Then, register an account with no-ip, make a host and name it what you want your server to be called. then download their DUC.</p>
<p>Open that up and make sure that your ip address is online, then just run the server, and if you did everything correctly then you should be able to log on to your server, and that includes other people.</p>
<p>Hope this helped, if you want me to make a short video showing how to do it, just let me know and I’ll see if I have some extra time on my hands.</p>
