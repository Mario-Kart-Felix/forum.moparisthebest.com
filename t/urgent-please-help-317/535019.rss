    <description>MY client&#39;s, crown system is messed up, and i cant figure out how to make each crown show in the right spots.

Currently all crowns show the right crown to other players
mod works fully with pm and and all

Admin&#39;s show owner crown for that player but admin for others-pm&#39;s show owner

Owner works for both, but pm&#39;s show donor

and donors, show admin for that player, but show donor for others, and pm are invisible.


If anyone is willing, to Teamview me, i would, and the rest of my developers, would greatly, appriecated, it., and i will give, massive thanks, and credits. Please help this is urgent, and i need this done fast.

Theres only one section that uses &quot;cr&quot; in client.java and that is configured right. Please help

I&#39;ve checked at all tut,s etc, and none of them fit, what i have</description>
