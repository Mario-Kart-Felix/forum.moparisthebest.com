    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-finally-got-a-question-i-cant-answer-xd/152359</link>
    <description>Ok well as you know I own hiyascape server and I run it off my dads computer which has a router for my brothers ps3 and I port forwarded the router and im sad because people can&#39;t get on my server at my moms house because she has DSL and im at her house most of the time, so when I go to my default it shows me no port forwarding,and as I heard some people said you don&#39;t have to port forward with dsl so  
I just trusted them and downloaded my source so then I compile and run it and no one can get on so I went in DUC and clicked boxes and let those work so it updated and then I opened my port through my modem and no one can get on still and I can log on the 0.0.0.0 and the 127.0.0.1 and play but no one can get on help please ;)</description>
