    <description>[center][size=14pt]Just a bunch of crazy news! It&#39;s nuts![/size][/center]

Since I read the news daily, I summarized each of these articles for you in case you don&#39;t want to read each one. Pretty good articles though. ;) Just pick an article, they are all very interesting.

[b]Article: [url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060629/od_nm/pakistan_bulb_dc]Operation removes lightbulb from anus[/url][/b]
Mohammad from Pakistan said he woke up last weekend with a lightbulb in his anus. Doctors removed it from his anus after a 1 and a half hour operation without breaking the bulb. Mohammad swore he didn&#39;t know the lightbulb was in there. Obviously what happened was that Mohammad and Mohammad got into a fight with each other and one of them said, &quot;I&#39;m going to stick that lightbulb up your ass!&quot;. And of course the other said, &quot;Bring it on!&quot;.


[b]Article: [url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060630/ap_on_re_us/disney_death]Autopsy: Boy at Disney had heart defect[/url][/b]
In Orlando, Florida in Disney World, a 12-year-old boy died of a heart attack from a roller coaster. The kid didn&#39;t fall out, he just couldn&#39;t take the Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll Rollercoaster ride. The body was not meant to get their brain rattled even though we consider it fun when we go to Six Flags or Disney World. An autopsy was done of course which brought us to the conclusion that it was indeed a heart attack.


[b]Article: [url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060630/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq_soldiers_investigated]U.S. Troops accused of killing Iraq family[/url][/b]
Five soldiers in the U.S. Army have killed 4 Iraqi relatives. A body was found of a woman who had been raped before being murdered. This is, according to the article, the sixth time Iraqui civilians were slain for no reason by the U.S. Army. The five soldiers tried to burn the body of the woman to get rid of the evidence. Unfortunately for them, that information also leaked out and these soldiers will get fucked.  


[b]Article: [url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060628/ap_on_re_us/indecent_exposure]Awkward moments abound in penis pump trial[/url][/b]
Yes... Yes.. In the conservative parts of Oklahoma, a judge is convicted with indecent exposure because that motherfucker lol actually hahaha used a Penis Pump in a trial! Hahahahaha!! &quot;Over the past few days, the jurors have watched a defense attorney and a prosecutor pantomime masturbation. A doctor has lectured on the lengths the defendant was willing to go to enhance his sexual performance. The white-handled sexual device sits before the jury box for hours at a time. Occasionally an attorney picks it up and squeezes the handle, demonstrating the &quot;sh-sh&quot; sound of air rushing through the contraption&#39;s plastic tubing.&quot; LOL! This guy is a character.


[b]Article: [url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060630/ts_nm/rights_mexico_dc]Mexican ex-president ordered arrested in massacre[/url][/b]
In Mexico City today, a judge ordered the arrest of Mexico&#39;s former President Luis Echeverria for a 1968 student massacre in a surprise move just two days before a presidential election. The judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence to prove that Echeverria had committed genocide. Echeverria is 84. Because of his age, he is expected to be under house arrest because of his age. Then again.. it is Mexico! 


[b]Article: [url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060630/ap_on_go_pr_wh/new_nukes]White House ponders NG nuclear warheads[/url][/b]
Since many of the nuclear warheads were built and designed around 40 years ago, their plutonium and other compounds seemed to have broken down in ways researchers do not fully understand. This is a pretty big thread to the US since we have around... 5,000 nuclear war heads and Bush also broke that treaty with Russia and has now continued to make more such as the new Neutron Bomb which doesn&#39;t destroy the buildings... IT JUST FUCKING KILLS EVERYONE. *Clap* *Clap* I sure feel safe.

What a Neutron Bomb does is kill everyone and leave the buildings standing by radiation. BUT! Unlike a Nuclear Bomb, a Neutron Bomb&#39;s radiation will last about a day. Where as a Nuclear Bomb&#39;s radiation lasts 200 years!


Like I said... crazy news!

<p>Oh woops I made a mistake. What a Neutron Bomb does is kill everyone and leave the buildings standing by radiation. BUT! Unlike a Nuclear Bomb, a Neutron Bomb’s radiation will last about a day. Where as Nuclear Bomb’s radiation lasts 200 years! I’ll edit the first post. Sorry about that.</p>

<p>Since I read the news daily, I summarized each of these articles for you in case you don’t want to read each one. Pretty good articles though. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Just pick an article, they are all very interesting.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Article: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060629/od_nm/pakistan_bulb_dc" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Operation removes lightbulb from anus</a></span><br>
Mohammad from Pakistan said he woke up last weekend with a lightbulb in his anus. Doctors removed it from his anus after a 1 and a half hour operation without breaking the bulb. Mohammad swore he didn’t know the lightbulb was in there. Obviously what happened was that Mohammad and Mohammad got into a fight with each other and one of them said, “I’m going to stick that lightbulb up your ass!”. And of course the other said, “Bring it on!”.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Article: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060630/ap_on_re_us/disney_death" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Autopsy: Boy at Disney had heart defect</a></span><br>
In Orlando, Florida in Disney World, a 12-year-old boy died of a heart attack from a roller coaster. The kid didn’t fall out, he just couldn’t take the Rock’n’Roll Rollercoaster ride. The body was not meant to get their brain rattled even though we consider it fun when we go to Six Flags or Disney World. An autopsy was done of course which brought us to the conclusion that it was indeed a heart attack.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Article: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060630/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq_soldiers_investigated" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">U.S. Troops accused of killing Iraq family</a></span><br>
Five soldiers in the U.S. Army have killed 4 Iraqi relatives. A body was found of a woman who had been raped before being murdered. This is, according to the article, the sixth time Iraqui civilians were slain for no reason by the U.S. Army. The five soldiers tried to burn the body of the woman to get rid of the evidence. Unfortunately for them, that information also leaked out and these soldiers will get fucked.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Article: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060628/ap_on_re_us/indecent_exposure" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Awkward moments abound in penis pump trial</a></span><br>
Yes… Yes… In the conservative parts of Oklahoma, a judge is convicted with indecent exposure because that motherfucker lol actually hahaha used a Penis Pump in a trial! Hahahahaha!! “Over the past few days, the jurors have watched a defense attorney and a prosecutor pantomime masturbation. A doctor has lectured on the lengths the defendant was willing to go to enhance his sexual performance. The white-handled sexual device sits before the jury box for hours at a time. Occasionally an attorney picks it up and squeezes the handle, demonstrating the “sh-sh” sound of air rushing through the contraption’s plastic tubing.” LOL! This guy is a character.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Article: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060630/ts_nm/rights_mexico_dc" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Mexican ex-president ordered arrested in massacre</a></span><br>
In Mexico City today, a judge ordered the arrest of Mexico’s former President Luis Echeverria for a 1968 student massacre in a surprise move just two days before a presidential election. The judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence to prove that Echeverria had committed genocide. Echeverria is 84. Because of his age, he is expected to be under house arrest because of his age. Then again… it is Mexico!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Article: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060630/ap_on_go_pr_wh/new_nukes" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">White House ponders NG nuclear warheads</a></span><br>

This is a pretty big thread to the US since we have around… 5,000 nuclear war heads and Bush also broke that treaty with Russia and has now continued to make more such as the new Neutron Bomb which doesn’t destroy the buildings… IT JUST FUCKING KILLS EVERYONE. <em>Clap</em> <em>Clap</em> I sure feel safe.</p>
<p>What a Neutron Bomb does is kill everyone and leave the buildings standing by radiation. BUT! Unlike a Nuclear Bomb, a Neutron Bomb’s radiation will last about a day. Where as a Nuclear Bomb’s radiation lasts 200 years!</p>
<p>Like I said… crazy news!</p>
