    <title>Oh wow...!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/oh-wow/147472</link>
    <description>Well i was looking around moparscape, then looked in the download section and decided to download and have a look at one of the current servers, so i downloaded it, saw the 1.1mb [b]&quot;Client.java&quot;[/b] had to look in it, first thing i found was this:
[url=http://javacisnotrecognized.com/pastebin/index.php?pv=view&amp;id=163]I can&#39;t even paste it into this post its that big takes a few seconds to load because its that big =\[/url]
Basically this backs up the theory of &quot;over crammed class&#39;s cause the server to lag&quot;, i posted this on this site because i knew you lot would get a good laugh out of this and would probably cause a good discussion, don&#39;t start posting all this &#39;keep it on moparscape&#39; because there are two reasons i can&#39;t do that 

[ul][li]Most of the people on there think its fine, and normal[/li]
[li]There is no general section over there[/li][/ul]

Even still like i said i posted this over here because i knew you lot would get a good laugh out of this and could cause a good discussion on the state of runescape private servers at the moment.

The Un-named went all hilter and moved this to the java section

That’s what happens when ‘tutorials’ are permitted. Take a look at RSC - it, for the most part, isn’t overran by morons, and the ones that used RSCD for the base are pretty reasonable.<br>

RSCD is just as bad. But making fun of private servers is getting old, and although it can be funny remember that everyone here was like that at some point. :P[/quote]<br>
RSCD base is wonderful, if you’ve ever actually looked at it.<br>
Very structural, very modular, very readable.</p>

              <p>Well i was looking around moparscape, then looked in the download section and decided to download and have a look at one of the current servers, so i downloaded it, saw the 1.1mb <span class="bbcode-b">“Client.java”</span> had to look in it, first thing i found was this:<br>
[url=http://javacisnotrecognized.com/pastebin/index.php?pv=view&amp;id=163]I can’t even paste it into this post its that big takes a few seconds to load because its that big =[/url]<br>
Basically this backs up the theory of “over crammed class’s cause the server to lag”, i posted this on this site because i knew you lot would get a good laugh out of this and would probably cause a good discussion, don’t start posting all this ‘keep it on moparscape’ because there are two reasons i can’t do that</p>
<p>[ul][li]Most of the people on there think its fine, and normal[/li]<br>
[li]There is no general section over there[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Even still like i said i posted this over here because i knew you lot would get a good laugh out of this and could cause a good discussion on the state of runescape private servers at the moment.</p>
<p>The Un-named went all hilter and moved this to the java section<br>
