    <description>The title says it all basically. Hah. Most of these will probably, in your opinion...stink. Keep in mind, most of these were [size=24pt]A WHILE AGO[/size] here they are though. If someone wants something I will make the mqo stickied to this topic...you can put it in your client from there...Just credit me.

[size=18pt]Gore Reaper (Or a new dragon scim O_O)[/size]

Who cares about this model&#39;s poly count...its a gag.

[size=18pt] No-Name Sword - old model, real old. [/size]

Low poly count.

[size=18pt] No-Name Axe - old model, more new than previous though. [/size]
