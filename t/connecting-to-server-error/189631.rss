    <title>Connecting to server error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connecting-to-server-error/189631</link>
    <description>Hello. I am in the same room as my brother with two different computers. I am hosting a server but he cannot connect, I have allowed port 43594 through my windows firewall, portfowarded it through my router and set up no-ip DUC. 

Is there something i&#39;m doing wrong?
