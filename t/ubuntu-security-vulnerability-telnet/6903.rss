    <title>Ubuntu Security Vulnerability: telnet</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ubuntu-security-vulnerability-telnet/6903</link>
    <description>Telnet has been a constant security vulnerability in every OS. It&#39;s supposed to be a feature, but hackers have been known to get by this, even in Linux. If you want some extra security follow these setsp to disable telnet.

Click on System &gt; Administration &gt; Synaptic Packet Manager

Find telnet and right click on it. Then click on Mark for Complete Removal. If you still need telnet for whatever reason, enable telnet -ssl which is telnet with encryption support. :)

Hope that helps. Ubuntu has very few vulnerabiltiies, and this one was small. If someone did get in, they could see your files in your user folder, but they couldn&#39;t get in as root.</description>
