    <title>Reason for arrays?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reason-for-arrays/468207</link>
    <description>So all I understand about them is they are more &#39;&#39;efficient.&quot; I don&#39;t know what causes the efficiency either as I usually use Enums over Arrays in situations like skills and emotes, but when I just need them to hold data to loop through I use them. I want to know how exactly they are better and why they are better. I loop different arrays to load on each initialization for each person logging in and was wondering is this going to cause any memory issues?

I&#39;ve been able to achieve this using arrays and a few if statement checks.

<p>sometimes, but not necessarily. a common misconception among moparscapers is about efficiency and it seems like hardly any of you seem to really understand it at all. using a for loop versus performing each statement individually isn’t necessarily faster. yes, it might be indeed better practice but no, not any faster.</p>
<p>for starters if you are interested in efficiency (which i probably don’t think you are but just incase), you could read up on the big O notation: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation</a></p>
<p>and i also dislike the fact that you are comparing apples to oranges. why not compare two similar objects with an actual similarity, such as arrays and arraylists? then you could easily debate on design patterns and whatnot.</p>

[/quote]No, I am confident with how I use enums. I want to know whats behind the arrays. I use them just for looks and its easier listing numbers in 1 array, strings in another array and then using a loop and one line of code to do it instead of 100 lines. Saves space. :P[/quote]</p>
<p>then perhaps you should read how arrays are handled in memory. it’s a very simple concept that i think even you can comprehend perfectly. if you are so interested in how they <em>work</em>, why not read it up? here is one explanation which i think you may find fairly useful: <a href="http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus5/html/page82.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus5/html/page82.html</a></p>

              <p>I always find that people will always argue the pros and cons of what’s more efficient.

I wouldn’t worry over minute efficiency differences if I was you, unless you’re doing something major (networking, entity updating etc.).</p>

              <p>er well I could be wrong cause I am an idiot but I am pretty sure enums are better than arrays.</p>
<p>True though, you won’t see a real difference most likely in rsps related items at least cause it doesn’t haven’t to search for that many items.</p>
<p>with an array string it would have to go through the string until it ended or found whatever.</p>
<p>with an enum it’s going to somewhat “hop” to it if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>Does that make sense cutie? &lt;3</p>
<p>Lesson <span class="hashtag">#2:</span> hashmaps…o wait</p>
<p>but seriously, I am not sure how true this is or not but I believe somehow enums are static in a sense (somebody confirm/deny ~^ ) IF it is true, then it may not be best to use an enum for whatever type of grouping your doing.</p>
<p>keep in mind that an array is a group of same items(i.e. pickaxes) while enums are different (i.e. slayer monsters ) So they both have their respective uses</p>
