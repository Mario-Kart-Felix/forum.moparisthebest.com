    <description>I want to start a team on a development of nazi zombies,

What this is , is a mini game and when your at the mini game hordes of zombies attack, and they get stronger and more hp every round and the maximum rounds is 50 and you can only bring a invt of food nothing else

Even if your a admin you cant spawn in there.

If this is in the wrong place please move it.</description>
