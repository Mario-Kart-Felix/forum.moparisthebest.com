    <title>Writing a Book</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/writing-a-book/387212</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve always been a huge fan of reading and writing, and I have many times attempted to write a story.  Thing is, I can never seem to actually finish a story, as I get horrible writers block and quit.

Anyways, does anyone have any tips on how to continue with a story without getting writers block, or perhaps even a topic I could take and write on?

I have been suggested a few topics by friends at school, most of them dumb, except for a book having something to do with shadows being killed (more to it, not posting).

Note: I do always have a notebook plus extra paper on me, so if I get an idea I can write it down so I don&#39;t forget.

              <p>I started writing a story in like fifth grade, it was fun to do. If you get writers block, start thinking about things that have happened in your life, and how you can change them to fit your story. Or think about things you do/don’t want to happen in your life.</p>

              <p>I’ve tried that, sorry I forgot to mention it.  Problem is, when I wake up, I have completely lost my train of thought.<br>
Perhaps I should stick to short stories and make them little series.  I can usually write 15-20 pages before I am out of ideas.</p>
