    <title>[508] Drop Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-drop-help/260207</link>
    <description>I first realized this when my friend came on a server I am making. I was killing the monsters but he was getting the drop. Even when he was nowhere near me. It printed this on run.bat.

[code]
Exception dropping item:
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 1
[/code]

Tell me what&#39;s wrong and how to fix it please.</description>
