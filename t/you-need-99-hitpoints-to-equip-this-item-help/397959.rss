    <title>&quot;You need 99 hitpoints to equip this item.&quot; Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/you-need-99-hitpoints-to-equip-this-item-help/397959</link>
    <description>So this is a most common problem that people may have using 317 servers. When you have less than 99 hitpoints but have a LEVEL of 99 hitpoints, it comes up with &quot;You need 99 hitpoints to equip this item.&quot; So I searched up in client.java &quot;to equip this item&quot; and I found this 
[code]            if (playerLevel[playerHitpoints] - CLHitpoints &lt; 0) {
                sendMessage(
                        &quot;You need &quot; + CLHitpoints + &quot; &quot;
                        + statName[playerHitpoints] + &quot; to equip this item.&quot;);
                GoFalse = true;
            }[/code]
Now from the code above, I would want instead of the hitpoints you are currently on, the Xp you are currently on. (not typed clearly but for example: I have 69/99 hitpoints and I want to equip the hitpoints skillcape and it comes up with that message.)
It will be great if some one can reply on how I can fix this. I would give rep if I can but I can only give rep at 15 rep :(</description>
