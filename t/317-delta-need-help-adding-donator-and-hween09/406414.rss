    <title>[317][delta] need help adding donator and hween09</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-need-help-adding-donator-and-hween09/406414</link>
    <description>ok im lost, i dont know what possible thing i could do to fix this but, i want to add the titles donator and hween09, i have deleted all my current characters (just in case) i have the title &quot;ismem&quot; so i searched ismem in client and under it i copied that code and pasted 2 more renaming ismem, hween09 and donator, i did this throughout the entire file i also did this in player and player handler. what else can i do, i have a command that requires you to be hween09 in order to use and it keeps saying (when i compile) variable not found. what file would i have to edit to fix this. (i kept the same order on each it is, ismem, then donator then hween09.)

thanks</description>
