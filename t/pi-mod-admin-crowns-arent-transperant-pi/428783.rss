    <description>Hey guys, so i was tired of gay costums crowns the server had, so i decided to replace them with the normal runescape ones

so i dled the crowns, but coudln&#39;t edit them in photoshop for a reason :S

anyways so i did it in paint with that purple background, and it shows purple background ingame....

anyone knows how to get that away??

and does it work if i make a print screen of a crown copy paste them in photoshop deleting background and save as a .png  will that work on a client??</description>
