You ban people for placing signs on a game saying that they built some virtual house made out of blocks? That’s awesome. I lol’d.<br>

<p>Here’s the story:</p>

<p>I obliged; and like he said, it was pretty bad. I pulled out my trusty stick (which is the tool I use to check the logs) and went around right clicking destroyed blocks. They were ALL from you ‘[Time/Date] asaineblade destroyed block COBBLESTONE’ etc. I also checked your IP, it matched all previous IP’s you had used, so it wasn’t some random person on your account. This is good enough proof - so I used my rollback command to rollback an amazing 2000+ changes you had made, then banned you.</p>
<p>Just because you know nobody was there, doesn’t mean we have no proof.</p>

<p>The logs tells Davidi2 exactly who did what, and possibly even when. You may not beleive it but oh well. Your user was the last one to touch something there, and he ip banned that user. Your ip happened to come up. Tuff shit and deal with your/brothers actions. (its always the brother in these situations)</p>

<p>Well, i asked david to show me the proofs, if he dont he aint has the fuckcing proof<br>
[/quote]<br>
MITB has the server, not Davidi2, the only way Davidi2 can get you proof is if MITB posted it. The moment you were ip banned it undoes everything you did.[/quote]</p>
<p>No, Davidi2 has full access to all username/IP logs, as well as he can get on the server and see the full history change for each block.</p>

<p>The logs tells Davidi2 exactly who did what, and possibly even when. You may not beleive it but oh well. Your user was the last one to touch something there, and he ip banned that user. Your ip happened to come up. Tuff shit and deal with your/brothers actions. (its always the brother in these situations)<br>

<p>Well, i asked david to show me the proofs, if he dont he aint has the fuckcing proof[/quote]<br>
MITB has the server, not Davidi2, the only way Davidi2 can get you proof is if MITB posted it. The moment you were ip banned it undoes everything you did.</p>

<p>They clearly have proof. You’re a terrible liar, so shut up. And tell me to ask someone that I can trust, how about?<br>

<p>K let me see the proof. I wanna see that fucking proof, though someone could have logged into my account(s)? well show the fucking proof. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>EDIT: on your pictures it says fam1s house… well im aint fam1s[/quote]<br>
Fixed.<br>
You’re trying to intimidate me, and it’s not working. And “someone else was on my account” is one of the worst excuses ever, almost as bad as “my brother registered on this comp and did bad stuff plzz unban my ip”.<br>
Also, asasine isn’t a word.<br>
And Davidi2 says you were griefing me, and the only griefing I spotted was done by fame1, and David has a plugin that can check who damaged what.<br>
Ask him for the proof.</p>
