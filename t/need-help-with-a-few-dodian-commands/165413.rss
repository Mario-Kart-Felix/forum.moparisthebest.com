              <p><code>if(command.toLowerCase().startsWith("giveprem") &amp;&amp; playerName.equalsIgnoreCase("Goddess"))
{
String noob = command.substring(9);
int index = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(noob);
if(index != -1)
{
client halp = (client) server.playerHandler.players[index];
halp.isMember = true; // replace this with your membership variable.
sendMessage("You have given "+halp.playerName+"premium status!");
halp.sendMessage(playerName+" has given you premium status!");
}
}</code></p>
<p>You should be able to make the other commands by basing them on this one.</p>
