    <title>562 Adding Party Drop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-adding-party-drop/429440</link>
    <description>I am using Emberscape 562 loading 604 what I am trying to do is getting the party drop working at the falador drop party room. On runelocus I found a tutorial added by Emily and I found out that she removed the tutorial for some reasons. The party room has everything in it but I can&#39;t add items to the chest it just wears them. Nothing happens when I pull the lever it just says &quot;W00T Party Drop&quot; Can someone help me plz?</description>
