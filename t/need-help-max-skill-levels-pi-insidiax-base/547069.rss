    <title>Need help Max skill levels [PI] InsidiaX base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-max-skill-levels-pi-insidiax-base/547069</link>
    <description>Hello guys,
I followed this tutorial to change the max skill level on my server and it doesn&#39;t work, it shows the skills 99/122
As in ( 99 out of 122) I set my max lvl as (122) it just show&#39;s but it doesn&#39;t actually work, you can&#39;t level up after 99.
Is there anything I can do to fix it?

Here&#39;s the tutorial I followed.
[CODE]
First, Assuming you&#39;ve a Source already, Go In your Source Folder and Search ( Ctrl + F ) &quot;PlayerAssistant.java&quot;

In It, Search for
Code: (Select All)
public int getLevelForXP(int exp) {

Right Below, You should see Something like
Code: (Select All)
public int getLevelForXP(int exp) {
int points = 0;
int output = 0;
if (exp &gt; &quot;XX&quot;)
return &quot;XX&quot;;
for (int lvl = 1; lvl &lt;= &quot;XX&quot;; lvl++) {

For Me, I Have This. ( They can Vary, but as long as u have simple knowledge, not hard to figure em out

Alright, Where it Says 
if (exp &gt; &quot;XX&quot;) Replace the &quot;XX&quot; With However much experience you want leading to the skill level,
Where you see &quot;for (int lvl = 1; lvl &lt;= ##; lvl++) {&quot; Replace The &quot;XX&quot;
And Where it says &quot;return &quot;XX&quot;, Replace those with the max level you want.[/size]



If you happened to not find the Code in playerassistant.java, Check in Client.Java And do the same thing. Goodluck

After You&#39;ve got that all finished, Close &amp; Compile.
[/CODE]
That&#39;s what I have done, I followed everything correctly, is there anything wrong with this?
Can someone help me, Thanks.</description>

That’s your problem.<br>
Might want to change that to the exp of whatever level you want as the max…<br>
<a href="http://www.tip.it/runescape/pages/view/xp_table.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">XP chart</a>[/quote]<br>
Yeah, I figured that out earlier today.<br>
Here’s the thing though, now it shows 99/122, it says I have 122 after getting the certain amount of exp needed /: I trained and got the exp to test it and it works but it should be saying like 100/122 or 101/122 but instead its like: 99/100 99/101 99/102 etc…<br>
How do I possibly fix this issue here?<br>
Thank you.</p>
