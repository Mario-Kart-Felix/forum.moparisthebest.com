    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/windows-08-r2-servers/544892</link>
    <description>Hey so i been using mopar scape forums for a while, but not lately at all. So i got sponsored by microsoft and now im given some free servers. I wont be using them so i wana sell them. You can renew them each month and basically i got these for 3 years. So if you wana pre pay or anything you can. I have a thread design and everything but before posting that i wanted to know if it would be of any intrest here since im selling them cheap it could help development i suppose &amp; also if its allowed. So it would be great to have clearence on this thanks for reading ;^].</description>
