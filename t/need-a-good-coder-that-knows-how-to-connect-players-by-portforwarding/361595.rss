              <p>Actually I had the same problem, and my bud helped with a thing called Uturrent or so called Bitturrent what is basically does it port-foward and opens the port 43594 for you. You can download this on google. Add me on msn if you need further help: <a href="mailto:Dildowillis@hotmail.com">Dildowillis@hotmail.com</a></p>
