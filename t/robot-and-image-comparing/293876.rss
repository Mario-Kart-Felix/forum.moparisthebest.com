    <title>Robot and image comparing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/robot-and-image-comparing/293876</link>
    <description>[s]Excuse the sarcastic title, but I seriously have no idea what its even called...[/s]

What I&#39;m trying to do is having an image on my computer (lets say of a star) .. and now I am trying to compare this image to find a similar star on my screen. How would I do this? Or at least what is it called (so I can google)? I&#39;ve tried searching with keywords like: pixel comparing picture screen finding area similar etc.

Closest thing to this I found was the  getPixelColor(int x, int y) method in the robot class, but I think some of the runescape bot programmers used image compared (unless I am wrong and theres no such thing)

Thanks for your help in advance :)</description>

<p>Yes, that is correct. Here are links to some documentations regarding the classes you are to use:</p>

<p>Or you could use <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/ImageIcon.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ImageIcon</a>. Some people may argue it’s easier to use, etc.</p>

<p>and thanks for your help I think now I have a path to do some research on this.</p>
<p>so as a summary, I load my image using javax.imageio.ImageIO.read(File), then buffer the screen and then read the pixels of the image to find the pattern and then look for that on the screen…is this correct?</p>

              <p>You can load the image with the method: [tt]javax.imageio.ImageIO.read(File)[/tt]. Then, as I said, you compare the screen’s pixels with the image’s. This, of course, will provide a tremendously slow application; although I’m not sure if speed is what you are looking for.</p>
<p>EDIT: Since it looks like you want the program to constantly be comparing the screen’s image with your image, and want to develop something similar to “runescape color bots”, I suggest you get the window handle of the window you suspect that will draw the same image as yours (such as the runscape client with runescape color bots), and capture an image of that window. Of course, I’m not so sure that java provides such flexibility with window-handles in general. If this is the case, I’d suggest you use JNI for a (relatively) fast application.</p>

              <p>but what if I already have the image in the program’s directory?</p>
<p>I know what my image looks like, its the screen I have to search on because I have to find the replica of the picture on the screen/page as it can change at any point. (or else i would’ve hardcoded mouseMove()&lt;3)</p>
<p>I think what you’re telling me is how to get the screen correct? how do I load the image I am comparing with?</p>
