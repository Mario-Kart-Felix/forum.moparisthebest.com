              <p>skills function, like back in 2005-2008, just you either forgot or don’t know the animations…</p>
<p>we forgot to point out that we were removing some skills and didn’t remove it fully. Like i stated 2 times we plan on making this “our own f2p point of view version” like adding custom npcs, items, weapons. etc. wait until the next versions <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The only skill that doesn’t function well is cooking, and fishing doesn’t do the animations.</p>
