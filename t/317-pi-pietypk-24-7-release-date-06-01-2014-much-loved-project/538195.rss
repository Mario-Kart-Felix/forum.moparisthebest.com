<p>thanks dude i will start working on this right away! i have no idea how i can gain players anyway  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>I actually joined and seems like a nice server , expect for a few bugs i noticed and some things need to be edited.</p>
<ul>
<li>When wearing a cape with the dragon platebody you can see it through the cape.</li>
<li>The exp rates are really too high , i got maxed a few stats in less than 15 minutes.</li>
<li>100m Starter wasnt a good idea , and since leveling is easy you get 99 thieving really easily therfore making too much money in just few minutes.<br>
-When trying to change hitmarks in options it doesn’t work the same hitmark is kept.</li>
<li>The current HP bar is not too good , it just doesn’t fit in neither look good.</li>
<li>You should try fixing the attack animations of monsters. The walking is good.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thats it so far , i hope you use my feedback to improve your server for the better  ;)[/quote]</p>
