    <title>Client won&#39;t connect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-wont-connect/458313</link>
    <description>Alright so, I&#39;ve been running my RSPS for about 2 weeks now and the client has always connected right away.
Well, I wanted to change the background so I did.  I uploaded the new cache and etc.

The client downloads the new cache and loads up completely fine, but now it just gives me the same old &quot;error connecting to server&quot; message.

What could have happened?

Also, I changed something in ItemDef.java so when you talked to the wise old man the client wouldn&#39;t crash.
But, that&#39;s not the problem because I even undid what I edited in it and it still doesn&#39;t work.

inb4&quot;DID YOU EVEN COMPILE?&quot;</description>
