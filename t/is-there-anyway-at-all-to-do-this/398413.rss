    <title>Is there anyway at all to do this?</title>

    <description>Hey guys!

Well, I&#39;m making a site for someone (via Forumotion) and sadly there&#39;s no ability to code PHP at the moment (I&#39;m just glad that it accepts both HTML and CSS...). So I was wondering if you could code the same thing that PHP would do but code it with HTML. In simple terms, I want to  convert PHP over to HTML with no PHP code in it. If someone could answer me and send me in the right direction of how to do this, that would be great! Thanks!
