    <title>How to create minecraft webclient?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-create-minecraft-webclient/460224</link>
    <description>Hello. I am looking to find out how to create a minecraft web client that i can use on my gaming forums. I would like it to be forced to only be able to do one thing. Select your username and then be logged into my cracked server.

I would like this to be so that people dont have to download anything in order to play my cracked server and they can play it directly on my gaming site.

I have seen something like this before on a webclient only it was the full game on the browser. Now that website has iframed in the minecraft.net client cause they had to remove it from there website.

I would like to have this again for my site. Thanks</description>
