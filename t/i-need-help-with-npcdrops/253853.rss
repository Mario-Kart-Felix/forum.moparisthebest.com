    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-npcdrops/253853</link>
    <description>well first of all i spawned some guards, and i put there npcdrops in the .cfg file like this :

npcdrop = 9   995   12   75   //guard drop/coins/12 of it/75% chance drop.
npcdrop = 9   2530   1   100   //guard drop/bones/1 of it/100% chance drop.


and yes i am tabing, but for some reason the npcs are not dropping what i put, they drop nothing at all. please help me. k0 gawd k0. and yes i got a npcdrops.java also.

and i do compile and run also. :S

i have posted this earlier but i dont understand what the person said, this is what he/she said :

you have to go into the item2.jave through item4.java,  then search the npc name, or code. The npcdrop.cfg doesnt work for all servers/sources.
Hope i could help =)

what exactly do i search for? i typed npc name and there code but i dont understand please help.

my source is fearnypks and i think was originally created by tonypker. please help.</description>

              <p>you donâ€™t put npcdrops in the cfg file<br>
you put them in npchandler under void monsterdrop or something</p>
<p>*example</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (npcs[NPCID].npcType == 509) {
ItemHandler.addItem(6104, npcs[NPCID].absX,
npcs[NPCID].absY, 1, GetNpcKiller(NPCID),
false);</code></pre>
<p>Not sure how you change the percent of chance they will get it though</p>
