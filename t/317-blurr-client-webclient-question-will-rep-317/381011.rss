    <description>Webclient Issue:
Ok, So I have been looking for a LONG time on how to make the Client.java for the server point to the correct IP, I am using the BLURR client and I would like to know how to make the connection Client Based instead of Gui based, atleast for the webclient I am making. Please help?

I tried many things that didn&#39;t work, but I probably just did them wrong, I would love for someone to help me with that, then I can make my webclient.</description>
