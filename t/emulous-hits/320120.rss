    <description>This is what i need to figure out, my updatemask for regular is 20 and i tried that to see if it would hit once and all it did was dc me. And if i do the 2nd one it is 2 hits and i have declared the 3rd the exact spots as the 2nd. So all i need is to get the figured out mask for 4 hits. Which i cant seem to do. Btw what is the &quot;|&quot; for? 

[CODE]		if (hitUpdateRequired) {
			updateMask |= 0x20;
		}

		if(hitUpdateRequired2) {
			updateMask |= 0x200;
		}
		if(hitUpdateRequired3) {
			updateMask |= 0x200;
		}[/CODE]</description>
