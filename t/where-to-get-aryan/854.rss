<p>Agreed also, but leechers are leechers, no-one can make them noleechers if they self dont want to, so best way trying to reduce leechers amount is trying to help them rather than flame(in wish that they start to learn theirself), thanks for good convo, and have good time at party <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>If you think Geno &amp; ruler deserves 200k per update go buy from them. Aryan should be free thay didnt make it and dont have the right to sell. ( in my opinion)I dont act like the world owner. I dont even act like Aryans owner. Im just an updater who spends their time updating. I DONT EVEN USE ARYAN. All i was saying is you shuld respect others. I didnt ask you to respect me nor do i care if you do.<br>
Being a leecher is nothing to be ashamed off. Like you said the majority of newbies are leechers. We have all done it. The reason you got such a flaming is because many have already asked and been awnsered and its a leechers tradition not to use the search tool. Once you have im sure done some things you will rid the status of leecher.</p>
<p>Me and geno have are diffrences. I dont hate him. I just hate the fact everything he has ever done pretty much is sold. Nearly everything he has done also has pretty much been off someone elses work.</p>
<p>Imp rimmington - Originally by regex, they just added some stuff<br>
SlaveBot - Regex and aryan devs<br>
Tutisland - pd and bruncle<br>
Essminer - danrox<br>
Chicken fighter - regex ( not sure, if they made their own)<br>
That is why Geno and Ruler annoy me.<br>
All i was trying to say was you shouldnt talk to jmr that way.</p>
<p>Whether you like it or not. You are a leecher. You have not contributed and untill you do will you not be a leecher.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes i think that they deserve, and i think also that you deserve, but its your kindness that you dont want to pull money from it.</p>
<p>Being leecher will be only a title for me, i dont think that iam a laeecher, actually at first leechers wast those who only wanted every script/release for free, for now ppl who ask questions, which can sound stupid for pr0s, are also named as leechers, whilist they are just newcomers=newbies=noobs.</p>
<p>And for coming to the respect, i think that everyone should respect each other here, maybe THEN some leechers/noobs could start to think about coding, but if ppl just stomp them away, they will never want to try.</p>

<p>Mopar is cool.</p>
<p>I also dont just update aryan mr leech, and if you didnt leech you would have read and knew that. I add my own stuff, for free.</p>
<p>Wtf did you just say without leechers there would be no community but it would be full of coders? That would be the best thing. Everyone would be learning, not asking silly questions and searching. No one would be fighting.[/quote]</p>
<p>I am respecting all people, who do their job/duty without acting like world owner…i did respect you too untill, your silly post, to make clear, if i doesnt respect someone it doesnt mean that i dont respect his actions.</p>
<p>I think that i do know Geno better than you and you cant discuss with me that if he is a thief or not, i think that they teserve that 200k for each update, while they dont shout like dogs at people who dont know anything about aryan.(i havent bought imp aryan)</p>
<p>Because of i am not leecher, i do know what you do, and i have not argued your skills while you improve aryan. And i tought that reading posts frees you from status of leecher, whilist ppl look only your postcounts and in some situations reps.(if you didint know, iam in your forums too…)</p>
<p>if you noticed i asked about aryan at first day when i regged into here.</p>
<p>And for the last thing you cant change the fact that almost 90% of runescape cheating commynity stands on leechers, who do sometimes even donate to the forum…</p>
<p>your saying that nobody would fight at ‘‘coder forums’’, how about the fight between aryanrune, imp_aryan, and rsn aryan?</p>

omo, dont get upset.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who ask for aryan, not just on these forums but if you go to any forum you’ll see. You’ll have to wait for an updated version, someone will post it when it’s ready.</p>
<p>The truth is, you are a leecher. But you know what? I am too. Infact I bet the majority of people here do leech of aryan(Meaning we havn’t contributed to it). But just take note that on forums, people generally consider any new member a noob/leecher if his spelling and grammar isn’t perfect.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Clever boy, if you read my post you can see that i have never used aryan before, and i really dont think that its leeching that i try to get some information.</p>
<p>And leechers are those guys who either dont make anything for comminity OR wont pay for any servise, and iam willing to pay, if there is need for payment.[/quote]</p>

<p>There are a lot of people who ask for aryan, not just on these forums but if you go to any forum you’ll see. You’ll have to wait for an updated version, someone will post it when it’s ready.</p>
<p>The truth is, you are a leecher. But you know what? I am too. Infact I bet the majority of people here do leech of aryan(Meaning we havn’t contributed to it). But just take note that on forums, people generally consider any new member a noob/leecher if his spelling and grammar isn’t perfect.[/quote]</p>
<p>Clever boy, if you read my post you can see that i have never used aryan before, and i really dont think that its leeching that i try to get some information.</p>
<p>And leechers are those guys who either dont make anything for comminity OR wont pay for any servise, and iam willing to pay, if there is need for payment.</p>
