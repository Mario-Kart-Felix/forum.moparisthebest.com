    <description>Are Custom Quests difficult to make?

I don&#39;t really think they would be, as it would be a simple system of objectives.

But can anyone tell me from experience?</description>

              <p>It can be various, but the main ones consist of: client.java, autospawn.cfg, and texthandler.java.</p>
<p>Client.java: Anything from the dialogue to the character quest tokens<br>
Autospawn.cfg: Where you spawn the npcs for your quest<br>
Texthandler.java: To change the text in your quest tab</p>
<p>Like the wanderer said it can be various based on the complexity of the quest.</p>

<p>I already new about RsPoser and everything, I’ve kinda watched this scene for a while. But what files have the code for quests?</p>

              <p>Matters the complexity of your quest you want to make. Also this is in wrong section? Anyways. Say you want a custom boss. You would have to set some texture skins and some vertex skins. Then make some priorities. Then you want him to attack right? So you would upload it into RsPoser and make some animations. Then say you want a custom item for killing that boss. You would have to model that and animate that. Say the weapon is held weird and there are no standard animations for it. Once again you would have to open RsPoser, import a character model with animation data, with the weapon on him for reference, and create some walk, stand, run, attack, and block emotions. It would be a great graphical process. Coding? Meh just calling interfaces and text. Unless you want it more complicated. Like I said in my very first sentence.</p>
