    <title>Flower script</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/flower-script/440484</link>
    <description>I need a script to be made for me that deals with flowers.


Basically what it needs:
Be able to say text in public/friends chats.
Identify a trade request and accept it.
Say the amount traded in the friends chat and public chat.
Click the mithril seeds and identify the color.
If it is red, orange, rainbow, or yellow it needs to repeat the above steps.
if it is blue, pastel, purple I need it to pay out x2 to the player(if black or white x3). This would probably be done by accepting the trade from the chatbox.


If you can do this, PM me. Since you are selling me a script(which I believe is the only thing allowed to be sold iirc) I will be willing to pay. It will have to be in RSGP though, but that can be sold in minutes.</description>

Iâ€™m not very good with SRL-Based scripting languages, but I consider myself fairly adept at AHK.</p>
<p>I could provide a compiled .exe version and the source as-well, in-case you want to compile it yourself.</p>
