---------------------------------------------------------
βЗЅТЅčа۩э PkZ™
---------------------------------------------------------
- This Is The Start Development Of The βЗЅТЅčа۩э PkZ™
I Have Already started making some of the changes to the start of the server like...
making it configured with SilabSoft (Thanks Miss Silabsoft) So There Will Be Many New Items.
Also Added Summoning Cape.

- Some of my friends from my home town who develop servers have already agreed to help.
You might know them (Azza P) (OwnerFraggle)

- As Of 17/2/08 members will have to pass a small test, not a very hard, or long test, to see about that, scroll
down to Requirements
Most people who want to actually help should be able to pass if they are good coders.

- this server is for beginners who want to help make a server.

- Available Tests
*HTML Test
*Server Development Test

---------------------------------------------------------
Target
---------------------------------------------------------
Our Target for the server is a basic silab server whihc has basic things
like shops, an option to train on objects and on NPCS.
If Objects not the most widely used co-ordinates (outside Varrok Bank)
Somewhere like on HiyaScape
On NPCS Their Should Be 2 Places To Choose From, Working Portals, Low Train Area
and a Pro Train Area
The Server should be able to handle many players (our target is 60 minimum)
etc.

---------------------------------------------------------
What&#39;s In It For You
---------------------------------------------------------
Your Reward Mainly is to have helped make a server, hopefully being prowd of yourself
We Could Also Give Some Different rewards out too.
And You Will Get Credit For Being Helpfull.
