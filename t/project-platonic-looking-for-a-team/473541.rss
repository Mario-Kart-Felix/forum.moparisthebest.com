    <title>Project Platonic (Looking for a Team)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-platonic-looking-for-a-team/473541</link>
    <description>Hello! I&#39;m looking to start my own RSPS. 

First off, I am looking for a group/team of people to help me on this project.

Second, I will be paying for the website, vps, hosting, etc... When it&#39;s released.

My Skype - ProjectPlatonic


Application Format:

Your name - 
Your Age - 
How long have you played RSPS&#39;s - 
Any experience in server coding/client coding/websites - 
How much time are you willing to put into this project a week - 
Favorite part of RSPS&#39;s (Do you enjoy skilling, PvP, helping others?) - 


Sorry for such a short post, but currently I&#39;m about to take a nap. I&#39;ll check back on this after I wake up and get back with everyone who has applied and or comments.</description>
