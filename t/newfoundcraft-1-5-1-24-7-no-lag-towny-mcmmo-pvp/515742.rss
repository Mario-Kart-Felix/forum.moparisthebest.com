    <description>NewFoundCraft is a new server if is fun with a new spawn 
The spawn is completely done but everything else is 
We have a full kind staff that answer questions and help out 
They also host random events like spleef parlour zombies ctf 
And more 
The server has many useful plugins
We have a small economy but hey everything has to start somewhere.
Small or big the server is a wonderful server you get to interact with players 
Mine and make a town then join a nation.
We also have many ranks and we have donor ranks !
The ip to the server is newfoundcraft.mcph.co:25641 
There might not be anyone on sometimes but hey as I said the server has to start somewhere and I am usually on everyday right now I am hiving the first 5 people that join the server elite rank which is cool access to fly and god and aloud to change there nicknames
The server also has a mumble and teams peak 3 along with a website 
Server ip:newfoundcraft.mcph.co:25641
Website address: http://playnewfoundcraft.enjin.com

Well I really hope if you join you have a marvellous time on my server 
And if you feel like something should be added go on the website to the forums and 
Tell us what you think under &quot;what the server needs&quot;

Thank you for taking your time to read
