    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portal-question/58240</link>
    <description>Basically I want to make a special area, but I need some portals, I got the tutorial from here...So firstly check it out: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,69501.0.html&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now if I want to put more portals in which case would you put it in? Tried putting in same case and stuff, but a bit confused, can anybody explain what some of the numbers mean and how to put it? :P

Ok never mind I figured it out, it has to be a case, and can&#39;t be over 3000, but can be random pretty much tested it :D thx guys! :mad: lmao :P</description>
