    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/deltabased-317-help-with-making-players-unable-to-follow/364937</link>
    <description>ok, first off i need help with the ::jail command...atm it works 100% and you can also ::unjail someone...but when the person is in jail if another player is nearby the prisoner can escape by pressing follow...ik this has something to do with clipping, but all i want to know is how to make it so that person can not move...it is a 1X1 jail cell but still they can move around by following...so id like to know how to make them not be able to do that, then they r in jail until i say they arnt anymore :D 

[s]Secondly, i have owner, admin, and mod capes, not a donator cape yet. but yeah, anybody can put these on, i was thinking maybe to have a password that the person has to know, even though a normal player will probably never get an owner or mod or admin cape i think there should still be a password, or a function like a fire cape that says you have to be owner to wear this item ect.[/s] resolved

that is all, whoever helps me will get creds in my next update thanks!</description>

<p>I don’t know if this will be much help, but for the owner cape and admin etc… make a staff zone, and make it that someone in there can sell it to you, so only staff members would be able to get the cape.</p>

</aside>
<p>I dis-agree. What if a player finds their way into the “Staff Zone” But I know another suggestion to stop players buying the items.</p>
<p>Make it so it costs like points, like “Staff Points” or something. You need 25 to buy the cape.<br>
Also make it so you have to be a Staff Member to wield it.</p>

              <p>I don’t know if this will be much help, but for the owner cape and admin etc… make a staff zone, and make it that someone in there can sell it to you, so only staff members would be able to get the cape.</p>

              <p>ok, first off i need help with the ::jail command…atm it works 100% and you can also ::unjail someone…but when the person is in jail if another player is nearby the prisoner can escape by pressing follow…ik this has something to do with clipping, but all i want to know is how to make it so that person can not move…it is a 1X1 jail cell but still they can move around by following…so id like to know how to make them not be able to do that, then they r in jail until i say they arnt anymore <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-s">Secondly, i have owner, admin, and mod capes, not a donator cape yet. but yeah, anybody can put these on, i was thinking maybe to have a password that the person has to know, even though a normal player will probably never get an owner or mod or admin cape i think there should still be a password, or a function like a fire cape that says you have to be owner to wear this item ect.</span> resolved</p>
<p>that is all, whoever helps me will get creds in my next update thanks!</p>
