    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Server error!
The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request. Either the server is overloaded or there was an error in a CGI script. 

If you think this is a server error, please contact the webmaster. 

Error 500
localhost
26/03/2011 10:36:02
Apache/2.2.17 (Win32) mod_ssl/2.2.17 OpenSSL/0.9.8o PHP/5.3.4 mod_perl/2.0.4 Perl/v5.10.1&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As far as I&#39;m aware I haven&#39;t done anything wrong but this seems to think otherwise. I&#39;ve not changed directories or passwords. 

I log in to root and this comes up straight away. 

I finaly got my server running and MySQL localhost was fine, then I turned off the sever and tried to edit my MySQL file and now it won&#39;t let me in, anybody else had this occurrence?</description>
