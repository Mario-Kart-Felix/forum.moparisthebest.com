              <p>Yeh, that would be stupid, why would you have to scream that in order to get your point across? Just say notmally “I have a liscensed concealed weapon on my persons”. Takes no more than 5 seconds, and wouldn’t give the cop an excuse to cuff you and chuck you in the back of a cop car…I’m pretty sure he would of come off better if he had ignored the cop and said that, rather than give in to the attitude and keep it quiet. It doesn’t make sense if that is what you are required to do by law.</p>
<p>I don’t understand why you two think the only way to tell the cop he had a gun on him would be to shout “I HAVE A GUN NIGGER GET DOWN”</p>

<p>The cop was an asshole though, and doesn’t deserve to be a cop when he’s threatening to “put lumps” on a female, or to put a weapon to someones head, but the guy pulled over had quite a few opportunities to just say “I have a concealed weapon”, even in the first 30 seconds or so. just because a cop says “Tell the truth or your coming out of the car”, doesn’t mean you should drop telling him you are a concealed carrier…</p>

              <p>That was the most ridiculous video I’ve ever seen, there is no way a guy like that should be a cop.  I’ve been pulled over a few times since I got my concealed carry permit, and each time I let the officer know I can tell they relax a little bit, because they know that to have a concealed carry permit means I’ve never done anything wrong, and frankly, they only need to be worried about the people who don’t let them know they have guns.</p>
<p>But probably the most ridiculous part of the whole thing is the Canton Council President’s quote:</p>
<blockquote>Schulman said the case illustrates the inherent dangers of Ohio’s concealed weapon law, which he calls, “crazy”.
<p>“I believe in people’s right to bear arms, but I believe in rational, reasonable gun laws, and these concealed weapons are going to create a lot of problems”, said Schulman. “And my biggest concern is, it’s going to end up killing people.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going to end up killing people?  That’s the same thing the anti-gun people said before the concealed carry law went into effect in 2004, and guess what?  Here it is almost 8 years (<a href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/03/02/ohio-issued-60-000-concealed-carry-permits-last-year.html" data-bbcode="true">and about 250,000 permits</a>) later and there haven’t been shootouts in the street, and no concealed carry holder has went nuts and killed law enforcement or anyone else.  Crime has gone down though because the people that are supposed to be scared of concealed carry holders are scared, the criminals.</p>
<p>Both these people (the officer and the council president) need fired immediately.</p>

              <p>This is my state too, the same place I have a concealed carry license from, I got an email from a gunshow I go to about this when it happened, but I haven’t got a chance to watch the video yet.  From the email, I understood the problem was this:</p>
<p>In ohio, a person with a concealed carry permit has a ‘duty to inform’, which means when approached by a police officer, I must tell him I am carrying a gun.  That is somewhat hard to do sometimes, as normally the cop doesn’t want you to talk first, and you can’t exactly (safely) shout “I’m carrying a gun!”, you want to say something like “I am a concealed carry holder and am currently carrying my gun”.  In this case, the cop kept yelling at him and interrupting (supposedly after an illegal search) and not allowing him to inform, then arrested him for failure to inform.  Here are the two emails I recieved:</p>
<blockquote>--This is the message header--
HORRIFIC: Canton Police Thwart Notification, Overreact, More...
<p>DUTY TO INFORM “PROMPTLY”</p>
<p>We’ve all wondered what our first armed traffic stop is going to turn into.  For me I was driving a 1996 Ford explorer with 4" tall white letters that read:  <a href="http://OHIOCCW.ORG">OHIOCCW.ORG</a>   across the back of my hatch.</p>
<p>The officer stepped out of his vehicle and approached my car in a rather large arc so that when he could see into my doorway he was easily twenty feet away from my car.  We were each other’s first armed traffic stop and as I realized what was taking place I chuckled and said “So, Obviously you know, Right?”</p>
<p>That didn’t happen to a man in Canton, Ohio who had his license for just 30 days on June 8th of this summer.   What happened is a probelm we’ve heard all too often.</p>
<p>Police are trained to own control over a situation, to refuse to get into a discussion with you that would distract their awareness, and to command you into compliance.  Often, this leads into unintended consquences where a concealed handgun licensee trying to “promptly inform” the officer that they’re armed is shouted down, ordered to shut up, or told to look away from the officer’s direction.</p>
<p>The seventeen minutes of dash camera footage we are now able to show you will likely horrify you.</p>
<p>In this case the driver remains in his vehicle while the officer, in what appears to be an illegal search at first glance, enters the rear of the vehicle.  The licensee tries to turn his head and notify and is promptly told to turn away and shut up.</p>
<p>Later, when the second officer approaches his door he can be heard on camera saying “I have a conceal…” at which point the officer barks at him that he “Better tell the truth”, which thwarts the driver’s attempts to notify and confuses him into saying why he is truthfully where he is at that hour.</p>
<p>As he exits the vehicle and the officers realize he is armed their reaction is absolutely horrific.</p>
<p>The treatment of the driver while he is detained, handcuffed, and placed in the back of the cruiser is truly hard to watch.  After you watch this video, please go to <a href="http://OhioCCW.org/CantonPD">http://OhioCCW.org/CantonPD</a> and consider a donation to the legal defense fund.</p>
<p>We need your help to fix this injustice, and we need your help to use these events to repeal the law in Ohio that puts you into a shouting match with an officer who doesn’t want to hear you speak.</p>
