    <title>718 Character Save Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-character-save-issue/521896</link>
    <description>This is my first time starting a rsps.. i am mainly using it for just me and my friends so i am using Citellum&#39;s 718 base.

The issue is with the Character Saves. It saves the files into a .P format instead of .Txt so i can&#39;t edit any players that way. I have spent a few hours looking for a fix and trying things myself with no luck, so if someone could please help me i would appreciate it.

Just pointing out i am completely new to this and i am willing to learn as much as i can. so any help related to this or anything else would be appreciated.</description>

              <p>it would be best to leave them as .p files unless you want to rewrite out the whole data again, to set player rights user player.java and use commands to help edit character etc. it would be easier <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
