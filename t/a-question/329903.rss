if(i == #####) // Your desired item id (the one you use after ::pickup ##### #)
{
class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;; // String name, this can be changed to wield, or attach, or whatever you want
class8.anInt174 = #####; // Drop/Inv Model
class8.anInt165 = #####; // Male Wield Model
class8.anInt200 = #####; // Female Wield
class8.anInt188 = #####; // Male arms/sleeves (Leave as -1 if not used)
class8.anInt164 = #####; // Female arms/sleeves (Leave as -1 if not used)
        class8.anInt181 = 800; // Zoom - Increase to make inv model smaller
        class8.anInt190 = 498; // Rotate up/down -  Increase to rotate upwards
        class8.anInt198 = 1300; // Rotate right/left - Increase to rotate right
        class8.anInt169 = -1; // Position in inv, increase to move right
        class8.anInt194 = -1; // Position in inv, increase to move up                                               
class8.aString170 = &quot;@@@@@@@@@@@&quot;; // Item Name
class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;@@@@@@@@@@&quot;.getBytes(); // Item Examine
      }

at the @@@@@@@@ letters are needed. At the ############### numbers are needed.
Now at the first ###########, i entered 8001, the number of my barrelchest anchor. Thats what i try to add.
Now at the other ####### i just added random code. Can anyone help me with what i REAL need to enter there?
And another question. I had added the random numbers. Then i tried: ::pickup 08001 1. I get nothing in inventory? What did i do wrong? Ir did i need to do this too: Now.
If you can&#39;t be bothered to open up metasequoia and recolour a runescape model, then it is possible to do it through the ints.
Note: This is only possible with runescape models, e.g, if you wanted to recolour a steel defender to a rune defender.

This is fairly simple, you need to add these strings into your ints for the item you would like to recolour.

Or is that just if u want to do?</description>

              <p>Considering that is has a ‘//’ with what goes there after each line, you still decided to enter random numbers? You should add the model ID that the code after the '//'s say to add…</p>

              <p>[quote=“SirPali, post:2, topic:329903”]Ok first, your question is really messy. I had to reread it 3 times just to get what you are trying to ask.</p>
<p>Anyway.<br>
Since when is it a good idea just to enter a random number when you have no clue what to add?</p>
<p>A model consists of 2 files, one for the inventory / ground model, and one for the wearing model.<br>
Check the names of your model files for the barrelchest. The first one is (atleast, thats what I understand from your question) 8001. Thats means the wearing model is 8002.</p>
<p>Now for your 2nd question, I have no clue what you are trying to ask, so please rephrase it.[/quote]</p>
<p>He is asking, what model id goes where. Well, the first #### is the item id you want to make…so like on your server, you make it like ::pickup #### (like that).</p>
<p>The next #### is how the item looks when it is in your inv. You need to know the model id for that, so if you have the models, find out which one is the drop/inv one. (try opening it up with a datmaker, rsmv, or metasaquia or w.e its called. If it is on the floor, it is that one.</p>
<p>Next, the male wearing model id, you must find that model, and the female one is usually one after it, so if the male id is 100, the females is 101. Get it?</p>
<p>The sleeves, you don’t need. You are not wearing anything on your torso, or arms. If you end up adding the correct standing animation, then you MIGHT end up needing to change that. Otherwise, all you need to do is find out which model id, goes where. really simple to do.</p>
