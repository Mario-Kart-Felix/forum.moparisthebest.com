    <title>A Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-question/64593</link>
    <description>ok so i was wondering if there was an easy way to make a whole bunch of objects get replaced by something else. For example, im making the farming skill almost identical to the way runescape has it. i have my farming timer set up and everything. 

lets say i plant some cabbage seed in an allotment, it deletes the cabbage seeds from my inventory, and adds the cabbages to the allotment. then the timer starts. after let&#39;s say, 15 minutes, the cabbages are ready to be collected. so i use a shovel with the allotment and get X number of cabbages. the only problem im getting is makeing it so that once i plant something in one patch, and plant another thing in another patch, it will replace both of those with the finished result. any ideas how?

this is the kinda of code i have in mind:

[code]if(itemUsed == 5318 &amp;&amp; useWith == 8573)
{
PlayerHandler.veggieTimerRunning = true;
if(veggieTimer = 120)
{
replaceObject(8535, 8537);
}
if(veggieTimer = 240)
{
replaceObject(8537, 8539);
}[/code][br][size=1]Posted on: March 04, 2007, 06:56:49 PM[/size][hr]can anyone help me with this?</description>
