    <title>Why do private servers fail?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-do-private-servers-fail/533998</link>
    <description>Do not use money as a benefactor. Lets assume that the/an owner has enough money to cover server and website fees, etc. I understand that this is one of the major reasons they do fail, and it isn&#39;t what I want to discuss.

With that being noted, I see new servers pop up everyday, some are alright, some aren&#39;t. But there is always that rare gem that just seems to be better than the rest, and the community on it is rather good. However, after a few weeks the players stop logging in, and eventually the server gets deserted and that leads to it being shut down. What I want to know is why? I want to know because it&#39;s good to have this information on the side so I don&#39;t make the mistakes if I do ever happen to go public with my server.

Some reasons I&#39;ve been thinking about are:
Content - There just isn&#39;t enough, and players get bored.
Leveling - When you level in the game, it needs to feel like an accomplishment. Not hitting a rock crab once and getting 99.
Economy - Starting a server&#39;s economy is hard. You don&#39;t want to hand out items and make new players intimidated by the current ones. But at the same time you want to get everything rolling.
Players - This is what I believe to be one of the biggest key factors in your servers life. It doesn&#39;t matter if you have 5 players or 500, if they are all cunts and rude, no one will want to join.
Advertising - While this takes money (in some ways), it&#39;s another key factor. If your name isn&#39;t out there, how will players know to join?</description>

              <p>Economy, 2 or maby 3 years ago Server called “near-reality” had perfect economy<br>
until they ruin it with 600+ shit, but the point is what they created simple but<br>
really efectivy economy, many ppl knows what near reality was pk server<br>
but still evrything was connected, like: you kill goblin you get noted stuffs you sell it to shop for 10k<br>
other players whos train a herblore buying it back from shop and creating pots, selling it to shop, buying suplies agen and so on,<br>
slayer ofcorse here was hard, you had to train it like week to get 85, but it made stuffs like whip rare, and cuz of fact what it is pk server, it was worth it, like the herblore or any other skill.</p>

Yeah, I was talking about the Ex-Players (like myself). I still have an account on Runescape and 07Scape (no members), I just don’t log in because they are both on opposite ends of the poles (by which I mean, what I like.). I loved the era around 2009-2012 (pre EoC) and I wish I could recreate it to the fullest extent, but I just don’t see myself doing that.</p>

I’ve seen that so many times, and honestly I have to agree. Sure, getting rare’s and such on a server should be <span class="bbcode-i">easier</span> but not so easy a person can camp at Nex or any boss, and just get an entire rare armor set within a day.</p>

              <p>The only “good” that can be brought into the server to promote success are factors that can be controlled, such as the items and prices that are offered in the economy. Unfortunately, the only way you can have a successful and controlled economy is if you can find players that are willing to do so, and this would eliminate competition altogether, which is a huge asset in player interaction. I wish I could give you the perfect answer that would just lead a private server to instant success, but even the biggest and most reputable servers can only appeal to a certain group of people. If you really want to make a private server successful, you will have to change the people, not the server.</p>

              <p>4 players on each world on runescape could easily get the best drop in a day.

Most servers don’t even have 100 dragons spawned throughout the game, so there’d be doubles/triples on each one. Making it even harder. Plus the average server gets, at most, 10 players online at a time.</p>
<p>And plus, you said “One way you could go about it is have the exp rate go up the more players are online, and cap it at a sensible rate.” Meaning idle players would make it easier for the ones that are actually doing shit.</p>
<p>Lastly. The 100 players killing dragons could have been at it all week before all 100 of them get a visage, same if it were for the 4.[/quote]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">//concept code
for (Player p: world.getWorld().getPlayers()) {
        if (p.isActive()) {
                int players = world.getWorld().getPlayers().size();
                EXP_RATE = players &gt; 249 ? 250 : players;

<p>You can always make it work to meet your specific needs. It’s all about potential. Not even 100 dragons spawned? So spawn more dragons.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">All</span> wilderness locations, Taverly dungeon, metal dragon locations, Crandor, KBD, underground pass etc. (even one or two custom areas) would surpass 100 dragons.</p>
<p>Fine, 70 dragons, either way, better than 4 players online as opposed to 400 players fighting 70 dragons.</p>
<p>The more players there are to kill dragons, the higher the chance one of those players will get a decent drop, so change the variable to make it harder. What’s not to understand, it’s black and white.</p>
<p>RuneScape has over 140 worlds. As soon as Nex was released, someone got the best drop in that same day. If there was only 4 players on 1 world, it would of taken weeks.</p>
<p>It’s all about the player count and adapting your variables to accommodate that. That’s why server’s fail in my opinion, because they don’t accommodate the player specifically, or players overall.</p>
