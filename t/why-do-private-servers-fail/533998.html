        <p>Do not use money as a benefactor. Lets assume that the/an owner has enough money to cover server and website fees, etc. I understand that this is one of the major reasons they do fail, and it isn’t what I want to discuss.</p>
<p>With that being noted, I see new servers pop up everyday, some are alright, some aren’t. But there is always that rare gem that just seems to be better than the rest, and the community on it is rather good. However, after a few weeks the players stop logging in, and eventually the server gets deserted and that leads to it being shut down. What I want to know is why? I want to know because it’s good to have this information on the side so I don’t make the mistakes if I do ever happen to go public with my server.</p>
<p>Some reasons I’ve been thinking about are:<br>
Content - There just isn’t enough, and players get bored.<br>
Leveling - When you level in the game, it needs to feel like an accomplishment. Not hitting a rock crab once and getting 99.<br>
Economy - Starting a server’s economy is hard. You don’t want to hand out items and make new players intimidated by the current ones. But at the same time you want to get everything rolling.<br>
Players - This is what I believe to be one of the biggest key factors in your servers life. It doesn’t matter if you have 5 players or 500, if they are all cunts and rude, no one will want to join.<br>
Advertising - While this takes money (in some ways), it’s another key factor. If your name isn’t out there, how will players know to join?</p>

Economy is key sadly.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Then talk more about it, what’s a good way to start an economy?<br>
I want a discussion here. Not just simple answers.[/quote]Sadly I don’t have my long ass sermon on economy on my hd any longer lol… there was a copy on Paladious but the site is down now and I don’t know if Ambokile/Flame_ still has the pastebin.

        <p>Economies and exp rates need to be faster than RuneScape, but on the flipside not too fast. There is no perfect economy solution or exp rate because every player has different views on what a good economy or exp rate is (I believe exp rate is a valuable asset to how your economy will turn out).</p>
<p>One way you could go about it is have the exp rate go up the more players are online, and cap it at a sensible rate. That is what I have done.</p>
<p>The same can go for NPC drop rates, rare clue scroll item rates etc. The more players online, the more potential players are doing one single activity so the more potential there is for rarer items to enter the economy faster. Just make everything a little rarer the more players are online, and reward them with a slightly better exp rate.</p>
<p>About as balanced as you can get it I think.</p>

        <p>I’ll just expand on what you have already mentioned:</p>
<p>Content: I don’t think players get bored because of the lack of content, because a lot of servers have many of the core features offered in the revision of that server, although many things such as quests and other achievements get ignored, which is most likely due to the fact that most people would be too bothered to pay attention to those things.</p>
<p>Leveling: The biggest problem is definitely the fact that sometimes leveling is <span class="bbcode-i">too</span> easy. Once again, a lot of people would be too bothered to put a lot of time into something that has generally been easy.</p>
<p>Economy: The economy is obviously a huge problem, and usually tends to have many faults, but even professional games such as RuneScape have some faults with the economy, but these are caused by the people. In private servers, you not only have to take the people into account, but the staff members, which are usually notorious for handing out items, which is also why orders should be put into place in order to prevent staff members with spawning rights from transferring items to normal players.</p>
<p>Advertising - No matter what you are in doing in a socially active experience, it will not always be easy to get a name out there, so you should expect the same for private servers. There are tons of private servers out there with great foundations, but unfortunately they lack a player base that enjoys that foundation.</p>
<p>Players - I saved this for last because this is the fundamental issue at hand with almost every single factor that is taken into building a private server. The people are what makes the whole thing go 'round, and this is due to the fact that they not only inspire, but help you run the server in a hidden, yet structured way. The economy is pretty much ran by the people. Things like content and leveling appeal to certain people, and there is just a huge lack in the number of people that are willing to be a part of a structured community.</p>

One way you could go about it is have the exp rate go up the more players are online, and cap it at a sensible rate.</p>
<p>The same can go for NPC drop rates, rare clue scroll item rates etc. The more players online, the more potential players are doing one single activity so the more potential there is for rarer items to enter the economy faster. Just make everything a little rarer the more players are online, and reward them with a slightly better exp rate.</p>
<p>About as balanced as you can get it I think.<br>

That would be stupid imo. Because you could have players idle (Though my server has a 10 minute timer) and the rewards go up for players not doing anything. Also, EXP should be static, the only time it should change is if you switch materials (or in combat, get a better hit). EXP should never vary because there is no reason for it to. I understand if you use a multiplier like c.playerLevel[12] * Config.ExpBonus. But nothing more.<br>
Also, making items rare based on players online? Really. Sure, it can cap. But why would you even do that?</p>

<p>How would idle players be getting a reward if they are idle for exp rate and npc drops?</p>
<p>It’s a good idea IMO, because nothing else seems to be working thus far. If there are 4 players online, there are less players killing dragons, so you would want visages to drop more common than if there were 400 players online.</p>
<p>The economy is dynamic to the player’s online. It works for everybody.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
[i]Takes one week with 4 players online to get a visage drop from a dragon. Who would want to play a server that hard? You’d make it easier considering only 4 people can kill dragons, and potentially some of those players would be doing different things anyway.</p>
<p>400 players online. Make it extremely difficult to get a visage because, say, 100 players are all killing dragons at the same time, there’s more chance that 1 person will get a visage at a low drop rate, than there is 4 people getting one at a higher drop rate.</p>
