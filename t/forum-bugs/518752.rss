    <description>At the bottom it shows this 

[img]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/Themes/core/images/new_some.gif[/img]

when that isn&#39;t the correct button(for the mopar theme?)

[hr]

Not sure if it happens to everyone but sometimes when I click on a board to go to that board index cause it said there was a new topic. It doesn&#39;t show there being a new topic(with the blue square thingy on the topic title or whatever)

I am using Google Chrome

[hr]

If you go to forum stats at the bottom it shows several people who are in the lead as topic starters yet they have 0 posts for whatever reason. That should be changed as they are obviously not in the lead any longer?

[hr]

 If you go to your profile, go to group memberships there is one that says 

&lt;blockquote&gt;View Archived Boards
Allows you to view (read-only) the otherwise hidden, old boards that are no longer relevant&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I am a member of this group yet as far as I know I don&#39;t see any? (Or at least it doesn&#39;t tell me this is a hidden board...)</description>
