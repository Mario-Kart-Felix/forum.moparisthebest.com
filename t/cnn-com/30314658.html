<p>There are more guns in Canada than the US, and more pot coming from Canada to the US than the other way around. I don’t understand your point, that Canada is as bad as Mexico?</p>

my cousin has a frikkin uzi stuffed in his house  because vancouvers so dam dangerous and there house got robbed once<br>

<p>Ok?</p>
<p>[quote]<br>
and healthcare for the rich is going back to medieval times [/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t think you understand healthcare. The more money you have, the better care you recieve. It just makes sense. In Canada, they have made things alot more equal, which means the quality of everyones healthcare goes down. It’s better in some ways and worse in others.[/quote]</p>
<p>alright letws go in frikkin order :</p>
<p>1)so youve travelled the whole world? not just i went to vacation to mexico oooooooooo</p>
<p>2)yah that one tribe your talking about is my tribe the kurdish<br>
my dad was also a freedom fighter so was my uncle they were both wanted dead<br>
they knew how to fight and fire rocket launchers as kids</p>
<p>3)are u joking me about the guns even if there are there not automatic most of the guns are used for hunting unlike your  NRA who thinks you need a frikkin assault rifle to shoot a deer we use single shot rifles (wait is it nra or what?) anyways im pretty sure we dont have more guns then you</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>indubidibly</li>
</ol>
<p>5)i do understand the concept of privitization of health care you pay cash or you die or if your dieing they fix you and say 100,000 dollars please id rather have some healthcare then have none at all</p>
<p>btw each number is for each quote u stated</p>

<li>No, but I’ve been to enough other countries and read enough history to understand that America is the best nation there is right now.</li>
</ol>
<p>2)Ok, thanks for not adressing my point at all.</p>
<p>3)There are many more guns in Canada though the violent crime rate is lower. My point is simply that the Mexican border with the US is alot worse for the US than the US border with Canada is. How many people are running to escape America into Canada? Only a few army deserters, which  tells you something right there.</p>
<p>5)Obviously, you don’t understand. Healthcare in the US is very, very, good and is of a very high quality. If you can’t afford it, who cares? Move to Canada.</p>

</aside>
<p>The US went to Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction and stayed there to free the Iraqi people and plant the seeds of democracy, according to the US gov’t. I don’t believe that, and you don’t either. However, America is the best country in the world, the country with the most freedom in the world. Even if the war is stupid, that’s no reason to call Americans dirty filthy whores. American lives are worth more to Americans than Iraqi lives, and Iraqi lives are worth nothing even to Iraqis. The people of the middle east are in a state of constant warfare and religious conflict, as they have been for the past few thousand years.</p>
<p>[quote]btw if they did kill those iraqis with no reason except revenge cuz there friend got bombed they desere to die<br>
and[/quote]</p>
<p>You do realize that the most common tactic of the terrorist is suicide bombing civilians? The only reason this is a news story at all is because it’s so rare for Americans to do something like this. If  we want to slaughter civilians we usually go the shock and awe route, see Dresden or Hiroshima.[/quote]</p>

<p>That’s why I said they can <span class="bbcode-b">move</span> to Canada if they don’t like it here. Social darwinism is part of the US culture, get over it.</p>
<blockquote>army deserters meh i got nothin to say to them the army wont let em quit so they leave they have a right to leave when they want</blockquote>
<p>When you join the army, you agree not to just “Quit” whenever you want. In fact, you sign something. Deserters are the worst people on earth.</p>

<p>This is a discussion and a debate, not an argument.</p>

It seems pretty clear that the Iraqis don't give a fuck about eachother. How many suicide bombings occur in the US?

        <p>No country will have <span class="bbcode-b">complete</span> freedom. However, the US is the closest thing there is to a free country. In the US people have more rights than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<blockquote>There are countries who have as much freedom as USA, or even more, for example Sweden, or Norway, etc.
<p>What you saying is bullshit and it’s all crap…“USA owns, US is blahblah…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s my opinion that the US is the best country in the world. However, it is a fact that the laws and traditions of the US make it the most free country in the world. Yes, Norway and Sweden have laws that make them free countries comparable to the US, however we in America have the Constitution fo the United States of America, which is the most powerful and important document that has ever existed. It guarantees our right not only to freedom of speech, press, and religion, but also our right to violently overthrow our government if we don’t like what’s going on.</p>
<blockquote>"Also, the people who do suicide bombings, they kill the Iraqs becaus they co-operate with the american soldiers etc."</blockquote>
<p>Suicide bombers kill people because they are insane, and believe they will recieve 42 virgins upon blowing themselves up. The suicide bombers target anyone who isn’t a radical muslim, basically. Jews, Americans, Iraqi soldiers and police, are their favorite targets, but they don’t give a fuck who they kill as long as it isn’t a radical muslim.</p>
<blockquote>That was another suggestion/idea, also, I told you something else and you didn't comment that 
because you got owned okthx go home and learn some history.</blockquote>
<p>Some things you say make so little sense that I don’t understand them. Sorry.</p>
<blockquote>Don't come here and talk shit except you know anything from Asia, go back to your little USA and tell how great is. You're living cool, you ain't at war, you ain't seeing all the trouble, your sitting comfortable in your chair and making 500 stupid topics.</blockquote>
<p>My country (the US) is at war. I haven’t made 500 topics, I haven’t even broken 100 at that.</p>
<p>I think you should read “All Quiet on the Western Front”, “Slaughterhouse Five”, and/or “A Rumour of War”, any or all of which will give you some idea of what war and freedom are really about.</p>

        <p>[quote=“PaulT, post:33, topic:3031”]No country will have <span class="bbcode-b">complete</span> freedom. However, the US is the closest thing there is to a free country. In the US people have more rights than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>[quote]There are countries who have as much freedom as USA, or even more, for example Sweden, or Norway, etc.</p>
<p>What you saying is bullshit and it’s all crap…“USA owns, US is blahblah…”[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s my opinion that the US is the best country in the world. However, it is a fact that the laws and traditions of the US make it the most free country in the world. Yes, Norway and Sweden have laws that make them free countries comparable to the US, however we in America have the Constitution fo the United States of America, which is the most powerful and important document that has ever existed. It guarantees our right not only to freedom of speech, press, and religion, but also our right to violently overthrow our government if we don’t like what’s going on.</p>

“Also, the people who do suicide bombings, they kill the Iraqs becaus they co-operate with the american soldiers etc.”[/quote]</p>
<p>Suicide bombers kill people because they are insane, and believe they will recieve 42 virgins upon blowing themselves up. The suicide bombers target anyone who isn’t a radical muslim, basically. Jews, Americans, Iraqi soldiers and police, are their favorite targets, but they don’t give a fuck who they kill as long as it isn’t a radical muslim.</p>
<p>[quote]<br>
That was another suggestion/idea, also, I told you something else and you didn’t comment that<br>
because you got owned okthx go home and learn some history.[/quote]</p>
<p>Some things you say make so little sense that I don’t understand them. Sorry.</p>
<p>[quote]<br>
Don’t come here and talk shit except you know anything from Asia, go back to your little USA and tell how great is. You’re living cool, you ain’t at war, you ain’t seeing all the trouble, your sitting comfortable in your chair and making 500 stupid topics.[/quote]</p>
<p>My country (the US) is at war. I haven’t made 500 topics, I haven’t even broken 100 at that.</p>
<p>I think you should read “All Quiet on the Western Front”, “Slaughterhouse Five”, and/or “A Rumour of War”, any or all of which will give you some idea of what war and freedom are really about.[/quote]</p>
<p>“However, the US is the closest thing there is to a free country”<br>
Still, that’s your OPIONON, so write that its your opionon and don’t write that. If it’s the closest thing there is to a free country. I hardly doubt that. Hardly. You say this because you live at USA; because you are probably born there etc, if you were from Iraq you would say Iraq is the best. So shush and don’t spread USA propoganda in this forum k? You just make people hate it even more.</p>
<p>How do you know suicide bombers kill people because their insane? You don’t know. All you do is writing a bunch of crap.</p>
<p>“The suicide bombers target anyone who isn’t a radical muslim, basically. Jews, Americans, Iraqi soldiers and police, are their favorite targets, but they don’t give a fuck who they kill as long as it isn’t a radical muslim.” Where you got that from? But sure, it can be tha too.</p>
<p>After all the bomb attents and such, I say one of the reason is they kill the people who co operate with the US soldiers etc. Bush wants to spread peace, he should start with his own country first. He kills his own people and blame it on so called “terrorists” which I hardly believe they are so powerful to blow WTC, when they say USA got such a high security with all the new technology. He attacks every country he wants, at first, they put people like Saddam in power and then they get rid of him, they talked about mass-thingy-weapons, none found. If you see TV, not USA TV’s. You see how the Iraqs/Afghans are mad that US and the others are in their OWN country and ruleing it. If the people want rid of someone, let them do a revolution. They say Saddam killed alot of people, proof? Saddam and USA have played many games and co-operated together alot, for example in the war against Iran, Iraq got lots of weapons from other countries… and the same to Iran.</p>
<p>“I think you should read “All Quiet on the Western Front”, “Slaughterhouse Five”, and/or “A Rumour of War”, any or all of which will give you some idea of what war and freedom are really about.”</p>
<p>I prefer not reading USA propoganda books or w/e.</p>

        <blockquote>"However, the US is the closest thing there is to a free country"
Still, that's your OPIONON, so write that its your opionon and don't write that. If it's the closest thing there is to a free country. I hardly doubt that. Hardly. You say this because you live at USA; because you are probably born there etc, if you were from Iraq you would say Iraq is the best. So shush and don't spread USA propoganda in this forum k? You just make people hate it even more.</blockquote>
<p>No that’s a fact. And I would not say Iraq was the best country even if I was from Iraq. Think about it; how strong is nationalism in Iraq? It’s nonexistent. You can see that by the daily death toll of Iraqi police and soldiers.</p>
<p>I have stated the reasons the US is the best country in the world and you have chosen to ignore them and say it is because I grew up here. I of all people know how many problems the US has, and I am well aware that many other countries compete with the US in different areas. However, you are ignoring the content of my posts and repeating your same conviction that I am simply a stupid American.</p>
<blockquote>How do you know suicide bombers kill people because their insane? You don't know. All you do is writing a bunch of crap.</blockquote>
<p>I know suicide bombers are insane because they are suicide bombers.</p>
<blockquote>After all the bomb attents and such, I say one of the reason is they kill the people who co operate with the US soldiers etc. Bush wants to spread peace, he should start with his own country first. He kills his own people and blame it on so called "terrorists" which I hardly believe they are so powerful to blow WTC, when they say USA got such a high security with all the new technology.</blockquote>
<p>Yes, they do kill US collaborators, but they also kill, as I have said, everyone but radical muslims. I share your skepticism of the official story of what happened on 9/11, but I’m not prepared to make stupid blanket statements.</p>
<blockquote>He attacks every country he wants, at first,</blockquote>
<p>With approval of the other branches of the US government.</p>
<blockquote>they put people like Saddam in power and then they get rid of him, they talked about mass-thingy-weapons, none found. If you see TV, not USA TV's. You see how the Iraqs/Afghans are mad that US and the others are in their OWN country and ruleing it.</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it’s a fucked up situation, and the US has a history of these kind of failed operations. I’m aware the Iraqi’s and the Afghani’s don’t want us their. I don’t think we should be their either. I think we should leave them to kill eachother, as they have been doing for thousands of years. I repeat, learn the history of the middle east, and it will become clear to you the US is just another tribe.</p>
<blockquote>If the people want rid of someone, let them do a revolution.</blockquote>
<p>To have a revolution, you need a strong middle class. Example: South Korea, or China. Once you have an established middle class they will revolt and create a democratic government. However, this will probably never happen in the middle east, where the people with the most weapons are the people in charge. This just happens to be the US tribe at this point.</p>
<blockquote>They say Saddam killed alot of people, proof? Saddam and USA have played many games and co-operated together alot, for example in the war against Iran, Iraq got lots of weapons from other countries.. and the same to Iran.</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so? I agree with you 100% the war in Iraq is pointless and based upon lies.</p>
<blockquote>I prefer not reading USA propoganda books or w/e.</blockquote>
<p>All Quiet on the Western Front is written by a german about the german side in WW1. Slaughterhouse five is distinctly anti-war and anti-American in many ways, as is a Rumour of War. All three of the books I have recommended show the pointlessness of war, and a Rumour of War provides a great example of how world powers can’t interfere with small nations for their own purposes.</p>
