    <title>What is faster between these two methods of opening doors?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-faster-between-these-two-methods-of-opening-doors/477194</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know which one is faster on run time, what do you guys think?

Method one: Loading doors from a .txt like PI does it now.

Method two: Make a task to open the door (delete the door and then spawn another one in its spot, facing a different way) everytime someone clicks on the object.


I need to use method two for one door in a quest and I wasn&#39;t sure if I should make all doors like that.</description>
