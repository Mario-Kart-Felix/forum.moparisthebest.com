    <title>Error js5connect webclient&#39;s 562 (Deobs)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-js5connect-webclients-562-deobs/446863</link>
    <description>are you getting something like: error js5 connect on the 562 loading 602 doeb&#39;s client? Well I have a solution.
First of all what is happening is that your webclient&#39;s cache is corrupted or not downloaded properly.
So what i have is very simple:
Chapter 1
-i used winrar zipping. It seems like that is the only way to zip and it work without winzip.
----------------------------
Chapter 2
-i paid mediafire for hot-linking, but you can get a free downloading site that doesn&#39;t just link to a page, but the download (webs, etc.);
----------------------------
Chapter 3
-Changing your code to link




Chapter 1 - Zipping Up
ok so if you have winzip, give it a try, but i recommend winzip, Link: [url=http://www.filewin.com/WinRar/?p=US]http://www.filewin.com/WinRar/?p=US[/url]
Ok so now go into your C Drive and look for the files (C:\[b]562_cache_32v4[/b]). That is probably the corrupted file.
Download my files:  [url=http://www.mediafire.com/file/vu9i8q2vvuq4cyn/testtest.zip]http://www.mediafire.com/file/vu9i8q2vvuq4cyn/testtest.zip[/url] :)
Ok so now save those, and winzip them with winrar and upload them somewhere else, because i might diable hot-linking soon.
Ill show you how to do the very basic, winrar zipping, pics below:

Chapter 2 - MediaFire/Download Host
I used mediafire because it is very fast, however if you don&#39;t pay and link your file to the site, the download won&#39;t work because Hot linking is not available. Hot Linking is so you can link straight to the download, and it not go to the page. 
For more info on hot linking click on the following link: [url=http://support.mediafire.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/59/6/directhot-linking--disabling-auto-hotlinking]http://support.mediafire.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/59/6/directhot-linking--disabling-auto-hotlinking[/url].
So your other options are to find a site that enables hot linking, like a website builder, and just use it for that. Please don&#39;t use my link, because i might disable its hot-linking and it will not work

Chapter 3 - Changing Code to Link
Ok so when you run it you still get an error due to that you haven&#39;t changed your qs.java file to download the right stuff.
go int to qs.java and find:

[code]public static File a(boolean bool, int i, String string,
			 String string_1_) {[/code]
and add this over the old stuff, figure out what to delete please:

[code]try {
		if (!CacheDownloaded) {
			File file = new File(&quot;C:/562_cache_32v4/RevengeScapeCache&quot;);
			
			if (!file.exists()) {
					client.downloadCache(&quot;http://download843.mediafire.com/2b1iy3ozmpig/zitfdu5riv2acov/562_cache_32v4.zip&quot;,                          &quot;562Cachev4.zip&quot;,&quot;C:/562_cache_32v4/&quot;, &quot;562Cache&quot;);
					
					client.downloadCache(&quot;Your Link Here&quot;, &quot;testtest.zip&quot;,&quot;C:/562_cache_32v4/&quot;, &quot;testtest&quot;);
					
					CacheDownloaded = true;
			} else {
			CacheDownloaded = true;
			}
		}[/code]



DONE!
Compile and run, any errors/problems please let me know, also i haven&#39;t done this in a while so i might have forgot something or messed up. please let me know!</description>
