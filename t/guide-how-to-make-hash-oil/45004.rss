    <title>[Guide] How to make Hash oil</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/guide-how-to-make-hash-oil/45004</link>
    <description>This is one of the ways I know how to do it, although there are many ways, this I have found is the simplest way.

Items Needed:


[ul][li]Porcelain pot or heat resistant pyrex bowl, one which is suitable for use in the oven.[/li]
[li]cast iron skillet (frying pan larger than the porcelin pot)[/li]
[li]Coffee filters (the re-usable gold filters work very well as well, these can be bought at supermarkets)[/li]
[li]2 bowls[/li]
[li]isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol, try and get something that is 99% pure)[/li][/ul]


Take 1 coffee filter, and place your marijuana in it. Pour the alcohol over the marijuana in the coffee filter so that the alcohol drains into one of the bowls. Squeeze every bit of the alcohol from the marijuana into the bowl.

Now transfer the same marijuana into a clean coffee filter, and use the same alcohol to pour over it again into the second bowl.

Keep repeating this over and over again. If you have a problem with the coffee filters breaking apart while you are squeezing the marijuana, use 2 or 3 coffee filters at a time. The alcohol will turn green.

Next, take the iron skillet set it on the stove, and put the porcelain pot into the skillet. Fill the skillet with water. 


[ul][li]Alcohol is extrememly flamable. Don&#39;t be stupid, be CAREFUL![/li]
[li]Do not cook the alcohol over the open flame. The water in the skillet assists in preventing the alcohol from getting too hot and helps to prevent the alcohol from igniting on fire.[/li]
[li]Ensure your kitchen has good ventelation. Use the stove fan and other fans to move the air around in order to prevent fumes from gathering in one place and igniting.[/li][/ul]


Let the alcohol in the porcelain pot in the skillet simmer on &quot;[b]LOW[/b]&quot;. Make sure the skillet remains full of water. The alcohol will evaporate very very quickly. Make sure you do not let it evaporate too quickly or burn the alcohol.

Once all the alcohol has been evaporated off, you will be left with hash oil. Take a razor blade and scrape it up and smoke it.

<p>… if you smoke 2 times your body wait lmao</p>
<p>EDIT: technically marijuana is a drug because, it has to be man-made or altered in some way… and that could be picking the buds off of the plant…<br>
the last time a looked at wikipedia it said “natural things are often referd to as drugs because of there drug like effects” or something like that…</p>
<p>now they have changed it and they added this to the top “ANY ONE WHO IS READING THIS DRUGS ARE BAD! DO NOT TAKE THEM IF THEY ARE OFFERED TO YOU BY ANY ONE AND DO NOT DO THEM PERIOD! OR ELSE!!!”</p>
<p>kind of ridiculous!</p>

^^ Marijuana is a drug. Alcohol is a drug. Sugar is a drug. Everything that changes your minds state is a drug. It all depends on how you define drugs, although the definition of a drug is a substance that affects the central nervous system. I just say that some drugs are not as bad as what most people think.<br>

<p>Feel free to look up the defintion of a drug, 2 of which have already been posted in this thread. A drug does not have to be man-made, that’s just pure bullshit.</p>

take it this way, just like tobacco, which is used to heal cow bruises(natural reason of existence) but used for smoking(man-made reason of existence), marijuana is probably supposed to be used for a different cause than smoking, and it’s natural use has been overrided with man-made abuse in some form or fashion.</p>
<p>For ALL you KNOW sugar could be a drug, but it can be used in everything for taste, yet you really can’t do anything else with the plant that it comes from, as long as you use its’ NATURAL use, then your good. And that is why herbal remedies exist.</p>

<p>lol i remember that in 8th grade. we had to take 2 weeks of health.  when i was in 9th, we took a whole semester of health as a manditory elective <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  The lady kept telling us that you can overdose and die… I kept arguing back that there is no incident where anybody has died unless they were mixing.  I hated that class so much.  Especially because when we got to the abstinance section, our teacher kept telling us to not use condoms and to just be strait abstinant until you are married.  Its funny because she was 33 and has a 17 year old daughter in my grade <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> (she had to be like…16)</p>
