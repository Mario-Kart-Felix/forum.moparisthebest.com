    <description>the title doesnt say it all...
I was able to get the strength bonus to work in my server.. but i cant figure out anything else.. i have put 5 months of work into this server so far and i believe it is now time to get it all working.. does anybody know a code that would get at least range and mage atk bonuses working? possibly defence bonuses as well?

NOTE: this meaning that if i had 1300 range bonus i would hit the same with a bow if i was 0</description>

              <p>say you have 1300 range bonus… you will hit 1-15 MAX with range… and if you were 1 range bonus… you will still hit the same… the bonuses dont work according to how high they are… only the strength does… i just need the codes on where to put those</p>
