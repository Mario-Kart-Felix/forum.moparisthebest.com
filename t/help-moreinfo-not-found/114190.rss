    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-moreinfo-not-found/114190</link>
    <description>ok here it goes,
I did everything that was written, and it actualy work
i succesfully login, but the problem is the blackscreen always there
and even thought it says please-wait, stuff like that, i automaticly log out each time.
And a testscape, server run,it says this.
-legendofjon has signe into the server
-legendofjon: more info not found
that is all that is missing for it to work.
