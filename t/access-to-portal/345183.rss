    <description>Hey guys I have a donator island on my server which obviously only donators can go to. But on the island it has a store with like full PVP armor for really cheap and I don&#39;t want to raise the prices. I want to make it so only people who donated over 20 dollars can go there but people who donated less still get the Dollar sign crown. Will this involve me making another thing such as super-donator or can i Just add it to the character file as super-donator = 0 or 1.

Thanks :)</description>
