              <p>Hello.<br>
I think that some people worry too much about their status in communities.<br>
You should only be concerned with the quality of your own contributions, and helping people in need.<br>
I think some people are actively seeking out and trying to degrade others, and I think this is wrong. If you feel that someone is degrading the quality of the forum, you should message an administrator and not create fights where people will take sides and defend each other, spread stupid insults and attacks. Just ignore the offending posts, because you will not improve anything by posting negatively. There is a “report post” button, and your own ability to ignore; an unbumped and poorly made post will quickly dissapear.</p>

Xerxes got banned, what does that tell you? That having the last word is normally the worst thing to do.</p>

And James, stop making accusations that people have no lives when you don’t even know them.</p>

<p>Who gives a fuck if I break the rules or not? I NEVER said <strong>I</strong> read the rules, you said YOU read the rules and continue to break them, for all you know I could be a strange forienger that can’t speak english.</p>
<p>When you run a script, you are bound to get somthing out of this, I’ll take StarBlaster’s StressMiner, you run it, you get essence. You sell the essence and gradually get millions from this, you sell the millions and get real life money.</p>
<p>No one is saying SCAR is better than Aryan. NO ONE. I’m 100% sure you brought Aryan into this topic just to prove how SCAR is crap, yet why did Aryan get so detectable? Hmm? Oh I’m sure if you ask Fawki about his accounts, you’ll see levels made and probally never will beable to gain by Aryan unless in it’s very early days. Yes, it was possible but take the ban rate, SCAR &gt; Aryan, I’m sure it’ll stay like this for another year.</p>

First off, I think you need to get a life when you start spitting virtually over the internet.
<p>About the insulting and superior thing: I guess you’d know alot about that topic. You’re the one who always insults people, spams everywhere and tells people to go die.</p>
<p>I think you need to get your facts straight before attempting to post.</p>
<p>This is my last post, I’m not going to bother replying anymore. You may have the time to sit around, staring at the computer screen, waiting to try and fight me. But i actually have a life.
