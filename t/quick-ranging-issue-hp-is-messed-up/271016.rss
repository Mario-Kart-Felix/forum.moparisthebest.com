    <title>Quick ranging issue (HP is messed up)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quick-ranging-issue-hp-is-messed-up/271016</link>
    <description>I downloaded DefaultScape, and when I attack with range, it messes up when the NPC dies.  Using men as examples, they only have 7 hp.  I fiddled with the range maxHit, and my hits aren&#39;t too high.  However, when the NPC has &lt;= 0 HP, my attacks are extremely high (20+) and their HP goes to 230 something.  I just would like it to be so you can&#39;t hit higher than a 7 on men, and once they hit 0, their HP bar says 0/7 and then that&#39;s the end of it.

Thanks.

Note: Mage works fine.</description>
