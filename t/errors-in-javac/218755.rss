    <title>Errors in Javac</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/errors-in-javac/218755</link>
    <description>So i decompressed my clients .jar file to get to the mudclient class file, after i got this, i used jad to decompile the mudclient to a .jad file, which i later changed into a .java file, so that it could be viewed in notepad as readable code, as soon as i tried to compile it using javac (this is without changing anything around) i got these errors.

line 100 illegal start of expression goto _L1
line 102 illegal start of expression goto _L2
line 175 not a statement e;
line 6252 illegal start of expression if(true) goto _L2 else goto _L1
line 6252 illegal start of expression of (true) goto _L2; else goto _L1

I&#39;m not exactly sure how i got these errors if i didn&#39;t change anything after getting the class into a  java file.
Could someone shed some light on the subject, and perhaps direct me as to how i could fix these errors.(maybe its a quick fix, but otherwise you would probably need the .java file itself).[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 09, 2008, 05:45:52 PM[/size][hr]bump for great justice.</description>
