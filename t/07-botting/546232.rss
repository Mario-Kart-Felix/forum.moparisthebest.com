              <p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:8, topic:546232”]I’ve only met one person that’s been banned for botting though they weren’t. And that was Arham. (Still waiting on confirmation, I find it bs.)<br>
However, RuneScape has an amazing system on how they ban botters.<br>
They have admitted that they do not ban a botter instantly, that would be too easy and to boring.<br>
Instead, once you’ve been flagged as a botter, the system will ban you at random.<br>
It could be 3 months after, and you randomly get hit.</p>
<p>I can’t find the article where they said it randomly busts you, but am looking (kinda)</p>

<p>Just enjoy the game and get your skills back I hate people that bot it’s not fair.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree and disagree with you.</p>
<p>While botters are an issue in game, not all of them are. I remember back when they did one of the first Bot Nukes… In about a months time all resource prices went up by around 100% or more. Raw Swordfish you bought at 500gp were now 2k, and cooked were still the low price of 500-600gp. Thus making it a loss to cook anything (but the fishing markets were great).</p>
<p>Botters make skilling cheaper, since they collect most of the resources for you and dump them into the market.<br>
Most people will skill enough for themselves, or sell to the market only for profit. Bots typically just sell and sell.</p>
<p>Now, on the opposite side of the argument. Botters also make it harder to get profit from resource collecting skills. They drop the price of resources (see, both good and bad) making it so when you sell them, you get less money per.[/quote]</p>
<p>lol yah I remember that sharks went up so much too and like you said they also drop the price in the resource collecting skills because they just mass sell them. The real reason I hate them is because while everyone else is grinding to get there skills up and cash stack higher there doing nothing.</p>

              <p>I’ve only met one person that’s been banned for botting though they weren’t. And that was Arham. (Still waiting on confirmation, I find it bs.)<br>
However, RuneScape has an amazing system on how they ban botters.<br>
They have admitted that they do not ban a botter instantly, that would be too easy and to boring.<br>
Instead, once you’ve been flagged as a botter, the system will ban you at random.<br>
It could be 3 months after, and you randomly get hit.</p>
<p>I can’t find the article where they said it randomly busts you, but am looking (kinda)</p>

<p>I agree and disagree with you.</p>
<p>While botters are an issue in game, not all of them are. I remember back when they did one of the first Bot Nukes… In about a months time all resource prices went up by around 100% or more. Raw Swordfish you bought at 500gp were now 2k, and cooked were still the low price of 500-600gp. Thus making it a loss to cook anything (but the fishing markets were great).</p>
<p>Botters make skilling cheaper, since they collect most of the resources for you and dump them into the market.<br>
Most people will skill enough for themselves, or sell to the market only for profit. Bots typically just sell and sell.</p>
<p>Now, on the opposite side of the argument. Botters also make it harder to get profit from resource collecting skills. They drop the price of resources (see, both good and bad) making it so when you sell them, you get less money per.</p>
