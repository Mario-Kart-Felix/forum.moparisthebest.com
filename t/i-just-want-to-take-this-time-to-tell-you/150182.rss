    <description>I want to tell everyone some great products that are free that Microsoft released. These products are great for web design and all of that. You can also get optional downloads such as J script (J #, advanced Java). Please dont spam this thread becouse of 2 reasons

1. Spaming is pathetic and only for noobs
and
2. Theres no use. If a mod would like this closed, please tell me or close it yourself.


I do suggest downloading Web develepment and Visual C # if you are planing on geting a webclient with a website.(or just any website) They will help A LOT!
