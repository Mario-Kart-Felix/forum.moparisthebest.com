    <title>Pali 508 Skillcape help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pali-508-skillcape-help/434905</link>
    <description>So I have skillcapes all worked out, the only problem is no matter what level you are, you can equip it.

Example: Someone makes an account, then they buy a skillcape. They&#39;re able to wear it but not do the emote.

I want to make it so they cannot equip the skillcape until level 99
How do I fix this? D:</description>
