    <title>Avoid &#39;blocked site&#39;s&quot; at school</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/avoid-blocked-sites-at-school/14670</link>
    <description>I just found this out a few days ago, and it works at my school. (My protection is Surfcontrol, but i don&#39;t think it cares)
Ofcourse it will not work for everyone, but at least you can give it a try.

Mostly all schools are using Internet Explorer, which sucks. So:
Download Firefox and install it, at your school pc. (If it says access denied, you were proberly trying to write to C: or whatever).

Go to the Extra -&gt; Options panel, and click connection settings (or whatever it&#39;s called, i use a dutch version :P). Fill in the standard proxy of your school (if they use it, otherwise you&#39;re doomed). Like mine is EX-WB01. I just found out while watching the Internet Explorer settings. So try, in my case, the proxy on port [b]8080[/b] or [b]80[/b]. Press OK and try to browse some site&#39;s. If they&#39;re still blocked, kill your administrator or try another proxy server, but otherwise it will work.

Oh, one note. If you have M$ web exchange mail (Looks like windows live mail) the proxy is shown in the address bar. (For me http://EX-WB01/exchange).

I would like to recieve some feedback if it did worked (or not). :)
