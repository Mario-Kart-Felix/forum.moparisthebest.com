    <description>i want too create a code that if someone is in a certain area, and they are not staff, or have been jailed they die. i can do the staff part with if playrights, but how can i determine if someone is in jail or not? it wouldnt be isinjail() as thats just the area where jail is? or does that determine if someone has been jailed or not?

thanks alot.</description>

              <p>you need to add that bit for the area you want enclosed. like if you didn’t want non-staff in falador you would make it say all people at player rights 0 or below they die upon entering the area.</p>
