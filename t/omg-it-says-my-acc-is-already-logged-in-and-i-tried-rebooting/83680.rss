    <title>Omg, it says my acc is already logged in, and i tried rebooting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/omg-it-says-my-acc-is-already-logged-in-and-i-tried-rebooting/83680</link>
    <description>ok, so i recently added a mime skill, and now whenever i start my server up it logs in and then says that your account is already online, and no-one can sign on!!
no errors in my runserver

so when i added the mime skill i made some public voids,

[code]
public void Mime1()// (c) by Teh_hacker
	{
	if(playerLevel[33] &gt;= 1)
		{
		addSkillXP((1000*playerLevel[33]), 33);
		startAnimation(0x46B);
		addItem(3057, 1);
		sendMessage(&quot;You get trapped in a box, but you just annoy the crowd&quot;);
		}
		else if(playerLevel[33] &lt; 1)
		{
			sendMessage(&quot;You need at least 1 mime lvl to do this emote!&quot;);
		}
	}

public void Mime2()// (c) by Teh_hacker
	{
	if(playerLevel[33] &gt;= 50)
		{
		addSkillXP((15000*playerLevel[33]), 33);
		startAnimation(0x46A);
		addItem(3058, 1);
		sendMessage(&quot;You pretend to climb a rope, it breaks, and you&#39;re still annoying&quot;);
		}
		else if(playerLevel[33] &lt; 50)
		{
			sendMessage(&quot;You need at least 50 mime lvl to do this emote!&quot;);
		}
	}

public void Mime3()// (c) by Teh_hacker
	{
	if(playerLevel[33] &gt;= 99)
		{
		addSkillXP((30000*playerLevel[33]), 33);
		startAnimation(0x469);
		addItem(3059, 1);
		sendMessage(&quot;You pretend to lean on a wall, but constructions workers tear it down&quot;);
		sendMessage(&quot;P.S. You&#39;re still annoying&quot;);
		}
		else if(playerLevel[33] &lt; 50)
		{
			sendMessage(&quot;You need at least 99 mime lvl to do this emote!&quot;);
		}
	}
public void Mime4()// (c) by Teh_hacker
	{
	if(playerLevel[33] &gt;= 135)
		{
		addSkillXP((100000*playerLevel[33]), 33);
		startAnimation(0x468);
		addItem(3060, 1);
		addItem(3061, 1);
		sendMessage(&quot;You imagine that there is a glass wall in front of you....&quot;);
		sendMessage(&quot;You start to feel for a door....&quot;);
		sendMessage(&quot;Annoyed, someone pushes you into the wall and it breaks and kills you&quot;);
		}
		else if(playerLevel[33] &lt; 135)
		{
			sendMessage(&quot;You need at least 135 mime lvl to do this emote! Holy Frick!!&quot;);
		}
	}
[/code]
is the id for the skill too high? i made my skill thingy like playerLevel[33], is that too big, if it is, i&#39;ll change it


if not, this is what my mime emote&#39;s look like(i used them to make the mime exp)

[code]
								                            case 2155: // glass box emote
{
Mime1();
}		
								                            case 25103: // climb rope emote
{
Mime2();
}
								                            case 25106: // lean emote
{
Mime3();
}
								                            case 2154: // glass wall emote
{
Mime4();
}
[/code]

is there anything wrong? other than that, all i added was the things it told me to add in the &quot;make your own skills&quot; tut, basically, it&#39;s just this and all those ints for making a new skill


does anyone know why this might have happened!!!!????[br][size=1]Posted on: April 22, 2007, 06:35:31 PM[/size][hr]help me please</description>

              <p>Well it can’t say “Your account is offline.” you can’t even get that msg in real Runescape, and two check if there is any errors in the runserver.bat and then post them here, right click copy and hit enter then paste the errors here, and I’ll help you out. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
