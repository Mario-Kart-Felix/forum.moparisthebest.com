    <description>[b]7/19/09 message: Im starting to work on my engine more and completing it so i&#39;ve updated this topic and will keep it updated.[/b]


First, i know for a fact no one here will think i made it, due to the scarred history i have left myself in this section.

Second, i did not rip this code, i will appropriately accredit people that have helped me towards the bottom.

I have been working on my engine for about 2 months now, i didn&#39;t start physically writing it until the end of Christmas, early January. 

Also, this isn&#39;t meant for RS models, its just, they have so many colors and polys it would be a challenge to practice loading them than cubes..

I wont release the source until maybe tomorrow or Thursday because...

Its indented, but, :) Its messy.

the only relation this has to jME is that its written in java, but jME is just an abstraction for native rendering libraries</p>

I was not really sure , but as i see i can see even method’s arguments and stuff similar to that of jmonkey’s in the example that you’ve posted, check with your friends that you’v credited.                                                                                          [/quote]</p>
<p>Then you need to learn what 3D engines are all about. JMonkeyEngine is 3rd party software, yet his engine is entirely standalone. Plus, JME uses both LWJGL and JOGL to do it’s rendering. In case you are unaware, both of those are also third party software. They are initially built for hardware-based rendering, but have support for software-based as well (on such machines as laptops, where their graphics cards don’t have the OpenGL or DirectX libraries).</p>
<p>So to be completely honest, you need to do several weeks more of research before accusing someone of doing something wrong, especially when they probably have months more experience than you in this language.</p>

Waste of time… Why don’t you just use OpenGL Java implementations aka “JOGL.”<br>

Lol do you think you know more than everyone everywhere? It is something for him to do and learn from let him make what he wants.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure you have already tried to make yourself look better than others in the Java section over at R~S. But there you have failed and I suggest you don’t try here either. I know for a fact (bobsaget AKA Jim) on R~S knows more than your ass.[/quote]</p>
<p>Please have him or you add my MSN (<a href="mailto:joe.melsha@live.com">joe.melsha@live.com</a>) and I would like to get further into this. (don’t start spamming about this becuase I don’t care.)</p>
