    <title>Teleblock help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/teleblock-help/359206</link>
    <description>Hi, thank you for reviewing my post.  

1.I need help in making the teleblock.When i teleblock someone in my 317 server, they can always use commands to get away.  How do i code it so that you cant use commands to escape when you are teleblocked?  

2.Also how would i make a command that makes a person get teleblocked like.... ::teleblock (playername)  


3.  How would i make a command that teles a person somewhere for example:  I set a command to tele the other person to lumby.  i would do ::lumby (playername)

thank you for answering all my questions i really am greatful for all the people in morparscape.

Thanks again!</description>
