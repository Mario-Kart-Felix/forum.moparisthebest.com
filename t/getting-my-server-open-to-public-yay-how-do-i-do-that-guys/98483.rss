    <title>Getting my server open to public *yay* how do I do that guys?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-my-server-open-to-public-yay-how-do-i-do-that-guys/98483</link>
    <description>I know theres tuts on this but I dont understand them.  Put what you tell me in NEWB LANGUAGE please because i&#39;ve only been doing this for *checks hours* 21 hours.  And thats not over a course of a couple days i&#39;ve kept my computer on all night.

I have my ip.  Its pwnpk.no-ip.org.  I made it at no-ip.com

The next step is.... what?  I dont think I want hamachi.  Well honestly I dont know but this is why.  I just want the kind of server where they go to moparisthebest.com and click &quot;serverstatus list&quot; (which is http://www.flashspace.us/serverstatus.php website) and can find my server listed.  I know that I need to do something with a router.  I know I need to do something with a &quot;port forward&quot;

I have a very very very vauge idea of what either of these are please be desriptive thankyou.</description>

              <p>ive made a couple guides on this on one of my old sites let me see if I can find them… ah yes here they are.</p>
<p>heres how to set up a no-ip  ect.</p>
<p>I decided to make this little guid based off what I had to do to get server up and running. Hope u all enjoy.</p>
<p>K first off go download winrar. I recomend going on <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a> and and searching for free winrar lol. NOTE (winrar is what makes it so u can actually download sources exc.)</p>
<p>K second off u need to get a server source. Download and save it to your documents. I recomend Testscape for new coders and PVP scape or Pimpscape for advanced. NOTE; i will not be releasing my source ;p.</p>
<p>Now once uve done all of that u should see a pile off books in your documents that says eather Testscape or w/e source u downloaded. Right click those and then click extract and then ok. No u should have a folder with the same name as the books. Open it and find Client.java. Right click Client.java and click open with and use notepad. Now u may start editing stuff. I recomend asking in tut forum for help with added stuff.</p>
<p>Now Go to <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> and register. Once ur done log on and look at the left of the screen for somthing that says host/redirects and clickHos add. Click it and where it says Hostname and change to what u want ur no-ip to be. then under that u can click the drop down thing and pic if u want no-ip.info, <a href="http://no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.org</a>, no-ip.biz, ect. Now dont touch anything else just scroll down to where it says create host and click that. No u have a proper host</p>
<p>K for the part where u make it so every one else can get on. Click downloads at top of screen on <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> and choose what type of software u have(weather it be mac, windows, lunix, ect.) and download it to ur desktop. Open it and do all the stuff it says. Then when u get the pop up with ur server ip in it check the box beside ur servers ip. NOTE (There will only be one thing in there). Once uve click and u should hav server ready to go online.</p>
<p>Now go into ur documents and open ur server again. Now open Runeserver.bat. And there u go just log on now.</p>
<p>:Pics:<br>

<img src="http://i160.photobucket.com/albums/t170/Santaowner/downloads.jpg" alt width="" height=""><br>
completely 100% by my</p>
<p>this is my noob guide for basic stuff</p>
<p>welp here it is the one i promissed it just covers some stuff that the guy was having problems with and i made in like 10 min so its pretty bad but o’well notice some of stuff will be out of date…</p>
<p>some very helpfull places to help build/modify ur server are: <a href="http://moparscape.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">moparscape.no-ip.org</a>, x-cel-psc.com~very good site~ and <a href="http://dodian.com" rel="nofollow noopener">dodian.com</a></p>
<p>first off id like to start with making admins and mods.<br>
first go into the client.java folder (extract it with notepad) and search for Start of mod<br>
you should see this<br>
//start of moderator/admin list, 1 = mod, 2 = staff, 3 = admin</p>
<p>/<em>checkmods();<br>
checkadmins();<br>
checkstaff();<br>
if(checkmods() == 5)<br>
playerRights = 1;<br>
if(checkadmins() == 5 || playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(“Javis”))<br>
playerRights = 2;<br>
if(checkstaff() == 5 || playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(“Santa”) || playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(“Jas0n”))<br>
playerRights = 3;</em>/</p>
<p>if (playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(“Santa”))<br>
{<br>
playerRights = 3;<br>
}</p>
<p>change the santa to your user name. Also change the Jas0n to who ever is co owner.</p>
<p>now go into you character folder and find your name/file. Open it and look for the part where it  says character rights. for owner change to 3, for admin change to a 2, for mod change to 1, and for reg person it should be a 0. I already made u owner so dont worry bought your account.</p>
<p>Now to get ur server online go to <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> and register. log onto your name and click on add at the left side of the screen. Once u get for the host name add your server name + you can use the drop down arrow to change it from no-ip.biz to stuff like no-ip.info <a href="http://no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.org</a> exc. k now leavce everything else the same and scroll down tell u find create host and revert buttons beside ea other. click create host.it will make you server now at the top of the no-ip page click on the tab that says downloads and find what type of computer u hav (mac,windows, exc) and download it to ur computer.</p>
<p><s>LAUNCHING AND COMPILING IMPORTANT</s><br>
k to launch you server first open the no-ip window that should be already downloaded on your computer (more than likely in documents foldier) and check the box beside the name of ur server so the smilie goes from a cool dude to a happy face. no go into your server foldier ( this one that u downloaded and open the runserver thing. now all u have to do is log on and go put ur server on places like codefasga.</p>
<p>LOL HOPE U ENJOID THE GUIDE</p>

              <p>I know theres tuts on this but I dont understand them.  Put what you tell me in NEWB LANGUAGE please because i’ve only been doing this for <em>checks hours</em> 21 hours.  And thats not over a course of a couple days i’ve kept my computer on all night.</p>
<p>I have my ip.  Its <a href="http://pwnpk.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">pwnpk.no-ip.org</a>.  I made it at <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a></p>
<p>The next step is… what?  I dont think I want hamachi.  Well honestly I dont know but this is why.  I just want the kind of server where they go to <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> and click “serverstatus list” (which is <a href="http://www.flashspace.us/serverstatus.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.flashspace.us/serverstatus.php</a> website) and can find my server listed.  I know that I need to do something with a router.  I know I need to do something with a “port forward”</p>
<p>I have a very very very vauge idea of what either of these are please be desriptive thankyou.</p>
