One of the cleanest servers out there. client.java only 60kbs. .rar file is only 92kbs. This is the packaged server if you would like the unpackaged server, check this link.

A quote from one, programmer that i think will go far, Fission.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, Devo and me do not mix well. RS001 failed hard with all the bugs with Single-threaded... so, I am doing something cool.

WinterLove, no, not a derivative, thee winterLove. I see a whole lot of people who are put off by WinterLove because it&#39;s packaged, basic, and just not &quot;friendly.&quot; Personally, I believe that is a big lie. Packaging is better in my eyes. But, lets take a step back and make this user friendly for these people.

Single-threaded, EventManager... Things like this (Btw, thanks for those Graham!) make advances, and help winterLove allot. So, the goal... Get this to a stable, small form factor, and release. Get the minimums, get them right the first time, get them working.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>I ran a server once for 4 days, and stopped it. It wasn’t fun. For some reason making and releasing is funner for me then hosting/making a game.</p>

Go open another hamachi server and get over it, H @ X 0 R don’t even talk to him like that cause your name suggests your an 8 year old hermaphrodite.<br>

<p>I just started this project. He asked me to give him a copy. (Only did 3 fixes about so far, enabled the player saving etc) so I did. He re-packaged it.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT the final WinterFission, this is build 1 of about 50.</p>

<p>Stupit, the features I listed in my post aren’t in there yet just to let you know. I am still implementing <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> I did like 2 things to lol. So thats why everyone’s reacting as they did.</p>
<p>Let’s take a breather, and realize this isn’t a final project yet, then lets post with a cool head.</p>
<p>@ Alec. Yes wL is bad. But not all are ready to switch to Hyperion yet. At least a winterLove with optimizations is better then Delta, far better.</p>
