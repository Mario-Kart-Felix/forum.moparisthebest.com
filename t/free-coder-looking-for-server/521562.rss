    <title>[FREE] coder looking for server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/free-coder-looking-for-server/521562</link>
    <description>hey im new to coding and i was looking for a server who would allow me to try and code on their source and play with the players, im still learning and not the best but im willing to take on any challenge appointed to me.

why should you choose me?
~im 100% free of charge
~im nice and very friendly
~i like to help out ingame and behind the scenes
~im a great rsps player 
~did i mention im free? 

all i am asking for is co-owner or coder title and some recognition for the stuff i do  

what can i do?
~i can make custom places with special designs (like a boss cave with scenes everywhere and bosses to battle, a maze with a great reward at the end, etc)
~i can rework npc drops
~i can re write what npc&#39;s say
~i can change shops and prices
~i can change weapon stats

what am i working on?
~im working on giving items new abilities (like one idea i had was giving a sword the ability to hit 2 times each time it would normally hit, like a dbow, but still have the same speed as a sword, it would ofcourse be weaker but would be cool to see how players would use this, another was to make a weapon that has a chance of critical hits, and some specials weapons that could drain stats etc randomly)
~working on adding new commands that could help the server (some server come with few commands so you have to work alot through the files, like when trying to give donor some servers have to go into files and rewrite the permissions instead of having ::givedonor)
~adding custom minigames
~custom bosses
~custom items

<p>Also, you keep saying the word ‘‘free’’ But i also saw that you’re new to coding.<br>
Coding is fun and that’s why people do it without ‘free’ ‘new coders’</p>
