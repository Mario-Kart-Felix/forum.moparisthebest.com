    <description>Hi i&#39;m Jinrake. [u][b]LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO HIRE ME TO CODE ($)[/b][/u]


Half these idiots are selling my code out here and its pretty shitty. I can do custom and unique orders, which is what I most engage my time in. Come at me with custom minigames, skills etc. that you want server code developed for. We&#39;ll chat about prices.

I can also fix errors you have no idea of how to fix. And speed up your server&#39;s cycling times.

Many people on this forum can vouch for me. I have literally a tonne of sources that people have sent to me to work on which have never seen the daylight [i.e. you can trust me with your code. I have no intentions to release it or fuck you over...]


E-Mail: Jinrakexxx (at) googlemail.com contact me there for A$AP replies.

Skype: j1nrake

Previous work: PVP Planet. Jinrake 459. I have got much more experience since then. HMU.

[UPDATE] - bump new PI Engine for sale [JRS Engine V3], Player Updating, Ticking, NPC Processing, Handling made. Benchmarks are crazy good. Skype Me.

Engine peformance:

Heres the Benchmarks: [Tested on Home PC [Shit Specs, 2GB Ram Pent 4.] Flooded by external computer on diff network.]. There was no max ip limit too. Blank PI base literally. I just put my engine on it for a guy.
