    <title>Quite a few problems with a BRAND new server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quite-a-few-problems-with-a-brand-new-server/178110</link>
    <description>Ok guys I&#39;m sorry about this lengthy list of problems but whatever you can help me out on or point me the right way is very much appreciated. If this is the wrong forum for this please let me know. Ok here&#39;s the list of problems(for starters):
1. Character does not face the right direction when fighting.
2. Character needs no ammo for magic bow.
3. How would I go about adding items into the game itself (not to vendors) I mean  like to actually add items such as skillcapes and godswords.
4.I&#39;m having big problems with blood runes, when I have em it says I dont, then when I bank em they turn to ecto-tokens (think testscape it was supposed to do that.
5. Ok so I have testscape and the moparscape client along with hamachi, can teh only way people can join my server is to download hamachi as well then go from there????
6.why wont my npc&#39;s attack/walk toward you when you initiate a range/mage combat
7.how do I lower exp rates and drop rates to not be soo gosh darn high??

I will I guess edit this post with more questions as I delve further into this exploration xD, any help is appreciated, thanks.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 03, 2008, 02:13:32 AM[/size][hr]if anyone is out there and can help please do</description>
