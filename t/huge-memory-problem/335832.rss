    <title>Huge memory problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/huge-memory-problem/335832</link>
    <description>Ok, I have this huge problem with a server I&#39;m hosting.

When I start up the server, it uses about 30mb ram. So far so good.
But after a few seconds, the usage jumps up to 80mb, and a few seconds later it&#39;s well over 100mb and rising.
The highest I&#39;ve seen it so far was 300mb, with just 2 people on.
But, I&#39;ve also had it on for hours with 15+ people and it would just use 50-90mb.

What could be the cause of this?
This problem only started to show earlier today, and has been happening ever since.
I can&#39;t even run the server for more then 5 minutes before it uses a heckload of ram now.

I didn&#39;t change anything about the server in days, so I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not because of something new I added.

What the hell can be the problem, this is driving me mad ._.</description>

              <p>To be completely honest with you, you should probably just switch to a different server base that doesn’t eating up your RAM. Try out Hyperion or a server with thread-per-client removed.</p>
