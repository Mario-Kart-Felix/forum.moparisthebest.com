    <title>718+ npc Hit through pray</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-npc-hit-through-pray/519985</link>
    <description>I was wondering how i could change an npc to hit through prayer, atm i have an npc i use as a boss (ballak) And Players can camp at him for hours on end, i even made his stats very op and his health very large but people still just sit there and beat him, i have tried to search around and see however since i added ballak without any special attacks or sounds i dont have an npc file for him (Ballak.java) i was thinking about just creating one however if i do so how would i change it so he can hit through prayer, or even if there is a simplier way for me to this? thanks</description>

              <p>I see this is a 718 thread, maybe you can help me and when I find something about this I will tell you?<br>
Since you have a 718, maybe you know where to change multipliers for shops and price checker which determine price of item in price of an item in price check or shop, because in price check the price tends to be something like 2.7x higher than normal price and shop 1/3 price and this is not what I am looking for.</p>
