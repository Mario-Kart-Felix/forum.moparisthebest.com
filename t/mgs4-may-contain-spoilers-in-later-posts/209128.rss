    <description>Anyone who has a ps3, download the newest trailier is fucking amazing. It also gives away a bit of the &quot;Sad&quot; storyline where we see the end of &#39;solid snake&#39;, its weird in a way, after playing every single metal gear solid since first one, in which is considered by many the best/most important game of all time seeing the end of snake is pretty sad, which for me is very weird because i never feel sad/sorry for any characters in films, t.v shows etc when they die and this is a game!

Oh and the graphics in this trailier seem a little off compared to the ones in the game play videos, which is also surprising since its always the traliers that look better than the actual gameplay. So, is anyone who has a ps3 getting this? if you have not thought of it, i do strongly suggest getting it, even if you have not been a fan of the older games, buy it for the experience, buy it for the storyline, buy it because its one of the greatest game sequels ever. 

ps; suicide is not a joke..</description>

              <p>One draw back i’ve found although it can be a good thing is that the story and the gameplay sucks you into it, so much that you can play it for hours without noticing so you could end up finishing it very fast.<br>
I’m on the last act now after 13 hours of gameplay (I have gone through it very fast) yet it seems weeks since i started it although it was only yesterday.</p>
<p>One extra thing i love, is that the cut scenes are rendered fully in real time and you can use the small metal gear robot to go around the aeroplane where you get most of your mission briefings, its <span class="bbcode-i">technically</span> one of the best games ever made. You would be stupid not to get it, unless you are not a fan of that type of game.</p>
<p>I fucking love this game, over the 10 years since the first metal gear solid on playstation you get attached to snake as i’ve never been by anything before.<br>
It’ll be sad to see snake go, there is so many sad moments during this game seeing the people, not just snake that you have seen in all the metal gears before this one die. I’ll be singing this games praises for as long as i live, sounds sad, but you know, i’m a gamefreak and probably always will be.</p>

<p>By the amount of space it uses it sounds like its going to be a fantastic and long game.</p>

<p>That better not be a spoiler!</p>
<p>I sort of was sucked into the MGS franchise, when I first got a playstation my uncle bought me it, and it was always one of those games which felt out of my league. Slowly as I grew older I completed it. Then one day while shopping with my mum I saw mgs2 on the shelve for only £10 so I decided to see how it was. After that I bowered mgs3 from one of my friends and spent a whole day playing through the story. I remember how beautiful the ending was and how sad it made me feel.</p>
<p>Tbh Metal Gear Solid is more like an interactive movie than a game.</p>

              <p>Anyone who has a ps3, download the newest trailier is fucking amazing. It also gives away a bit of the “Sad” storyline where we see the end of ‘solid snake’, its weird in a way, after playing every single metal gear solid since first one, in which is considered by many the best/most important game of all time seeing the end of snake is pretty sad, which for me is very weird because i never feel sad/sorry for any characters in films, t.v shows etc when they die and this is a game!</p>
<p>Oh and the graphics in this trailier seem a little off compared to the ones in the game play videos, which is also surprising since its always the traliers that look better than the actual gameplay. So, is anyone who has a ps3 getting this? if you have not thought of it, i do strongly suggest getting it, even if you have not been a fan of the older games, buy it for the experience, buy it for the storyline, buy it because its one of the greatest game sequels ever.</p>
