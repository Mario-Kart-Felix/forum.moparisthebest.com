[b]make money[/b]
When first starting out you pop up in edgeville.  There is a nice area where you can immediately start mining or fishing to make money.  
If this skilling is not your cup of tea then the monsters in edgeville drops decent to get you started out fast.
chickens drops coins, 9 man drops up to addy 2h, full iron, decent coins.  
31 Skellys drop decent stuff and coins, 
Guards drop decent coins and random ruby ammys.
Once you feel confident then you can venture in the wilderness where you wil get double experience rates.  Also, the monsters in the wilderness drop good stuff.
13 alter is filled with lesser demons and outside is a couple of greaters.. dropping decents cash and up to rune b axes, and r2h&#39;s. 
::Dragons range them and loot.
Black Demons drop rune armours and wepons, coins, bloods, deaths and they are found in the wilderness north of the castle inside of the bandit camp....
if you dont want to walk then simply use the portal in edgeville to get there.
LAVA maze is the prime location where there is green dragons that drop cash bloods and rune weapons. 
at the end of the maze there is a ladder to get to the only king black dragon in the game.

              <p>Coming to SlayPk for the first time we now have a refer a friend program to get a benefit from doing so.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Referring a friend to Play with us here at slaypk will gain you a free Subscription for 3 days, which has many benefits.</span></p>
<p>Also,There is a new skill in the game now called “Pking”.<br>
When pking in the wilderness will have 3 options- kill someone higher level than you, kill someone lower level than you, or die.<br>
Killing a player that is higher level than yourself will result in more exp than say, if you were to kill a lower level player.<br>
the catch-- if you die then your pking skill will actually be reduced.  To maintain a high pk level you must keep that kill ratio above your deaths!</p>
<p>Looking into maybe added some clan related stuff for the server.</p>

              <p>Overall unique server, high exp rate is an incentive that takes away that grind feel<br>
New bosses and drops that most servers don’t have is a big plus<br>
Very easy for newcomers to get started in edgeville<br>
Playerbase is relatively helpful at times<br>
Admin is online occasionally</p>
<p>Only suggestions I have is to add more items to shop where skilling isn’t popular eg. more arrows, more ammies, legends cape?, zammy pots, and maybe sharks in general store…</p>
<p>Also have you planned when to release halloween masks or other rares? You could add combat stats to them to take away the purely cosmetic appeal, so people would pk in them</p>
<p>A +1 from me</p>
