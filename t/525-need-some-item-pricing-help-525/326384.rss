    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/525-need-some-item-pricing-help-525/326384</link>
    <description>Hi there, I recently started a RSPS, and I need to code it up so that when you spawn an item (::item 4151 1) It will cost (for example this is a whip) 1.68M, and when you sell it, it will sell for 1.4M.

I also have a lot of items to code up for pricing, but I just need to know HOW to price them like that.

Also, I would like to make some items unavailible to Regular players and player moderators, but availible to Admins. Items like Partyhats and other rares will be unspawnable.

I also would like to know how to code Magic spells so that they can only be used if your a certain magic level, and if you have the required runes. 

If anyone can help me out with this, I&#39;d really appriciate it. 

Thanks.</description>
