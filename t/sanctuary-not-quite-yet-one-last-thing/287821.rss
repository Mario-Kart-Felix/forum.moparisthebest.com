    <title>Sanctuary, Not Quite Yet...One Last Thing!</title>

    <description>Hello Everyone,
  Finally, after talking with the LinkSys support staff I got my router running did a tutorial, and now my port is open. I&#39;m using Devolution X as my base. Well, I think it&#39;s my base anyways, it&#39;s the server I&#39;m running. My question is, with No-Ip DUC running the &quot;runserver.bat&quot; loaded telling me it&#39;s on port 43594 1,000 people max, how do I get into my game make an account and start playing with my friends? How do my friends get into the game? I was thinking I need a client, but where do I get it?

                 Thanks Much,
                     C. Negatory</description>
