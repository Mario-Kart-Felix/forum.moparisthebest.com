    <title>PseudoCode, anyone heard of it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pseudocode-anyone-heard-of-it/390976</link>
    <description>Well, I just finished learning a bit of ASCII, Binary and all that stuff. And now my teacher thought it would be best to teach us a bit of something thats closest to real programming. It&#39;s said that sometime in the far future we would be able to program in PseudoCode, so I got a head start and learned as much as I could in one hour.

I am not a professional so I&#39;m just going to share what I have learned about PseudoCode and hope it may help you or me out a bit.

[code=PseudoCode]IF lights at the intersection went red THEN
     stop at the intersection
ELSE
     drive through the red light
ENDIF[/code]
Correct this if I have something wrong, I really am not telling you what PseudoCode is, I just want to learn.

Also, I am not sure if everything I said at the top of this post was true. Go easy on a script kiddie would ya?</description>

<p>pseudocode can be wrote however you want as long as you understand what is going on. its a way to get you program and logic planned out on paper. u can use it with or without a flowchart. but ya its suppose to help you code better. at least thats what my teacher told us.[/quote]<br>
