    <title>Which OS for PHP?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-os-for-php/207478</link>
    <description>I create websites for people occasionally, and I feel like I should start using PHP instead of simple HTML/CSS (due to rising demand &gt;.&gt; blech). I don&#39;t have a working online server to test PHP websites anymore (as some of you may remember, my old site got shut down when I shared it with the wrong person and he was using his space to exploit IRC with botnet crap &gt;.&gt;), so I&#39;m thinking of using WAMP for now, to start. 

I know that PHP seems to be more suited toward Linux OS&#39;s, so I was wondering if I should dual boot my XP with Ubuntu (which I have had experience with). Will this be necessary, or will I not need the additional compatibility for my uses?

I&#39;m very happy sticking with Windows, but if Linux has an edge that I might need, I&#39;m willing to dual boot.

Thanks in advance,
Ligor</description>

              <p>Sounds like it ^^</p>
<p>If I get a project that requires something that’s not 100% stable on Windows, I should be able to switch to Linux to get the job done. Thanks for the infos Zachera.</p>

              <p>Just a quick note,</p>
<p>Keep in mind that some features/extensions may not work 100% on Windows, so if you anticipate on them all working (I’ve only had problems with the PHP-Java bridge), then you should work off a Linux. Also, such applications as gettext (languge translation), which were made on Unix, have availability for Windows, but they are quite messy to deal with. Throughout my experiences in PHP, I’ve found that if you’re on a Unix system, it’s a much smoother flow dealing with new additions to PHP.</p>

              <p>Thanks Mopman, for the quick response especially. I hoped staying in Windows would be a viable option, and it sounds like I really have no reason to move over to Linux for anything. Saves me the time to download a new Linux distro on my slow internet too xD</p>
<p>Thanks again,<br>
