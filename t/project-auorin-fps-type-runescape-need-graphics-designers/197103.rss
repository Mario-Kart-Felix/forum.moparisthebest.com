    <title>Project: Auorin - fps type runescape, (need graphics designers)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-auorin-fps-type-runescape-need-graphics-designers/197103</link>
    <description>Hey everyone im Burgerman the owner of Auorin, which some of you may know closed down about 3 months ago, and since then i have been working my a** off earning money 48hours a week jobs not fun. but you have to do it to get along in life. 
so i had this idea about a week ago 
to start auorin back up, however i wanted to do it with changes. 
i dont want to use the runescape models.
i want to make it a full screen fps style game like wow.
with new skills, armours, etc.
if i was to make this i would base it off either the sims style *character wise*or the wow engine. or maybe integrate both.
i will need alot of help
i have decided to do this because i am sick of normal private servers they are mostly all the same. 
i have 4 years in the java/graphics industry.
if you want i have created a few buildings in google sketchup whilst waiting for my 3dsmax to arrive. and i will also be using model creators from other games like counter strike mapmaker. to make buildings/mini events etc.
if you would like to join me in this please sign up to
