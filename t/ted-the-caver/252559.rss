They made it very believable with the pictures and stuff.</p>

There are some sites that have 2 extra pages, that supposedly contain some stuff written by his sister. As ThAt0n36Uy said, the story is supposed to stop like that. Ted, Joe and B go back to the cave and never return.<br>

Can’t believe i read everything…</p>
<p>But the story about Ted the caver seems kinda fake.<br>
The main 2 suspicious things are he didnt show us the pictures of the hieroglyphics.<br>
He made that up with a lousy explanation.</p>
<p>The second is because he “forgot” to take the camera with him.</p>
<p>Didn’t even finish his fictional story.<br>

<p>No, by not completing it, leaves you to infer that they did not ever make it out of the cave. It’s obviously fictional, but a very good read nonetheless.</p>
<p>I love suspense, but I also hate it. I love the feeling I get, but I hate the waiting to get to the end, to get the answers.[/quote]</p>
