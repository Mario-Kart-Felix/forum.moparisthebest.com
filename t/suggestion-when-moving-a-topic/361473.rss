    <title>[Suggestion] When moving a topic</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestion-when-moving-a-topic/361473</link>
    <description>Typically this wouldn&#39;t be posted here as this isn&#39;t a suggestion forum (as its obviously General Discussion), but I&#39;d like feedback on this.

I&#39;ve noticed with the constant locked/moved topics, flooding and filling various boards, that when a topic is moved, it should not to remain in the specific board.

Such as this: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,457704.0.html

Can you just move the topic without the thread being there? Because it fills the boards with unnecessary threads. 

(By the way, its nothing personal against SilentCJ, it was only an example)

You guys should private message mitb about it (as I’m not sure if he reads this section very often).<br>
At least with a private message there is a definite chance he will read it.<br>

</aside>
<p>Yes, I would love this.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is an option to not post a topic. But I leave it on so that the poster knows where the topic went, and not just assume it disappeared and then re-post it. If it automatically sent a private message like what Fat Cookies said, that would be nice. It’s just to inform the topic poster, like when I lock a topic, I almost always post so that I can tell them why exactly the topic was locked.</p>
<p>It’s also telling them which section is the correct section for their topic.</p>
