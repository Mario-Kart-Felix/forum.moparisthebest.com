    <title>508 model header with 80% texture support</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-model-header-with-80-texture-support/471127</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to fix this for the past couple days, but i can&#39;t seem to. I&#39;m releasing this outside of my client because its not complete, I want people to take this and try to build off of it.

I&#39;m also releasing this because I want to see rsps progress, so having somewhat working textures is a step in the right direction.

Texturing on old header models works fine, the darkness is because of the 508 version of the old header, it sets the drawtype to 0, so whatever old header models you have will be textured fine.

If you are using like 600+ models or some shit, dont add this because your priorities will be loveed or the models just wont show...

Model Class:

 Note:You may get black maps in certain places because of texturing bugs, seaside port maps in particular (port khazard, port phasmatys, port sarim)

Oh and here are 2 classes from 508 that deal with models, there is alot refactored in both that helped me get this far with texturing in 317, The class named Model may be wrong because there are quite a few classes that deal with models, in particular class1 etc, since I renamed class1_sub4 model I assume class1 is model so a better name May be Model_sub4

[url=http://uppit.com/74os65gq0ink/Class1_Sub3_Sub1.java]Download Class1.Sub3.Sub1.java @ UppIT[/url]
[url=http://uppit.com/wee508rskhcq/Model.java]Download Model.java @ UppIT[/url]

in Class1_sub3_sub1 you can fine the method that resembles 317 that checks the drawtypes to determine the texture method to use.

If you try to add those classes to a 508 client youre just going to get a bunch of errors since I removed dummies and such.

Oh and here are some pictures
