    <description>Me and a mate jeba, are creating 2 unique private servers using a Czar/figment f2p to be exact base, we intend on close to real runescape as in my case no customs, and a very stable economy.
 
Ok, my server is obviously based on Czar, I began working on it after working out my concept about what.. 3 hours ago :P, as my concept is kind of unique i have to make sure i do stuff right (Not to mention i can&#39;t really code anything anyway :p).

Pic that basically explains the concept of my server VVVVV

YES i know its big, it has to be because its basically the same as me writing it all out, just makes it visible to you :P


My server is based on a race concept, You choose at the start if you want to be Falador/Varrock sided, You then talk to the appropriate NPC to recieve your untradeable cape + teleport to the city of your choice. I am going to have it so:

The MAX level possible in all skills is 75, this means no stupid 40-40 hits on enemies, when my main pvp area has no level limits (lvl 75 vs lvl 60 wouldnt be much difference, if pures decide to neglect defence that&#39;s their choice), due to me using czar, the ServerCP handles alot of things, such as my XP rate which is around 120-140, which ISNT that long considering the max is 1.25M xp for level 75 (Estimated).

At the moment as you can see my server is only based around the f2p areas of the 2006 runescape (took me 20 mins to find that map &gt;.&lt;), So i won&#39;t be having items (FOR NOW) such as whips etc because i don&#39;t have a slayer area and i dont want to have a lousy &#39;slayer portal&#39; that talks :). 

What i need to do :

Fix magic, currently it doesnt work AT ALL &gt;.&lt;
Range - You have unlimited arrows because it doesnt delete the arrow as you fire it, also need to fix max hit formula i think.
Most skills, because of the base these are pretty easy to the basics for, so i&#39;ll get to these ASAP.
NPC drops, these are created by a unique system - which follows this syntax: NpcID=ItemID,MinAmt-MaxAmt,droprate:droprate (eg 1:2 would be 1 in 2 drops). This means i have a pretty good economy due to the randomness in npc drops.
Make it so you can attack anyone wearing the opposite cape (blue = Fally red = varrock) if they are in their home town, yes they will loose items but i only want it enabled if capes are on IN THE HOME TOWN (Eg Red cape on player fred goes to falador and sees bob with a blue cape on, he can attack him)
Make Barbarian village wildy with no wildy levels at all (Free for all)- Won&#39;t be too bad due to max level.
Correct all npc&#39;s + make them move (Awch :P)
Block off all other areas with either invisible barriers or simply walls- if i do this i&#39;ll add a few npc&#39;s that you can talk to and ask why the gates closed :P

<p>I can offer some great coding skills!</p>
<p>Proof is that I make iPhone and iPod Touch!</p>
<p>So Why Should you choose a kid who you have no idea who it is and has a reputation of 10 and is a junior member?</p>
<p>Well firstly I have great hosting skills and it’s super fast on my 8GB Ram And 250GB  hard-drive on a macbook pro with super fast 20 megabites per second internet. We could have an awesome server going!</p>
<p>I also code mainly in java and C++ but also code Objective-C and Cocoa and Cocoa Touch so I could be a great addition to your growing private server!</p>
<p>Anyways even if you don’t want me to join I wish you great luck in your current projects and any future projects!</p>
<p>Good Luck,</p>
