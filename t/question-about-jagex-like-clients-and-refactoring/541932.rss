    <title>Question about jagex-like clients and refactoring</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-jagex-like-clients-and-refactoring/541932</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m quite new to the rs2 section. I&#39;m attempting to find to find a &#39;Jagex-like&#39; client + server for pre-hd that includes construction. I&#39;ve also noticed that most clients have only been de&#39;obed but not refactored. Is this common or are their clients available that have been refactored?

Thanks!</description>

              <p>Wouldn’t a non-refactored client severely limit your ability to fix problems and add content? For example like adding quests and fixing cooking recipes? I used to do rsclassic work and most of that was client sided from what I remember.</p>

              <p>there are refactoring programs out there that can get the job done, not sure on the credibility of the results however.</p>
<p>most clients are just deobbed and slightly modified to disable rsa and connect to the local servers. not much client modification is needed after that, so that’s why they don’t bother to refactor.</p>
