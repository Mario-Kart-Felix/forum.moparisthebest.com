    <title>Dude whoever made private servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dude-whoever-made-private-servers/19774</link>
    <description>The person who made private servers is a god. An absolute god. I would like to thank them, k3nn1 and nvi_ible2 for making me money. This is a record of my achievements over a period of 2 days in GodScape and MoparScape.org SMF :

Day 1. Made k3nn1 admin for 100k and 196 willows. He is glad he did that. Also, I posted my first two tutorials.

Day 2. NVI_IBLE2 buys admin. Says he will pay me at the end of the month. I don&#39;t believe him.

Day 3. 1.00am Night time GMT : NVI_IBLE2 buys a copy of the source for a Rune Kite (T) in Real RS. This includes his price for admin.

Day 3. 9.30am Morning GMT : I found out I am 250k richer thanks to the person sharing my account.

In these 3 days I have made 375k profit (INCLUDING THE WILLOWS) thanks to the people who created the private servers. God Bless You!</description>
