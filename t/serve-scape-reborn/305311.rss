    <title>Serve-Scape Reborn</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/serve-scape-reborn/305311</link>
    <description>EDIT: I will have pictures by tomorrow :) also I am the only one working on this Dev :)

Well i though since I didn&#39;t have as much HW as i thought i would have. So i am going to start on a server again :)

[code]Little history:
Serve-Scape was made in 2008 and hosted for about a year :P
I had 45+ people on almost all the time.
CZAR based- it lagged at like 50 people :|
just AllStar i didn&#39;t know what i was doing then[/code]

[code]What&#39;s new:
WL based with many updates for stability :) better skills not all chopped up and made with bad processed timers, going to try to add full castle wars and dual arena, better COMBAT needed badly since WL v.3 had only pvnpc magic and basic range and melee.
[/code]
[code]Update List:
TPC Removed with S and L fixed ty ramli.
PVP magic most spells I think 17 are missing for normal and that&#39;s it.
PVP magic muti spells all hit in a 4 square area.
RCing same from WL v.3 but a lot better goes up to 10X now and all portals out work for all alters I know
RangeHandler added but deleted going to re add when I feel like fixing range again
The bytebuffer is now set to a lower number 1m is to high :P
Trade scam fixed now you can&#39;t decline fast or x log to scam people :)
Range arrow fix they now show up as the amount you have and not 190 it was to easy to fix :P
working Defence for PVP and PVNPC I think :S I used a tut :P
Banded users and ip&#39;s can now be banned :)[/code]

[code]Credit&#39;s some people are on different forums:
Me
ramli
Graham
Java&#39;
Mrs. Extorl Limited
Rune-Age maker?
l3br0n20
Exorecheese? some spells and start for PVP magic[/code]

Total time spent working and playing :P:
6H

Pictures:
None Yet :( I have to take a bunch for you guys</description>
