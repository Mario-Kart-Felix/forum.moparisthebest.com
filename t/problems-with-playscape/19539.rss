    <title>Problems with PlayScape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-playscape/19539</link>
    <description>Hey, um... I&#39;m having some serious issues with playscape right now:
Using Cheez 80...

Firstly, when the server is up and running fine, everybody will be kicked randomly. When I look at the server screen, it&#39;ll have normal stuff, then all the sudden:
[code]saving for _____
___ disconnected
saving for _____
___ disconnected
saving for _____
___ disconnected[/code]
(with ___ being actual names)
I&#39;ve tried to find out what is causing this, its not a bug, because what happens before everybody is kicked is different, so its not a command issue or anything.
I get no errors, Please help. Thanks

Second problem:
The auto-saver works fine, but if you are being saved otherwise (being kicked, logging out, etc.) it won&#39;t save your character, it just says:
[code]
Saving for _____
could not save for _____
_____ disconnected[/code]

Third:

The server will randomly freeze after a while, the server window will just stop moving, and stay at one thing (no, no errors) usually just somebody&#39;s auto save, or a command or something.
And everybody will be kicked, but it doesn&#39;t show anything on the window, because it just freezes.

Thanks for helping![br][size=1]Posted at: October 22, 2006, 02:15:21 AM[/size][hr]Anybody?[br][size=1]Posted at: October 22, 2006, 06:31:10 PM[/size][hr]Please?</description>

              <p>Cheez worked fine for me for a long while. And I’m beyond the point of just “switching” sources. I have 60k lines in Client, as well as a bunch of other java files, cfg, and other homemade things.</p>
