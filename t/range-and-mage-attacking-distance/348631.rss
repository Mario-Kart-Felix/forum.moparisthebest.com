    <title>Range and mage attacking distance</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/range-and-mage-attacking-distance/348631</link>
    <description>Like the title says.. Whenever I cast a mage spell or attack with range I run towards the person and stand directly infront of them.. If you need more detail I can try and give it but I think that&#39;s to the point. I&#39;m not asking to be spoon fed although it would be nice. But if not just give me a general spot to search for/look at and I can try and fix it.

So much appreciation - Thanks,
