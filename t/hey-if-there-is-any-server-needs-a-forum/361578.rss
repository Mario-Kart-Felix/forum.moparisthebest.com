    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hey-if-there-is-any-server-needs-a-forum/361578</link>
    <description>hey if there is any server that needs a good forum i just finished coding one with a xat chatbox.
its pretty well codded i think lol :P but um yeh i spend about 2-3 hours a day working on it.
i made a logo for it but it has a white strip around it...(i will be getting it fixed but its not my main cunsern right now).
my main goal right now is to change the pictures for the new posts locked posts stuff like that.
i know how to do it but i cant get a .gif to work in gimp to get a good pic. so i still need to figure that part out.
my next goal is to get the crowns for staff but i havent figured out why the url./html. links arent working they are .gif and thats what it takes.
but there is some other small stuff im still working on i can add or delete/replace or do anything you want.
i will also make you a admin or owner...(the admin is better beacuse thats was what it came with when i got the forum)
i also need to make the donater group.
i can also change the domain when ever i want as many times as i want if u need me to.
but these are some things to know about the forum.
my forum link is rs-server.tk
my email is tapoutxd@aol.com
and you can also get in contact with me by youtube im on it every day checking my stuff just search dontbehatin132 and go to my channel and send me a private message and set up a date and time or just come on the forums register tell me about ur server and let  me see if u really have one and ill make u staff on everything on the forum and thats about it.
