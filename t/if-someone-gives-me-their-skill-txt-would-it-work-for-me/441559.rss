    <title>If someone gives me their skill .txt would it work for me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/if-someone-gives-me-their-skill-txt-would-it-work-for-me/441559</link>
    <description>I was wondering if i take someones fletching/smelting/crafting .txts and paste em on my source, would it work for me? I really need this because my source DC&#39;s you when you ATTEMPT to do any of the above skills. Or can I fix this?</description>

Am I the only one here that’s confused… He’s asking for a text file. Servers use java…<br>

<p>Copy-pasting those skill classes won’t work because the class will have different imports from your server. Just write them yourself; you will learn if you mess with things.</p>

<p>The only thing I can discern from txt files is perhaps some backwards scripting.</p>
