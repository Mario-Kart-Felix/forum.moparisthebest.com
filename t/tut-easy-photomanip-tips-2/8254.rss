    <description>[b][size=14pt]Easy PhotoManip Tips #2![/size][/b]

[b]Welcome[/b]
Welcome to part two of the Easy Photomanip tips: Part Two! Before reading this guide, I reccomend you read and attempt all of the techniques from my last tut, and also read the articles and the beggining of the tut, pertaining to warnings and requirments, ammong other things. You can find it [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,10566.0.html]Here[/url].

[b]Additional Warning[/b]
DO NOT Merge your stock photo with any other layers, or apply and effects dirrectly onto your stock image. The stock image should be preserved in the psd, just incase you lose your orrigonal photo. Also, you can compress the orrigonal, final and psd into a rar or zip or ace, to save space, and to keep it organized.

[b][u]Method 1: Adjusting Curves #2[/u][/b]

[i]Description:[/i] We are going to adjust the curves this time to make a scene look a bit colder, or to look cloudy. This is useful when you want to turn a sunny picture into a cloudy one, or make it look later in the day.

[i]Difficulty:[/i] Easy/Novice

Step one: Open up your stock photo. for this method I am using the same one as my last tut, This one:

(Thanks to [url=http://www.sxc.hu/profile/danssara]danssara[/url] For letting me use it.)

Step two: Go to Layers&gt;New Adjustment Layer&gt;Curves
[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/curves1.jpg[/img]

Step 3: Do virtually the same thing as the last curves, but reverse it. Select the down arrow to chose between red or blue. Move the blue up and the red down.
Red:[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/Curvescold1.jpg[/img] 
Blue:[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/Curvescold.jpg[/img]

[i]Afterthoughts:[/i] And you are done! Mess around with this adjustment, it provides alot of opportinitys, just have an idea of what the feel of your picture is going to be.  :D

[b][u]Method 2: Auto-Contrast[/u][/b]

[i]Description:[/i] This is one of the simplest ways to add some vibrance and feel into a picture. Can be used on almost anything.

[i]Dificulty:[/i] Beginner

Step one: Open stock photo. I am using a picture of water running off of rocks.
[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/580680_11921270.jpg[/img]

Step two: Duplicate your background with the shortcut: Ctrl+J

Step three: Go to Image&gt;Adjustments&gt;Auto Contrast

[b]Final Product:[/b]
Before:

After:
[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/Autocontrastfinal.jpg[/img]

[i]Afterthoughts:[/i] There you go! It doesn&#39;t do much, but it can certainly make a picture slightly more dramatic. You don&#39;t need to duplicate the layer, but I like to do it because it preserves the stock.



[b][u]Method 3: Brushing[/u][/b]

[i]Description:[/i] The brushing method is used to highlight key areas, and gives it a radient lumminecence. It works great for water, or anything elce that you need to add brighter highlights to. Note: This tutorial is more advanced than the others. This adds a nice affect but is a bit harder.

[i]Dificulty:[/i] Intermediate

Step one: Open up your stock. I am using the water and rocks pic from Method 2.
[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/580680_11921270.jpg[/img]

Step two: Create a new layer overtop of the stock. (Ctrl+Shift+N)

Step three: Take out your brush tool. (It can sometimes be hidden under the pencil tool.) Make sure you have the &quot;Basic Brushes&quot; Pack selected, (Default setting), and chose the soft brush, at 30 pixels. (You can make it smaller or larger deppending on what size your canvas is.)
[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/brushed1.jpg[/img]

Step four: Brush over the layers to be highlighted, and don&#39;t worry about how it looks now, it will end up looking better.
[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/brushed2.jpg[/img]

Step five: Set the top layers blending mode to soft light [IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/Brushed3.jpg[/img], and you can see that instantaniously there is a luminecent glow over the brushed areas. If you see some areas that the brush goes off course, use the SOFT (0% hardness) eraser to take some of it out.
[IMG]http://i89.photobucket.com/albums/k212/Daztuts/Easy%20Photomanip%20Tips/Brushed.jpg[/img]

Step six: If the water seems to luminecent, or you don&#39;t want as much of an effect, tone it down a bit by lowering the opacity. Also, for best results, use a gaussian blur in the background. (Find out how from my first tutorial.)

[b]Final Results:[/b]
Before:

After:

Afterthoughts: It&#39;s a huge difference. Remember to experiment! Tinkering with photoshop is the best way to learn. Remember this technique, It gives a great effect.

As you can see, the water seem to have a little bit of accented blue, and the rocks are a much more earthy tone. Thanks for the compliment by the way (++ if ya like ;D)</p>
