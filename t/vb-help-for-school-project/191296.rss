    <description>Were making an amazing tic tac toe game which well be graded. I&#39;ve got everything down except the computer A.I and the looks. I&#39;m trying to have the button change it&#39;s picture appearance when it&#39;s clicked. So far this is what I have:
[code]intRow = (Index \ 3) + 1
intCol = (Index) Mod 3 + 1
If strBoard(intRow, intCol) = &quot;&quot; Then
    If intCounter Mod 2 = 0 Then
        strBoard(intRow, intCol) = &quot;O&quot;
        cmdplay(Index).Caption = &quot;O&quot;
        cmdplay(Index).Enabled = False
        strPlayerTwo = &quot;Player 1&quot;
        lblTurn.Caption = strPlayerTwo
    ElseIf intCounter Mod 2 = 1 Then
       strBoard(intRow, intCol) = &quot;X&quot;
        cmdplay(Index).Picture = LoadPicture(App.Path &amp; &quot;\X.bmp&quot;)
        strPlayerOne = &quot;Player 1&quot;
        cmdplay(Index).Enabled = False
        strPlayerOne = &quot;Player 2&quot;
        lblTurn.Caption = strPlayerOne
        
    End If
End If
[/code]
What happens is when I click the button, the button goes back to gray but I can still a few white lines of the top part of the x, so I know it&#39;s being displayed still. At the buttem of the button it displays the &quot;X&quot;. App.Path is leading to he right directory and as far as I know there aren&#39;t any typos. I&#39;m sure theres a small mistake here but I can&#39;t wrap my head around it. I was going to google the rest but if anyone here knows. How can I make the button shake when I click on it? And can I use animated gifs?</description>
