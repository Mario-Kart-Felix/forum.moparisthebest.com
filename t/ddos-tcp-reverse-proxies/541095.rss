    <description>Prices seem to be dropping for DDoS TCP reverse proxies.

https://ddosdeflect.com/tcp.html

https://www.xznetworks.com/proxy

https://5gbps.com/ddos-protected-vps.php


Hide the database and listening server somewhere, put the website behind cloudflare, host a couple world servers off a few cheap VPS boxes with a tcp reverse proxy, and it looks possible to keep something online. Other than AWS, what other low budget ways could something have as a good defense against the usual server DDoS attacks?</description>

Better analogy would be walking into a theme park (moparscape), someone asks a question about a specific church for some reason, and then you have a pastor from that church stand up on podium and start preaching to everyone whether they cared about the question or not. Person should have just gone and asked a pastor instead.</p>

              <p>I’d like some input from how RSCE has been handling their attacks. I see that they use a game launcher that checks for updated versions of the client jar and shows news information. In their client, they have a location drop down menu with four locations which I suspect are four IPs all pointing to the same game server. I guess that whenever one of these IPs are hit with a DDoS, they let it get null routed for a while and allow players to use one of the other IPs to connect for the time being. Is that how it is working right now?</p>

Seems pretty odd to delete relevant information from a representative from the company.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Advertising isn’t welcome here, so if the post had a strong bias to a particular company then maybe that’s why he removed it.[/quote]This. A company created an account on the forums to advertise (the username was even the company name). If people want to contact their customer service they should use their website, not ours. I banned the advertisers account and moderated the MoparScape user that was causing the arguments. They only even had 1 post that wasn’t part of the flame war, and that was a company specific post. I’ll quote it here with the links removed since it might actually be useful to some people.</p>
<blockquote>[quote] Surely you need to invest in a serious amount of infrastructure to protect against the biggest attacks? Or do you simply respond to attacks by dynamically scaling out using cloud etc?[/quote]
<p>In terms of infrastructure, it is fully dynamic. We encourage customers to use our hostname in their applications so that we can route traffic to other network scrubbing destinations at a DNS network level with no interruption to service.</p>
<p>We have spent a lot of time building our own proprietary infrastructure and a pretty neat code base which allows for customers to purchase and deploy a proxy in 60 seconds or less, as well as update the destination end point IP/port from the client area (with changes being applied in 60 seconds or less, too).</p>
