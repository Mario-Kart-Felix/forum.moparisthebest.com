    <title>Why was there only middle ages in europe</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-was-there-only-middle-ages-in-europe/176021</link>
    <description>Everyone knows that the whole middle ages took place in Europe. No where in, Canada, U.S.A, south america, south africa was there fighting going on with swords and knights and castles.

Atleast no documented ones. Discuss why the other continents remained dorment while battles raged on during these times.

Now, I don&#39;t know much, or anything about this topic but some guy called peter hurley, he does shows and tought kids about the middle ages, I remember when I was 10 and he still does do shows, but I never got around to finding the answer out. Anyways, he either said something about a long time ago (very long time, not 300 years) in iraq something happened and it changed his life forever, or that he found out a long time ago in iraq, most likely first one.</description>

<p>The “New World” was discovered long before Columbus found it.  Perhaps you mean Columbus brought the discovery of the “New World” to Europe.</p>

              <p>Everyone knows that the whole middle ages took place in Europe. No where in, Canada, U.S.A, south america, south africa was there fighting going on with swords and knights and castles.</p>
<p>Atleast no documented ones. Discuss why the other continents remained dorment while battles raged on during these times.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t know much, or anything about this topic but some guy called peter hurley, he does shows and tought kids about the middle ages, I remember when I was 10 and he still does do shows, but I never got around to finding the answer out. Anyways, he either said something about a long time ago (very long time, not 300 years) in iraq something happened and it changed his life forever, or that he found out a long time ago in iraq, most likely first one.</p>
