    <title>Friend can&#39;t connect, and what am I connecting to?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/friend-cant-connect-and-what-am-i-connecting-to/451926</link>
    <description>So to start off, I am running brokenX v1 [pi]. I went into client.java,searched for server= and got these 2

//server = &quot;&quot;; this one had the 127.0.0 one
server = &quot;&quot;; and this one had 0.0.0.0 somthing like that

my ports are checked and open for sure, I have the no-ip on my computer, but my friend cant connect. I just put my no-ip server name in both of these spaces. He couldnt connect, and I could. So when i was trying to troubleshoot it, I removed both spots where my no-ip name should go, and it still connected me. What am I connecting to? it has to be offline, and its really confusing me!!</description>
