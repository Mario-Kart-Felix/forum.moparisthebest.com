<p>[size=20pt]How To Place Npcs[/size]<br>
Go To Your Server Folder and open autospawn.cfg<br>
OR<br>
/cfg/autospawn.cfg</p>
<p>Scroll To The Very Bottom And Add This</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = nnnn	xxxx	yyyy	hhhh	rx1	ry1	rx2	ry2	walkt	desc</code></pre>
<p>Heres The Layout</p>
<p>nnnn == The Npc Id Found Here <a href="http://mushroompkforum.smfforfree3.com/index.php/topic,5.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://mushroompkforum.smfforfree3.com/index.php/topic,5.0.html</a><br>
xxxx == The X coords Of Were The Npc Should Be<br>
yyyy == The y coords of were the npc should be<br>
hhhh == the height of the npc (LEAVE AT 1 UNLESS YOU HAVE MULTIPLE LEVELS ON YOUR SERVER)<br>
rx1 == were the npc should walk to first in x coords<br>
ry1 == were the npc should walk to first in y coords<br>
rx2 == were the npc should walk to 2nd in x coords<br>
ry2 == were the npc should walk to 2nd in y coords<br>
walkt == leave zero if no walking and 1 if the npc walks<br>
desc == just for reference doesnt do anything EG. Owner npc</p>
<p>[size=20pt]How To Make Npcs Talk[/size]<br>
Open <code>npchandler.java</code></p>
<p>Press Ctrl + F<br>
and Search</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">npctype</code></pre>
<p>It Should Come up like this</p>
<p><code>                    if (npcs[i].npcType == NPCID) {
                        if (misc.random2(30) &lt;= 2) {
                            npcs[i].updateRequired = true;
                            npcs[i].textUpdateRequired = true;
                            npcs[i].textUpdate = "THETALKING!";
                     }
                    }</code></p>
<p>its odvious<br>
2 things to change<br>
NPCID is the id of the npc (found here <a href="http://mushroompkforum.smfforfree3.com/index.php/topic,5.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://mushroompkforum.smfforfree3.com/index.php/topic,5.0.html</a>)<br>
THETALKING is what the npc will say above its head</p>
<p>eg.</p>
<p><code>              if (npcs[i].npcType == 81) {
                        if (misc.random2(30) &lt;= 2) {
                            npcs[i].updateRequired = true;
                            npcs[i].textUpdateRequired = true;
                            npcs[i].textUpdate = "moo!";
                     }
                    }</code></p>
