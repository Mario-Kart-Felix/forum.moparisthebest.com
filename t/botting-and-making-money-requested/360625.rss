    <title>Botting and making money :) [Requested]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/botting-and-making-money-requested/360625</link>
    <description>I know there is a thread for this and the reason I&#39;m making this is because if I post something on that thread it will never/ barley be seen. + I&#39;m going to be updating this with money making.

When I get home from school I&#39;ll post some things on here lol ;)</description>

I know you were asked a question in a different thread about how you made your money, in which case you should reply in that thread, or post your method in the ‘money making’ thread and give a link in your give away thread.</p>
