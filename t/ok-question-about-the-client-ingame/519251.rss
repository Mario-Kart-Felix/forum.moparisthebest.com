<p>i know man i annoy myself, but when i do ask for real help then i never recieve it.  When i need real help it seems i get no where here besides people bashing. :<br>

<p>it is because of posts like this. if you look at this help forum you probably notice that around 90% of the topics are your own and some of them arent that complex if you looked through the code a little bit. I say if you spend an hour or two looking for the chat implementations and then still somehow cant find it, then yeah, make a post. but here it looks like you didnt put in any effort[/quote]<br>
90 percent?? are you dumb? lol im on the first page of like 100. plus for others wondering these things they can learn them from here… and also maybe all this can spark some more interest in RSC community go get people to want to learn and learn</p>

              <p>You need to get more familiar with the source, start looking through every single file in the server and see what it does. I mean if it had to do something with the Chat in game, maybe there is a ‘ChatHandler’, or 'Chat", or something similar.</p>
