    <title>So MITB.com is screwed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-mitb-com-is-screwed/158489</link>
    <description>Current staff round-up:
Moparisthebest - Active
Waffendennis - MIA &lt; I&#39;m not MIA. I&#39;m here everyday and I post too, yes not all posts are visible for everyone since they are behind the scene, but I&#39;m here :).
Starblaster - MIA
Bobdole81 - Posting every few weeks.

The Un-named - Posting every few days.
Freddy1990 - Posting every few weeks.
Pwnd - Active; ~5 posts a day.
Kmb - MIA (No posts in 3 weeks).
Krichevskoy - MIA (No posts in 2 months).
Ron - Posting every few days.
therealjdb - Active; though not nearly as active as he was.
Lothy - Posting every few days.

So we really only have three active staff who post (Fastbawlz pointed out that many of these mods/admins post in the mod sections, as well as performing staff duties... but they don&#39;t contribute to active discussion on the main board, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m basing it on).  And the intelligent people on the forum are all but gone.  Yzracer, davidude, and the third biggest spammer, Exe, is also gone, and as the fourth biggest spammer, nothing on these forums really interest me anymore (really just the WDOTM, if that).  Stupid drivel fills this forum.  Shit like this:

http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,215945.msg1881997.html#msg1881997
http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,215806.0.html
http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,215834.msg1881255.html#msg1881255
http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,211746.0.html
http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,212306.msg1855640.html#msg1855640

I think it&#39;s because the only source of new members we have is moparisthebest.com.  And as you know, they really aren&#39;t all that brilliant.  The stupidity in the forums and lack of activity is really causing more and more people to drop out, further increasing the degradation of the community.  People who are willing to learn a programming language to macro aren&#39;t coming here anymore... they&#39;re going to SRL Forums.  Too bad their servers are slow and they don&#39;t use SMF.  And anyway, it&#39;s filled with pubescent kiddies like solarwind.

I seriously think mopargenius, Monkey wacko, Swordskid61, sidishere, and a bunch of other retards should be banned right now.  But I know it&#39;s not going to happen unless they do something completely retarded.  I&#39;m looking at sidishere&#39;s posts right now, and they&#39;re the stupidest garbage crap I&#39;ve ever read.  Not to single you out, sid, you&#39;re just the only guy I bothered to look at.

Fastbawlz and I thought about starting an invite only forum, where you need to have some intelligence to join, so it won&#39;t be filled with mindless bullshit... but I&#39;m too lazy to put effort into it.</description>

Technically speaking; he did post the idea before you therefore he is entitled to the claim of that idea. As you know plagarism inculdes the part of using another person’s idea. Although you didn’t plagarize you did post afterwords therefore making your post as equal to plagariziam as the idea had already been posted by him. In layman terms, If i make a cell phone  now and call it my invention it wouldn’t matter because I didn’t do it first even If i hadn’t even heard of a cell phone before inventing it. Get the point?<br>

<p>as you can see, i posted the idea and its layout and then other people commented.</p>
<p>plagiarism [play‐jă‐rizm], the theft of ideas (such as the plots of narrative or dramatic works) or of written passages or works, where these are passed off as one’s own work without acknowledgement of their true origin; or a piece of writing thus stolen.</p>

<p>All right, dipshit.  Here we go.</p>
<p>First of all, I actually checked their posting dates and times, when they were last active, and whether they were active in mod forums.  You on the other hand, just played it by ear.</p>
<p>Second, I had not seen your post, and it’s fairly clear by the fact that I didn’t even post in that thread that I did not read it.</p>
<p>Third, I am fully aware of what plagiarism is and what it entails.  I don’t plagiarize.  Get over it.</p>
