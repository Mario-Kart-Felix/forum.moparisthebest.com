    <title>A quick question. Appreciated if awnsered!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-quick-question-appreciated-if-awnsered/228525</link>
    <description>I am testing out a newly coded server with my brother. I logged in privately (put No ip in the ip box) and I was able to log in with 2 different clients and I was able to interact with my other account running on another client. Is there a way I can connect to the server from my computer in the same way I did on the one running the server? This is so we can test all the updates we did on it and hopefully release it..[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 28, 2008, 04:30:32 pm[/size][hr]BUMP. ;)</description>
