    <title>King Arthur Revenge. Looking for co developers!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/king-arthur-revenge-looking-for-co-developers/418649</link>
    <description>Hello. King Arthurs Revenge. You may be wondering to yourself &quot;What is this&quot; Well, thats not a simple question. This game will be built on the grounds of customization. There will be a multiplayer and a singleplayer part. We will have servers, all that stuff. Thats not the point, the point is. I need experienced people in either c++ or java. I am trying to decide between the two programming languages, but I have not made my mind up yet. You must know OOP and work pretty professionally to join. We will eventually make a profit off of this game, however, at that point and time we will all split the profit, etc. If you want to apply, then here is what we need.

Graphics Developer: What makes you different from the normal people?
                           Previous work?
                           Experience?
                           Reason for applying?
By the way, by graphics i mean models, etc.

Developer: Years in programming language and programming language (C++, Java)?
                Reason for joining?
               time zone, time available, and dedication.
Eventually i will post other stuff in here when we need them. Thank you for loooking at my thread.</description>
