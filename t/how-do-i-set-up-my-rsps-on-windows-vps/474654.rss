    <title>How do I set up my RSPS on Windows VPS?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-set-up-my-rsps-on-windows-vps/474654</link>
    <description>Hey there. I think I got the main concept like transfering the source to vps. But what ip do I put into source? Cause atm I am hostin my my comp and using no-ip. For vps I assume you have to use the vps ip. So do I just put that into my source and run off of that? Help would be appreciated. Thanks</description>
