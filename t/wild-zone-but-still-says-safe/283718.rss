    <title>Wild Zone but still says Safe</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wild-zone-but-still-says-safe/283718</link>
    <description>I had some weird glitch on my server, it says &#39;Safe&#39; Even when you are in the wild, and I honestly do not know what happened... I Deleted all of my safe zone&#39;s, and it still said safe, so I put them back and went into the Wild and it said Safe, I made sure that my &#39;Y&#39; Cords were under 3520 But, even in my Funpk it says Safe, but when you attack someone it reacts as if it was still Funpk. I have gone threw and were it says Wild for the Wild Zone, I have made sure it was still there and it is. Now, I am not the greatest coder but is there any way I can create a wild zone, and if so what would I search in my Client?</description>

Something like that, but don’t use that. It won’t work.</p>
