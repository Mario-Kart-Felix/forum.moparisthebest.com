    <title>Need Help 9th grade math</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-9th-grade-math/149870</link>
    <description>I need help with this question so if you would tell me the answers and how to do them so I understand.
 
1. What is the largest possible value of [i]x[/i] given that [i]x[/i]^3=5x? Express your answers in simplest radical form? :confused:

2. In a triangle with three distinct angle measures, the smallest angle measures 30 degrees. The measures of the other two interior angles are each a whole number of degrees. What is the measure of the largest possible angle in the triangle? :confused:

3. What is the value of x such that (x,0) is a solution of the equation y=3[i]x[/i]-4? Express your answers as a common fraction

4. A roll of carpet is 15 feet wide. The carpet costs $20 per square yard. A customer must purchase the carpet in a piece that is 15 feet in width, but the carpet can be cut to any length. Beth wants to use exactly one piece of carpet to cover a floor that is trapezoidal in shape like this [img]http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/8281/10072007124453rg7.jpg[/img], rather than putting multiple pieces together. However, she must also pay for any wasted carpet. What is the cost of the shortest length of the carpet that she can use?

5. The exterior dimensions of the empty cooler in the shape of a rectangular prism are 18 inches by 18 inches by 24 inches. For insulation, the top bottom, and each of the four walls are two inches thick. What is the volume of the empty space inside the cooler?

Really would appreciate any time of help. Thanks</description>
