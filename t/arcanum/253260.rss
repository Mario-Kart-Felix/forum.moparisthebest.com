    <description>Since everyone seems to dislike the way this community is managed, a few respected individuals have come together to create something which we hope will present a solution. We are fully aware that most new communities fail, though this one has a few differences.


[ul][li]There are no strict rules. It&#39;s a community.[/li]
[li]Large scale plans to change the entire scene in one way or another. [/li]
[li]It&#39;s a place that isn&#39;t centered around Runescape. In fact, we only have one section dedicated to it. Due to the amount of interest in AoE, we have allowed a forum for that.[/li]
[li]A place that arguments and differences are encouraged. Unlike other places, we understand that this is capable of causing progression. [/li][/ul]


Basically, sppt and i are hoping to create something a little different. Give it some time and effort and hopefully we will be able to start a fully working community.

              <blockquote>Welcome to Arcanum. Thanks goes to Ollie for the hosting and use of his domain name. [b]Our main priority is to get the member count up to as high as possible by mid January.[/b] After this, we will consider making this an invite only community. In regards to the banner, this will be fixed once somebody decides to create us a bit of GFX.
<p>I’m not going to bother posting a set amount of rules. We really only have a problem with spamming and advertising. If flaming or arguments get too out of hand, we will move the topic or post to the Debates/Arguments forum. I enjoy watching two idiots fight for absolutely no reason as much as the next person.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">We will be using <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> as our IRC channel. I see no use in dividing a community that’s already horribly split.</span></p>

I bolded the portions that I personally found amusing.  ;D
<p>I have no problems with site advertisement, but I expect you guys, like everyone else, to limit advertisement to your signatures.</p>
