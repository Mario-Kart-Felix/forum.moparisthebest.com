    <title>[GUI] What is the error, with my GUI?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gui-what-is-the-error-with-my-gui/389663</link>
    <description>Here is the error in the compiler:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Looking for JDK
Compiling scripts
Scripts\Sources\AutoHerbloreProTOS.java:27: cannot find symbol
symbol  : class AutoHerbloreLoader
location: class AutoHerbloreProTOS
        AutoHerbloreLoader GUI;
        ^
Scripts\Sources\AutoHerbloreProTOS.java:259: cannot find symbol
symbol  : class AutoHerbloreLoader
location: class AutoHerbloreProTOS
                GUI = new AutoHerbloreLoader();
                          ^
Note: Some input files use or override a deprecated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.
2 errors
Press any key to continue . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I don&#39;t quite understand what is going on. A little background on what this is, it&#39;s a script handler (much like that of PowerBot), for my server. For every skill, there is a starting script one to display the TOS (needs to be changed, to Information) that displays a paragraph so the player can understand the skill. Next, a GUI will be booted up, that basically helps the player with the skill (a guide, if you must). Anyways, I cannot seem to find the issue here. 

If it&#39;s obvious, and I&#39;m just to much of an idiot to see it, rather than &quot;flaming&quot; the topic, simply tell me how I could have missed it.

Thanks.  :cool:</description>

              <p>[quote=“I Vain I”]Is this even server sided?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/error">@Error</a>; you’re calling the class ‘AutoHerbloreLoader’ but using the class ‘AutoHerbloreProTOS’</p>
<p>How can you not understand that? :S[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s a GUI loading within a class.</p>
