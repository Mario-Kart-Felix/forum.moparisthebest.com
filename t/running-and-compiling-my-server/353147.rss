    <title>Running and compiling my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/running-and-compiling-my-server/353147</link>
    <description>Hello there.

Ive been trying to set up my own private server for a couple of days now but atm im sadly failing at it. Ive had my own server up and running before but ever since ive got a new computer i am unable to do it again. I have a few things I would like to ask and hopefully i will get answered.

Firstly. I have windows 7. Do i need to run the compilers and &quot;runserver&quot; as an administrator or can i open it normally?

Secondly, usually when i go to compile something it always comes up saying something like &quot;Recompile with Xlint:deprecation for details.&quot; how can i fix this?</description>

              <p>You can run the compiler and run batch normally, but you can run them as an administrator also. The compiling note: you get is nothing to worry about. As long as you don’t get an error then you compiled correctly with no errors in the source.</p>
