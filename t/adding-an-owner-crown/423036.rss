    <title>Adding an owner crown?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-an-owner-crown/423036</link>
    <description>Ok, so for the server I&#39;m coding [Based off of DeltaScape] I would like to add an Owner Crown specific to Player Rights 3. I know it&#39;s something to do with Client.Java [Client Sided] and Class20_Sub2_Sub1_Sub1 but I&#39;m not sure what else. I have the sprite already in the client &#39;sprites&#39; folder but it doesn&#39;t load at the moment. How do I go about doing this?</description>
