    <title>Icons for MITB Android app</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/icons-for-mitb-android-app/381128</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve started work on an app for these forums since I&#39;d like to browse them occasionally when I&#39;m not near my computer.
I am terrible with photoshop or any those types of programs, so we&#39;d have shit icons if I was doing it.
Anyone up to the challenge?

Here&#39;s Google&#39;s guidelines for making icons for Android: http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design.html

The most important currently is the launcher icon. Menu icons can be worried about later as the layout might change once I&#39;m done, but if you&#39;re willing to make a few go right a head.

Looking for:

[ul][li]Launcher Icon[/li]
[li]Tab icons (&#39;latest&#39;, &#39;browse&#39; and &#39;more&#39; for now)[/li]
[li]Profile, private messages[/li][/ul]


You can make them look how ever you wish, I have no preferences.
And any other you can think of feel free to post so I can to the list.</description>
