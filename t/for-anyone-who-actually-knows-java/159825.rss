    <description>Hai everyone long time no see =]

anyway, to the point.


Mopar Servers are coded in Java. Then theoretically, couldn&#39;t we also code them in a simpler way, that doesn&#39;t require as much space, time, and it also is made from Java?

For instance &quot;Scala&quot;

It&#39;s a programming language. There is not much difference between it, and Java. This is what it looks like.
Here is the canonical Hello world program written in Scala:

[code]object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]) =
    Console.println(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
}[/code]


Notice how similar it is to the stand-alone Hello World application for Java. The notable difference is that we do not declare anything to be static or void; the object keyword gives us a singleton object, freeing us from having to invoke any such constructs.

Then again, theoretically, could we not, rewrite all the mopar servers with Scala, and with our own customizable things?

I&#39;m not saying it would be easy, it would be extremely hard, even our mopar servers aren&#39;t self coded. We got the cache from RuneScape.

Again, I&#39;m not saying we should do it, but if one wanted to, would it be possible?</description>
