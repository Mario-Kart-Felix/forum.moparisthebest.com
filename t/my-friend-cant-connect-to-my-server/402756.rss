    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-friend-cant-connect-to-my-server/402756</link>
    <description>i have done all the portfoward.. and i &#39;think&#39; i did them right, i can log into the server with 0.0.0.0 but my friend couldnt log in with the ip nor the 0.0.0.0 . i have changed the client.java, egui.java complied,Builded but others still could connect to my server.

My first time making server, never had people connect into them. so im not even sure if its me done it wrong or something is wrong with it. help :D..</description>

              <p>ok first of all you have to have a no-ip account and have it set up correctly once that is done you must download there duc 30 client and run it and enable the no-ip host name that you picked once you have done that you must have all of your 43594 ports open. Once you’ve done this you must open the ports on your computer if your using vista go into fire wall and then find allow programs through windows firewall. After you find that you click on add port you add the ports like this</p>
<p>(servernamehere).no-ip.biz<br>
port: 43594<br>
(option) tcp</p>
<p>Then add another port</p>
<p>(servernamehere).no-ip.biz<br>
port: 43594<br>
(option) dcp</p>
<p>Now if you have  windows xp or windows 7 or anyother operating system other then linux and mac you go into advanced fire wall options and you add the ports like above.</p>
<p>Ok now since everything is added now you must run no-ip’s duc 30 then run the server. Once that is done you can check if its online. Now it should be online if not repeat the steps above. Ok now you must change the ip adress on the client you want people to sign into your server with. Ok so now the server ip adress should be (servernamehere).no-ip.biz</p>
<p>Ok now if you did this right you should not need to repeat anything and your server should be online. Also you don’t need hamatchi! woot lol. Ooooooooook now every one should connect but you and that means you have to make another copy of the client for your self and you make the server ip adress on that one to either “0.0.0.0”, “127.0.0.1”, or “localhost”<br>
this should be a fix.</p>
