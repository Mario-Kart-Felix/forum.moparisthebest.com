    <title>How to Play runescape at school (tested)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-play-runescape-at-school-tested/68294</link>
    <description>My school has a very very very annoying internet blocker, and i tried to get into rs (as if)
But, untill two days ago i found out that the runescape web client dident go through the internet explorer as a address link. so the blocker didn&#39;t pick it up, allowing me to do anything on rs from school.

So heres what to do.
1) You will be needing a USB key 
2) the web client witch you can get from here [url=http://www.runescape.com/files/files.ws]http://www.runescape.com/files/files.ws[/url]
And then selecting the windows client
3) a school computer in witch the teachers cannot see without looking directly

ok, Copy (or cut) the windows client to the usb key (from home)
then take it to school and plug into the computer.
Note : DO NOT COPY ONTO THE COMPUTER FROM THE KEY BECAUSE THEN ITS LOGGED AND THEIR FOR CONSIDERED HARMFUL TO THE COMPUTER AND THE NETWORK ADMIN WILL FIND YOU.
Its better to just run it from the usb key for two really good reasions
1, a history wont get logged
2, you can just remove the usb key and it will close the client.
Thats pretty much it.</description>
