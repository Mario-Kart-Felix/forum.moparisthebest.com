    <description>I don&#39;t really know how to start this off, so I&#39;ll just talk about my current situation. There are a couple girls I&#39;m interested in, but they are both sophomores in high school (Grade 10) and I&#39;m a senior (Grade 12). I&#39;ve been getting teased a bit for liking jailbait or being a pedophile, but that got me thinking because I don&#39;t go after girls based on looks.

So what&#39;s the big deal? Sure, if we were still in a relationship when I graduated things would be difficult, but I&#39;m talking just short-term. It is only two years, and that&#39;s two school years. What do you guys think? One of the girls is actually more mature than I am and most people I know, so it just doesn&#39;t make much sense to me.

<p>Here in Florida theres a close-in-age exemption:<br>
Unlawful sexual activity with certain minors.-- (1) A person 24 years of age or older who engages in sexual activity with a person 16 or 17 years of age commits a felony of the second degree, punishable</p>
<p>Its not my priority either, but the law basically blurs the line between the 16-18 gap to make it more manageable.</p>

No issue there if you actually approach it correctly.</p>
<p>Im 18 and talking to a 15 year old who is turning 16 soon, but I only look like a 16 year old and turned 18 a month ago.  As long as the maturity level is tolerable there is no huge issue.</p>

<p>Age gaps only exist as an issue for certain regions. Let’s say we have someone who is 12 and 15. There is a large level of maturity to jump from in that area, therefor a relationship at that age level would not be the best for either party.

<p>For your scenario, I find it slightly weird but not horrible. Dating one grade out of yours is typically fine, but two depends on what we’re talking about. If you’re like 18 and she’s 16, that could all just come down to the level of maturity that exists in her. If it’s 17 and 15, that’s generally fine. If I were you, I’d just go for it. Fuck what others think. Fuck what I just wrote. You’re in highschool, do what you want. Non of this will matter in a few years time anyway.[/quote]<br>
A lot of nice facts here, even at a 2yr difference, it also depends on the maturity of both of them, some people are more ahead of their age than others.</p>

<p>USA. We are in a school of only around 250 kids in a city of around 2.2k. Our school is full of assholes, and they would probably give you shit for it, but it’s not really that. I don’t know her opinions on it, or my parents, etc. I’m 17. She is probably 14 or 15.</p>
