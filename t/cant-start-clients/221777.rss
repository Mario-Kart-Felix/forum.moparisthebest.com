    <title>Can&#39;t Start Clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-start-clients/221777</link>
    <description>Ok, well this may sound really dumb, but I am unable to start the client.  I&#39;m 100% sure that my paths are right, I have this problem with all clients.  I have the newest version of Java and JDK.  I am running on Windows Vista.

Ok, so here&#39;s what happens.

For some reason my computer does not recognize .bat files as running with the command prompt.  So, when I double click the run.bat file, it asks me what I would like to open the file with.

When I choose the command prompt, a blank command prompt just pops up and nothing is executed.

So, in order to run the .bat file, I open the command prompt and type in the exact location of the run.bat, but all I get is &quot;The system cannot find the path specified.&quot;

So, any help on this situation would be greatly appreciated.  I posted the pictures because whenever I would ask about this, I would just get the response: &quot;Are you sure you did this part right?&quot;

Again, sorry if this is a stupid question and I&#39;m just an idiot.

I get this problem for every client I run.

Thanks in advance,
