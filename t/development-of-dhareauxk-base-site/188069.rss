    <title>Development of DHAReauxK Base/Site</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/development-of-dhareauxk-base-site/188069</link>
    <description>Ok well... I just bought a new domain. Yup, super cool  :|

Anyway, I want to start a new development team. I have 2 yrs java experience, and a year in web design.

Im mainly looking for a client coder(s) (renamed client only!) who can add models, perfect items, knows more than alot of people about a client and its setup. You must understand just about everything that can be done to a &quot;377&quot; client (317 with 377 cache).

There is also going to have to be a way for users to communicate on the website so... SMF is the way to go. The main reason I chose SMF is because its free and there has only been 1 flaw in 2 years with them! Therefore, I will need PHP coders and web developers.

As for server developers; I dont really need anybody right now. Anyway to those who dont know me, Im DHAReauxK.

Graphic designers a huge help as well... I cant do graphics and even if I could there wouldnt be enough time. So, I need some gfx ppl too!

As for the server itself, all skills are working at AT LEAST 10% Every single skill is handled except for slayer (base of it). I have even started FarmingSkill.java in the skill package. Combat is %100 perfect! NPC facing, etc, PVP is flawless as well. There is a debug setting and a setup that logs pretty much every error that occurs. It is currently in the alpha beta and will be public as soon as the site is up and the server is SQL-integrated.

Add my MSN to apply &amp; post here. level_7_elite@hotmail.com (public MSN name)  :P

Thats about it there... Dont apply unless youve been in RSPS for 1 1/2 years or more please...</description>
