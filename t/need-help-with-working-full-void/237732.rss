    <description>Yes I really need help with this, i can&#39;t find it anywhere else for help.
Here is what i tried:
Here is the equiped
[code]    public boolean FullVoidrangeEquipped() {
        if (playerEquipment[playerHat] == 15310
		&amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerChest] == 13591
		&amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerLegs] == 13592
		&amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerHands] == 13594) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;			

    }
[/code]

Here is the effect
[code]if (FullVoidrangeEquipped()) {
MaxHit += 50 + misc.random(50);
stillgfx(582, EnemyY, EnemyX);
}
}
[/code]

Didn&#39;t work for range.
Used the same way, and it worked for melee(i think it is because it means melee hit on the effect)
Anyways, I can&#39;t seem how to make this out, if you can help at all with link a link, or actual code it will be greatly appreciated.

Also the base I am using was a hiyascape, then made into silab garza, then mine if taht helps.</description>

              <p>Ok I tried it, didn’t work like i thought so.<br>
Thank you anyways.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 20, 2008, 05:08:53 pm[/size][hr]I thought of useing this:</p>
<p>[code]public void voidrange() {<br>
if(misc.random(30) == 1 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerHat] == 15311<br>
&amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerChest] == 13591<br>
&amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerLegs] == 13592<br>
&amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerHands] == 13594<br>
&amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 15156)<br>
{<br>
hitDiff = 30 + misc.random(5);;<br>
PlayerHandler.players[AttackingOn].currentHealth -= hitDiff;<br>
PlayerHandler.players[AttackingOn].updateRequired = true;<br>
PlayerHandler.players[AttackingOn].hitUpdateRequired = true;<br>
}<br>
public void overvoidrange() {<br>
if(playerLevel[4] &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerHat] == 15310<br>
&amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerChest] == 13591<br>
&amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerLegs] == 13592<br>
&amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerHands] == 13594<br>
&amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 15156)<br>
{<br>
playerLevel[4] = 1;<br>
updateRequired = true;<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>Then this added to teh correct spot:</p>
<p><code>if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (15156)) // Dark Bow
{
PkingDelay = 8;
wepdelay = 8;
voidrange();
overvoidrange();
}</code></p>

will work. The only problem is, is may raise your range permanently by 15 every time you attack. Try it.</p>

              <p>[quote=“slomifier, post:2, topic:237732”]i know this doesn’t answer your question, but isn’t adding a possible 100 to someone’s max hit kinda excessive?</p>
<p>If your using a wL server source, i don’t think max hit is taken into account for range</p>
<p>try:</p>
<p><code>if (FullVoidrangeEquipped()) {
MaxHit += 50 + misc.random(50);
RangeLevel += 15;
stillgfx(582, EnemyY, EnemyX);
}
}</code></p>
<p>I know whatever handles the levels isn’t formatted like that, but it’s just an example.[/quote]</p>
<p>See the <code>MaxHit += 50 + misc.random(50);</code> means that it hits a garenteed 50 with a random number picked out of another 50 plur whatever max hit is (which max hit is always never greater then 10 because range doesn’t work proporly).</p>
<p>So for example, it would take the initial 50 and the max hit lets say it hit a 6, plus a random number 0-50. Lets choose 29.<br>
That would mean that they did a total of 85 which is common in my server because I have the max health at 200.</p>
<p>[quote=“primadude, post:4, topic:237732”]<code>	if (FullVoidrangeEquipped()) {
		MaxHit += misc.random(50);
		stillgfx(582, EnemyY, EnemyX);
	}</code>[/quote]</p>
<p>And this doesn’t really solve the problem because it is exactly what I used but with out the garenteed 50.</p>
<p>See, this code only works for melee, but not range for some reason, and I need an alternative way to make it work.</p>
