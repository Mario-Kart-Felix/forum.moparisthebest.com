    <title>Nvm solved: windows xp setup error 0x0000007b</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nvm-solved-windows-xp-setup-error-0x0000007b/415999</link>
    <description>Solution: I googled for problems installing xp on toshiba laptops(I would guess it would be the same problem with any bios that has the same setting that was causing the error). I solved my problem was the installer couldnt find my hard drive or something like that. i have to go into bios and set the SATA setting from AHCI to compatibility, and that fixed it.

Solved question: ok i am trying to dual boot ubuntu and win xp pro, i have done this b4 without any trouble, but this time im getting a 0x0000007b error.... it pisses me off. i wiped the entire drive, tried to install xp first but got this error, so i installed ubuntu so i could use my computer, i still cant install, i get the same error. Ik its not my installation media, b/c i used it to install a xp on a vm.</description>
