    <title>Stupid noob on runescape forums</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stupid-noob-on-runescape-forums/133665</link>
    <description>I have something to say to jagex that may seem Ridiculous, but I plan on buying runescape to make it the way players want it! I will buy it for an impressive amount someday! The things I would do to runescape are listed below.

1)Bring Runescape Classic back
2)Add more security to runescape 2
3)Build new worlds
4)Make a world with less rules
5)KEEP YOU THERE!
6)Way More than that

If you read #5, that means keep all you there and under my company: Tealy. Please do not delete my thread, I will upgrade runescape to the MAX and beyond! I will make it so it can be better, safer and more fun for everyone!
