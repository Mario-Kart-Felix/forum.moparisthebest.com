    <description>hey guys recently i had a player come on my server and since then, a &quot;hacker&quot; has been stealing accounts and dropping items, and banning people. I have noticed the same time this started happening a new player joined. This player has acted like he knows everything about this &quot;hacker&quot; and says he ddosed him every time i get on to see this &quot;hacker.&quot; He recently also sent me this file that is going to &quot;protect the server from being hacked&quot; and wanted me to import it into my source. Going by experience i did not and was wondering if anyone could let me know what this would do if imported into a 667/718 private server cache. Thanks for your guys help and also let me know what you guys think about this whole problem.

[u]this is the code[/u]
&lt;blockquote&gt;// for trevor - isolated decompiler for all ddos and hacking software.

package jaclib.peer;

public class ddos @ ip 127.0.0.1 extends Peer(runtime java,  act_as 996)
{
    protected IUnknown(jaa var_jaa) {
	try {
	    reference = new loading 718 - 667 originalReference(this, var_jaa);
	} catch (RuntimeException runtimeexception) {
	    throw runtimeexception;
	}
    }
    
    public final long b(int i) = with -- ACCESS DENIED {
	long l;
	try  ifplayer = 127.0.0.1 logout exception,  playername - cryptic {
	+alter 3=runserver jdk unit.java
	    if (i &lt; 22)
		return -83L;
	    l = super.a();
	} catch (RuntimeException runtimeexception) {
	    throw runtimeexception;
	}
	return l;
    }
    
    public final native long AddRef();

	-END-
}

// this should work, had to make it from scratch so might be 1 or 2 errors.

// put this below your run server or whatever you use to start your server.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

              <p>lol this is funny…but think what runescape does…you can’t just stop a “hacker” because they can basically do what ever they want…all you can do is hope that your community fines this “hackers” in game user name and just IP ban him…but that won’t work because you can use a ip hider, so you would have to create it where the ip ban looks through the hiden ip address for the real ip, yet its not that hard to go buy a new router or something for just a fraction of the cost and go do it agian, so anyone i’m just saying your “F.”  Also its not hard to go create a new account after you get a new IP address.  Theres nothing you really can do about this problem.  All runescape does is have account recover, ban the user(not sure about ip ban), yet if you get hack they don’t help you out in game…,so yea good luck</p>
