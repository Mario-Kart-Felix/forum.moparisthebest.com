    <title>&quot;Can&#39;t Load/Download (said) Cache&quot; 317 Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-load-download-said-cache-317-server/540188</link>
    <description>Okay soo I have my webclient up for my server &#39;FlippScape&#39;, and everything else set up for my server to run just fine, but, whenever someone tries to load the client, it sends the message &quot;Error: Can&#39;t Load/Download FlippScapeCache&quot; Even if they have the Cache already in their C:\ Drive extracted and all..

Yes, I have changed the Cache name, and i&#39;m sure that&#39;s where the problem begins. 

*If anyone can point me to the files in the cache where I can change the Downloading and Extracting?*

I have the download link in the CacheDownloader file, but is there something else I need to change for the file to load or Extract right?

&lt;blockquote&gt;public class CacheDownloader {

	private client client;

	private final int BUFFER = 1024;
	
	private final int VERSION = 5;
	private String cacheLink = &quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/rmaguum1g7y4v1n/FlippScapeCache.zip&quot;;
	
	private String fileToExtract = getCacheDir() + getArchivedName();

	public CacheDownloader(client client) {
		this.client = client;
	}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

** I HAVE CHANGED WHAT CACHE THE CLIENT LOADS AS WELL **</description>
