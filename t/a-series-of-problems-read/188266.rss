    <description>[u][b]Problem Number 1:[/b][/u]

I cant find a good compiler.

[u][b]Problem Number 2:[/b][/u]

The Starting place of my server is fucked, and I&#39;ve tried everything i know of to fix it, still isnt fixed.

[u][b]Problem Number 3:[/b][/u]

Since im a beginner coder, and my server source is very uniquely coded, Im hiring experienced coders to work on my server so i dont fuck it up by doing something stupid.

[u][b]Problem Number 4:[/b][/u]

This is my first server, and when i try to fill in my server info and stuff on www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php, it tells me that i can only register one server, when i have never registered one before.

[u][b]Problem Number 5:[/b][/u]

I cant seem to figure out how to change the frame color of my client, or the loading color, like when the bar is filling up its green, and i want it red.
[u]Solutions:[/u]

1. Someone please provide a link or the code for a good compiler. I have already tried mod taharok&#39;s 1.9 and it is shit, sorry to say. And i have tried lots of others, but if anyone knows of a good one please post it here.

2.I&#39;ve gone through every tutorial on changing the starting place, and when a new character logs in, its still in the same place. If anyone has any imput on that, please post it here.

3.The coders will be given super moderator on forums, and admin on the server. If any inappropriate behavior is exhibited, you will be fired. I am in need of at least 2.

4. Im not sure the problem with this, im just going to have to add the server status from a different computer ip.

5. Someone tell me what file to edit to change it.
Any questions ill be glad to answer. 
Please dont flame, or spam, or call me any names, because everyone was a beginner sometime.
