    <title>Changing attack speed and ranging doesn&#39;t work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-attack-speed-and-ranging-doesnt-work/68623</link>
    <description>Hey all, why is my attack speed so slow???It attacks like the normal runescape speed and it sucks balls! 

How do i change that?

Also, whenever i try to kill something with a bow, it says no arrows left in quiver or keeps hitting 0&#39;s...So i get arrows and it says the same thing, and i&#39;m still hitting 0&#39;s!!!!

HELP!!!

lol any help would be good.

Cheers!</description>
