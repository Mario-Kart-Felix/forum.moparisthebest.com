    <title>Far casting (still looking for help)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/far-casting-still-looking-for-help/522470</link>
    <description>basically when i cast with normal magics it stands still, which i wanted, but when i use ancients after every cast i run forward, ive searched all over the net and i couldnt find anything on it.
would someone be able to help me out?

i was reading a guide which didnt work.
but apparently there could be a deadlock or something?
could someone please help me out here?
thank you

EDIT; its the same with range runs in after you fire a shot.</description>
