The parts where you see that say &quot;client rejected (then the ip)&quot; that is to block nulls which is from this tut right here: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,322520.0.html Before I even added that tut to my server though I would ALWAYS get this problem. I AM NOT switching sources because I have done soooo much stuff on this source. Can somebody PLEASE help me and tell me what the problem is because I honestly have no clue. It&#39;s really annoying too because in that tut its made so if you log on with 4 accounts from the same IP it will automatically IP-ban you. I like it like that though and I don&#39;t want to remove that but how do I fix this &quot;already online&quot; glitch?</description>

<p>The parts where you see that say “client rejected (then the ip)” that is to block nulls which is from this tut right here: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,322520.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,322520.0.html</a> Before I even added that tut to my server though I would ALWAYS get this problem. I AM NOT switching sources because I have done soooo much stuff on this source. Can somebody PLEASE help me and tell me what the problem is because I honestly have no clue. It’s really annoying too because in that tut its made so if you log on with 4 accounts from the same IP it will automatically IP-ban you. I like it like that though and I don’t want to remove that but how do I fix this “already online” glitch?</p>
