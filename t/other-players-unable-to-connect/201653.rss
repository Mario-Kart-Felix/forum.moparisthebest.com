    <title>Other players, unable to connect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/other-players-unable-to-connect/201653</link>
    <description>Ok, so I have been running a server for about a month/month and a half maybe, it all works fine, players can connect to it and play and whatnot. One day, I get new internet security, and I have to uninstall McAfee to put it on. So I uninstall mcafee and winamp. I install Kaspersky Internet Security, and all the sudden no one can connect to my server. I wonder if it&#39;s Kaspersky firewall or what, but nothing notifies me when i open up the runserver so I don&#39;t think thats it. I have the latest java updates for jre and jdk.. I&#39;m out of ideas, can anyone suggest anything?

P.S: A new source will not work, already tried it.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 21, 2008, 03:20:05 PM[/size][hr]Anyone? Anyone at all?</description>
