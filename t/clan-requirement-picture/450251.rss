    <description>I don&#39;t really know what to name the title, but this is what I need.
It doesn&#39;t have to be all fancy, I just want a background that goes good with the text. Nothing major.
Ignore the Super Swag, it&#39;s part of the site lol.

This is what I want it to say:

[center][size=22pt]SS Skillers[/size]
(Super Swag Skillers)

[b]Requirements:[/b]
Level 3 combat
Total level of at least 500

[b]Rules:[/b]
No flaming/spamming
No racist comments
No comments about other peoples family&#39;s
No asking for a rank
No begging
Be polite/helpful

[b]Application:[/b]
Combat level:
Total level:
In-game name:
[/center]


If anybody could make that for me, that would be great!
Thanks!</description>
