    <title>Events with scripts... Hmm</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/events-with-scripts-hmm/155851</link>
    <description>i got this idea when i was trying to make a script which can be updated from that pkclient thing i made a few days ago, but i found i cant, cause it uses events.

i know bots already have an event system, like aryan had that ItemRespawnListener or something like that, but the stuff in my client had the most trivial things, like outOfPlayerLoop(),

i was thinking to have the script writer be responsible for whatever events are in there, like this

[code]public abstract class Script {

	public abstract void scriptStarting();
	public abstract void cycle();
	public abstract void scriptEnding();

	public abstract void addClientEvents(Map&lt;String, ClassGen&gt; classes);
}[/code]

but a problem with that is when you press &quot;Script -&gt; Reload Scripts&quot;, it wouldnt be able to call addClientEvents without reloading the whole client.

im kind of lost for what to do here, i guess you could just put a JOptionPane saying &quot;warning - this wont call addClientEvents() again&quot;, every time you press Reload Scripts.
or you could just make the whole thing with a normal script that has a new thread, but events are much more efficent..</description>

<p>yes thats a good idea, i remember eclipse debugger has a thing where you could replace classes, the idea was you fix a mistake and carry on testing it like nothings happened. they called it Hot Code Replace.</p>

<p>What about having a method that you call that returns a pattern that can be used to instrument the classes to add the required hook? You don’t even need to log out as you can use the redefine classes feature of the vm. You will have to use ASM (or <em>gasp</em> BCEL).</p>

<p>adding your own event call is much more efficent, since you dont need to calculate it, the clients already done it.</p>

<p>they’re really general, you can use DeadListener in many many scripts, but there could be scripts that need really specific things, and probably no other script would use them, ever. so its a bit of a waste to have a whole passage in your updater and event-dispatching part just to serve one script.</p>

              <p>Scripts should have one method of execution, it should account for everything that the script needs to do… However it should not account for randoms or banking.</p>
<p>There should be two threads, on the one thread we have have the script, on the other, we have the polling for the anti-randoms. If a random is detected, it should grab a synchronized lock on the script thread, and then handle the random… This includes inventory full events, where it should automatically walk to bank with a dynamic cartographer, and identify what it banks through the constrictions set by the executing script. Something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">/**
 * The base class which limits access to the actual client to the automated methods which you define.

 * @author ScriptAuthor
 */
public abstract class Script extends Automation {
    public abstract String getConstrictions();

<p>firstly, they should not be able to access anything that you do not have “hooked”, this is a given. when you generate your event messages, they will be sent to the bot to be dispatched to any listeners. it should be up to the scripter to implement the listener interfaces in order to have messages sent to the script</p>
<p>it is possible to do it how you wish, though, however i will not tell you because i see it as largely impractical <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>well i wasnt really thinking of adding it, maybe a bit later<br>
i was more intrested in the concept, how would you solve this problem, it would work for any bot i guess</p>
<p>i know about general event listeners, im more intrested in script-specific stuff, only one script would use it because its far too specific, going back to my outOfPlayerLoop example from before, unless you have a huge library of stuff like that, you probably wont find the exact one you need.<br>
im thinking of every script being able to add its own events</p>
<p>also moparisthebest, update your repository, cause i already added stuff like that for adding event calls in there</p>

              <p>I was actually going to add event based scripting into cherokee at one point, it is certainly possible to integrate with the threaded script system seamlessly, but I can’t tell you exactly how to do it without actually looking at it and thinking about it for awhile.  Off the top of my head, you could add static method calls into runescape (ScriptManager.someEvent(infohere)), if you are modifying the actual cherokee codebase you would have to think up some way so that the various methods could be defined from the .conf file, to keep ScriptManager non-runescape specific.</p>

              <p>i dont think so, apparantly when you do Component.dispatchEvent(), it delivers the event to what it thinks has focus, if there are more than 1 runescapes in the same jvm, it might give it to the wrong one :o</p>
<p>but why would many runescapes make a differance?</p>

              <p>i got this idea when i was trying to make a script which can be updated from that pkclient thing i made a few days ago, but i found i cant, cause it uses events.</p>
<p>i know bots already have an event system, like aryan had that ItemRespawnListener or something like that, but the stuff in my client had the most trivial things, like outOfPlayerLoop(),</p>
<p>i was thinking to have the script writer be responsible for whatever events are in there, like this</p>
<p>[code]public abstract class Script {</p>
<pre><code>public abstract void scriptStarting();
public abstract void cycle();
public abstract void scriptEnding();

public abstract void addClientEvents(Map&lt;String, ClassGen&gt; classes);
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>but a problem with that is when you press “Script -&gt; Reload Scripts”, it wouldnt be able to call addClientEvents without reloading the whole client.</p>
<p>im kind of lost for what to do here, i guess you could just put a JOptionPane saying “warning - this wont call addClientEvents() again”, every time you press Reload Scripts.<br>
or you could just make the whole thing with a normal script that has a new thread, but events are much more efficent…</p>
