[color=green]Completed
In-Progress
Not Started

This server is being created because we have spoken to many of people on many different communitys and most of them would like a PK server without any special donator advantages and without the standard PK points, this is a server where you &#39;Keep what you Kill&#39; so when you PK a AGS you can then sell this to the shop for cash, or you can just keep and use the item, there will be no special PK point requirement or donator status there are no shitty un-fair advantages, this server is here for those who are bored of skilling on RS or need a little more practice at PKing if they want to start on RS, basically this server is here for the community and for the community only, not just some randomer trying to make a bank out of it. 

Also we will be updating the server constantly and also the website where there will be events held and announced for those who keep in touch with the euPHoRia community so read on and stay with us over the next few days and we will all then be able to see the greatness, hope to see you on when were up and thank and rep+ if your supporting thanks.

One of the main ideas of this server is to create a PKing server which will ready you for the new Fagex update which is altering what they did to RS in &#39;07, So here we understand that many of you will most likely dump private servers and go back on to RS.However here we are creating a PK&#39;ing server which everyone will want to play, this is because it is not based on any Pk Point system it is based on good old fashioned you kill the player you get the loot, Although RuinScape crashed in &#39;07 i still think they were heading somewhere with the BountyHunter update this is why we have chosen to combine both bounty hunting with PK&#39;ing, therefore this enables everyone to PK in one area which will make it alot more fun because everyone will be their and not scattered in different PK areas although their may be some twists and turns its bountyhunter with players dropping there loots.

However, i do not w ant you all to think &#39;oh here we go heres another PK server trying to get money to put bread on the table&#39;, well your wrong although there may be some form of donation system in place this will not give any donator a un-fair advantage over the normal players, this is due to the fact that too many rich little kids steal mummys credit card and start thinking they are a vet pker because they are in full PvP armour, &#39;NO!&#39; this server will not be like this you will all have an equal oppurtunity, therefore showing the greater PKer.

We are looking to get this as close to RS combat as possible, this is because within the past few months i have visited other pickup servers (not mentioning any names) but items are overpowered and makes a server look scruffy, both the owners of this server have played RS for a very long time, i assure you im not a pubesent child and KNOW what everyone good wants, therefore all updates will be confirmed with the current players, we will have polls to review the update, everything is to satisfy the player.Anyway enough with the ranting on and on at you il get on to the real shit in telling you what we have done and not done lol, hope you enjoy your read and play if you come to join us, there will be constant updates on this thread and on the website so please come back daily and see what were up to.
More to Come...

MEDIA IS SOON TO COME

&lt;blockquote&gt;Firstly, you will start off as a level 3 with the starter pack ([COLOR=Red]2 Per IP[/COLOR]), then you will be able to choose how your char looks and the clothes he is wearing. After this process is complete this then allows you to now set your levels to whatever you want them to be NO TRAINING.

You can then either take a look around the shops and have a look round to see what you want to buy or you can start setting your levels.

Level Command: [COLOR=aqua]::SetLevel * **[/COLOR]    ,    * &lt;--Desired Skill ... ** &lt;-- Desired Level In Skill

Also there will be more commands as the server progresses, However we may already encorperate the ...
::Yell command as the server is building players this is so that everyone will be able to communicate with each other easily.
This is easily used by typing ::Yell (Type In Here + Without Brackets)

Now you have finished setting your levels you will now want some items, You will start with enough cash so that you can purchase your PK&#39;ing gear.

Dont worry you wont have to start buying all your runes and pots as you will start with thousands of runes and pots, this is so that you dont have to sit a shop buying them very slowly, this just makes it alot more efficient for the player.



[u][b]Current Starter Kit (Yet To Be Confirmed)[/b][/u]


The cash you will be starting with will be enough so that you can purchase mostly anything in the shops, this is more than enough for you to start PK&#39;ing. Although you start with this you will only be aloud 2 IP&#39;s worth of starters then after this you will be on your own, however for the rest of your starters you will recieve basic starter gear without cash.

So now you have got all your gear from the shops, now it is time to start PK&#39;ing this is exactly the same as normal PK&#39;ing bascially &#39;You Get What You Kill&#39; therefore you are still looting off the opponent, and then you are able to sell your Pk&#39;ed items back to the shop for more cash. 

More to Come ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thanks.</p>
<p>[color=red][/center][center][color=black]Hi, This is my first project on google. I have other accounts on other communitys which are quite similar to this one. I am looking forward to hopefully making a whole load of new friends, Anyway please dont hate on me but i do enjoy some constructive critisism.<br>
So Have Fun &amp; Read on.<br>
[color=red][/center][center][b]Introducing To[color=red]You…<br>

<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Thread Colour Key.</span></span><br>
[color=green]Completed<br>
In-Progress<br>
Not Started</p>
<p>This server is being created because we have spoken to many of people on many different communitys and most of them would like a PK server without any special donator advantages and without the standard PK points, this is a server where you ‘Keep what you Kill’ so when you PK a AGS you can then sell this to the shop for cash, or you can just keep and use the item, there will be no special PK point requirement or donator status there are no shitty un-fair advantages, this server is here for those who are bored of skilling on RS or need a little more practice at PKing if they want to start on RS, basically this server is here for the community and for the community only, not just some randomer trying to make a bank out of it.</p>
<p>Also we will be updating the server constantly and also the website where there will be events held and announced for those who keep in touch with the euPHoRia community so read on and stay with us over the next few days and we will all then be able to see the greatness, hope to see you on when were up and thank and rep+ if your supporting thanks.</p>
<p><img src="http://img813.imageshack.us/img813/5509/thebigplan.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>One of the main ideas of this server is to create a PKing server which will ready you for the new Fagex update which is altering what they did to RS in '07, So here we understand that many of you will most likely dump private servers and go back on to RS.However here we are creating a PK’ing server which everyone will want to play, this is because it is not based on any Pk Point system it is based on good old fashioned you kill the player you get the loot, Although RuinScape crashed in '07 i still think they were heading somewhere with the BountyHunter update this is why we have chosen to combine both bounty hunting with PK’ing, therefore this enables everyone to PK in one area which will make it alot more fun because everyone will be their and not scattered in different PK areas although their may be some twists and turns its bountyhunter with players dropping there loots.</p>
<p>However, i do not w ant you all to think ‘oh here we go heres another PK server trying to get money to put bread on the table’, well your wrong although there may be some form of donation system in place this will not give any donator a un-fair advantage over the normal players, this is due to the fact that too many rich little kids steal mummys credit card and start thinking they are a vet pker because they are in full PvP armour, ‘NO!’ this server will not be like this you will all have an equal oppurtunity, therefore showing the greater PKer.</p>
<p>We are looking to get this as close to RS combat as possible, this is because within the past few months i have visited other pickup servers (not mentioning any names) but items are overpowered and makes a server look scruffy, both the owners of this server have played RS for a very long time, i assure you im not a pubesent child and KNOW what everyone good wants, therefore all updates will be confirmed with the current players, we will have polls to review the update, everything is to satisfy the player.Anyway enough with the ranting on and on at you il get on to the real shit in telling you what we have done and not done lol, hope you enjoy your read and play if you come to join us, there will be constant updates on this thread and on the website so please come back daily and see what were up to.<br>
More to Come…</p>

<p>MEDIA IS SOON TO COME</p>
<p><img src="http://img214.imageshack.us/img214/6273/whattodo.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<blockquote>Firstly, you will start off as a level 3 with the starter pack ([COLOR=Red]2 Per IP[/COLOR]), then you will be able to choose how your char looks and the clothes he is wearing. After this process is complete this then allows you to now set your levels to whatever you want them to be NO TRAINING.
<p>You can then either take a look around the shops and have a look round to see what you want to buy or you can start setting your levels.</p>
<p>Level Command: [COLOR=aqua]::SetLevel * **[/COLOR]    ,    * &lt;–Desired Skill … ** &lt;-- Desired Level In Skill</p>
<p>Also there will be more commands as the server progresses, However we may already encorperate the …<br>
::Yell command as the server is building players this is so that everyone will be able to communicate with each other easily.<br>
This is easily used by typing ::Yell (Type In Here + Without Brackets)</p>
<p>Now you have finished setting your levels you will now want some items, You will start with enough cash so that you can purchase your PK’ing gear.</p>
<p>Dont worry you wont have to start buying all your runes and pots as you will start with thousands of runes and pots, this is so that you dont have to sit a shop buying them very slowly, this just makes it alot more efficient for the player.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Current Starter Kit (Yet To Be Confirmed)</span></span></p>
<p>The cash you will be starting with will be enough so that you can purchase mostly anything in the shops, this is more than enough for you to start PK’ing. Although you start with this you will only be aloud 2 IP’s worth of starters then after this you will be on your own, however for the rest of your starters you will recieve basic starter gear without cash.</p>
<p>So now you have got all your gear from the shops, now it is time to start PK’ing this is exactly the same as normal PK’ing bascially ‘You Get What You Kill’ therefore you are still looting off the opponent, and then you are able to sell your Pk’ed items back to the shop for more cash.</p>
<p>More to Come …</p>
