    <title>Problem with possibly death timers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-possibly-death-timers/242931</link>
    <description>Ok whenever someone makes a new account (this is delta base but not exactly delta) It says the player has killed himself. And sometimes you die randomly. I would really like to get this server up and running because i want to bring my flourshing server into the next generation.

Here is a piece of my code:
[code]	public void dealDamage(int amt) {
		((client) this).debug(&quot;Dealing &quot; + amt + &quot; damage to you (hp=&quot;
				+ currentHealth + &quot;)&quot;);
		currentHealth -= amt;
		if (currentHealth &lt;= 0) {
			((client) this).debug(&quot;Triggering death timer&quot;);
			currentHealth = 0;
			deathStage = 1;
			deathTimer = System.currentTimeMillis();
		} else {
			/*
			 * if(amt == 0){ if (playerEquipment[playerShield] == -1){ pEmote = 404; }
			 * else { pEmote = 403; } }
			 */
		}
	}[/code]
and another piece of code

[code]		if(AttackingOn2.deathStage != 0 || AttackingOn2.currentHealth &lt;= 0)
		return;
	    	int hit = misc.random(playerMaxHit) + misc.random(StrPrayer) + misc.random(extraDamage) + misc.random(voidmelee);
		int aBonus = 0;
		int rand_att = misc.random(playerLevel[0])*3 + misc.random(AtkPray * 8);
		int rand_def = (int) (0.65 * misc.random(AttackingOn2.playerLevel[1]) + AttackingOn2.DefPray * 8);
		if(AttackingOn2.ProtMelee){
		rand_def += misc.random(100);
		}[/code]

someone please help I would greatly appreciate it!</description>
