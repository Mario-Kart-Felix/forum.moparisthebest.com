    <title>Barriers to Npcs and No following after death</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/barriers-to-npcs-and-no-following-after-death/142612</link>
    <description>Okay this has been a problem chasing me throughout the entire time I tinker with these. I can&#39;t figure out how to set objects to be unwalkable to Npcs, and if they kill me or anyone else kills me, they will go from their location to whereever I respawn. I&#39;m out of ideas atm, does anyone have any ideas. If there was a tutorial on this I didn&#39;t find it.</description>
