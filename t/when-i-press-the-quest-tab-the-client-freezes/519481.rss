    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/when-i-press-the-quest-tab-the-client-freezes/519481</link>
    <description>Ok, so i have tested it with owner, admin, mod, and normal player, and everytime i click the Quest tab my client freezes... i just recently got my client compiler working and once it was working (no errors) i guess it changed then... because it was working before.  Here is a quick picture of what the CMD says when it freezes
