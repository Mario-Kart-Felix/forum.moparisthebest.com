    <title>Server base with a good 317 cache?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-base-with-a-good-317-cache/375448</link>
    <description>  I&#39;ve been looking through the server downloads for a decent 317 base. All of the ones I come across have problems with loading the height levels of areas throughout Runescape. For example, I haven&#39;t found one server base that can process the cache for upstairs in the Slayer Tower. I haven&#39;t found one server base that can process the cache for the Tree Gnome Agility Course when you climb up, the entire screen will go white. You technically are on the second floor, it just doesn&#39;t process the graphics.
  Is it rather simple to add new animations (for example, skill cape emotes) to your server when you don&#39;t have them? Is this related to the cache?
  Also, I have found that some bases can&#39;t process the mini map fast, so the monsters and the little Runescape signs that you see on there don&#39;t process when they should.
  Are these things that are fixable and can be done with persistence? I&#39;m still in the process of learning the client-sided part of making servers.</description>

              <p>I appreciate the help xxx123xxx. By any chance, do you know of any 459 or 474 deob clients? 317 seemed nice, but I like the 459 interface, along with the prayers, godwars, and everything else. I know I could add them to a 317 server, but why be bothered when I can get a 459 deob?</p>

              <p>A 317 deob is a basic client with no modifications what’s so ever, the cache is completely clean. I recommend that you go with a clean build meaning that fixes have been made to make it more stable and fixed, e.g. prayer. The one by Pablo seams really good, it has all the fixes, you just have to add the items and model preloading which is pretty easy.</p>

              <p>Sorry if I sound a little dumb asking this, but I have little to no knowledge about loading maps and cache shit. So when you say why not just get a clean 317 deob? What do you mean by that? Is it easy to get? Would I be able to load that to a base that I have rather simply?</p>
