Dark Moon is a new PvP based server. You earn points by killing people and winning parkour/games. They will give you points to which you level up with or purchase upgrades/items with. The survival world includes a nether and open world PvP. It uses towny and you can create a town or even a nation with friends and create many enemies! You start out with chain mail armor and basic tools and a iron sword. We have many parkour courses that range from short to long and easy to hard. We have 8 games that you can play that include
