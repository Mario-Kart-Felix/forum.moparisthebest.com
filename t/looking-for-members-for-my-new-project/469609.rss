    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-members-for-my-new-project/469609</link>
    <description>Hello guys, I am not sure if this is the right section, but let me continue.

I have owned several servers and they were decent and with an accrive community. All of them were 317&#39;s btw.

I am looking for staff and one coder/developer with me.

If you are interested, please, reply below.</description>
