    <description>So before we updated the client certain people were complaining about the client freezing. We updated but nothing was changed that I thought would affect freezing in any way, shape or form but certain people claim it&#39;s resolved but equally as many are now saying the client freezes but it didn&#39;t with the old version. No output what-so-ever, the applet just freezes. Now I&#39;ve never experienced this on any client version but after formatting I now freeze all the time. I then formatted again and it resolved it... I can&#39;t replicate the problem to try and resolve it.

Anyone with in depth client knowledge got any suggestions on how to reduce freezes?

Oh and also, when I push CTRL + ALT + DEL on Windows 7 Ultimate the client freezes.</description>

I think in RSCE, it’s possibly camera/teleporting based, whenever I froze it was when I went through a portal to teleport holding the camera left or right button, i have a habbit of that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

I’ve frozen on pretty much every server I’ve ever been on, I can also make EasyRSC freeze by pushing CTRL + ALT + DEL.[/quote]</p>
<p>Wish I could freeze clients like you. Pro sauce.</p>
