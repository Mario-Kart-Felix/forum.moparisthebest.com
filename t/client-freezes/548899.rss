    <description>Okay i am using the source aggroth v4, both source and client.

2 solutions, first soultion when im using the client without it being jared then it works completely fine when i teleport around the server.
second problem is that once its jared its freezes when i teleport to places?

I am new to coding never mind editing the client, but i have done some research and i could believe its to do with the cache? but how do i get another one? does it need to be aggroths or any client?

any help is appreciated, skype name is jason.b451 if you would like to contact.
Thank you!</description>
