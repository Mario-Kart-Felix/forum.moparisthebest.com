    <description>okay so i am running on crazy pvp&#39;s source(a delta) and i need a code for when a player logs in for the first time an npc (i dont give a damn which) says something like &quot;welcome to nightmarescape PvP!&quot;(click to continue) &quot;the basic commands are: ~::master,::pickup,and ::home&quot; (click to continue) &quot;for any other questions please refer to the nightmarescape staff or experienced players&quot; i know that is probably a lot to ask,but ive been coding for like  3 hrs straight now and my head hurts really bad,so it would be very much appreciated

~thanks in advance!
