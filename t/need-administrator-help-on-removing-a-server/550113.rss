    <title>Need administrator help on removing a server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-administrator-help-on-removing-a-server/550113</link>
    <description>Hey there,

So a friend of mine had put my server on Moparscape somewhere in December, but for some reason he didn&#39;t want to work on it anymore and quit it.
I have no access to the account he made the advertisement on and I would like to post a new server running on the same IP since I&#39;m still the owner of the VPS on that IP.

Can someone contact me about the removal of the server so I can make a new one? He already changed the name to &#39;Remove please&#39;.



Thanks in advance,

Lorenz</description>
