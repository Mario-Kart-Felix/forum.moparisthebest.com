    <title>Need a little BCEL help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-little-bcel-help/172104</link>
    <description>Well basically some of you may already know me(hint: im Fiori), a lot of others wont. If you don&#39;t hello :)

But anyway onto the point,  i have basically been fiddling with BCEL a  little bit and trying to hook various FIELDs from the client but i have run into a little problem. 

The problem seems to be the way i load all of the classes. Well my so called &quot;ClassLoader&quot; loads all the rs classes from a folder into a ClassGen[]
Here is its code:
http://pastebin.com/m3a38cd11

Now it seems to load them all just fine. The output can be found here:
http://pastebin.com/md560a9d

But when i go to outprint the contents of the ClassGen[] i get a null value. A sample of the output looks like this(notice the null value):[code]
org.apache.bcel.generic.ClassGen@d96
org.apache.bcel.generic.ClassGen@d97
org.apache.bcel.generic.ClassGen@d98
null
org.apache.bcel.generic.ClassGen@d99
org.apache.bcel.generic.ClassGen@d9a
org.apache.bcel.generic.ClassGen@d9b
org.apache.bcel.generic.ClassGen@6e[/code]

The full output is here(http://pastebin.com/m799b4ec8)

This is a problem, because when my code goes to sift through the values of my ClassGen[], and say creates a PoolGen for each value, it comes to the null and causes a NullPointerException

I apologize that was long, but if anyone could please help i would very much appreciete it.

Thank you, 
Fiori

EDIT:Here is an output of me looping through all the classes. The nullpointer occures where it says &quot;Null man is gay&quot;:

<p>Yeah, he created a ClassGen array with 208 spaces, and since the META-INF folder doesn’t end in “.class” the “if(f.list().indexOf(”.class") != -1)" statement doesn’t add it to the ClassGen array (it shouldn’t anyway): one space stays empty, null, causing a NullPointerException.</p>
<p>I agree with the ArrayList thing though, suggested it to him on irc.<br>
^ Edit:<br>
 wooo i got it working<br>
 arraylists.</p>

<p>Don’t use Repository to load the class as it can pick the classes up from anywhere. There again i would use ASM so you don’t come across the bugs in bcel.</p>
