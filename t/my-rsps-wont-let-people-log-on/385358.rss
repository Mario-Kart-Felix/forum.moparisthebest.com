    <title>My RSPS Won&#39;t Let People Log On!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-rsps-wont-let-people-log-on/385358</link>
    <description>Hey guys,I just wanted to try to solve my problem by asking you guys.
A while back I wanted to start a RSPS,and so I did.
Now,I have the basic&#39;s down.
I have PortForwarded(43594)
Got a No-ip DannySkapez.no-ip.org for host.
Got a source(317-377)
Now,I have spent a long time coding The Source,and I&#39;m not giving up now.
What happens is,I can log in,but when I put the Client download link up,
My friends cannotlog on.
Now,I&#39;m EXTREMELY new to coding,Like Iv&#39;e been coding for about a week but I learn fast.
So I know that the problem is in the Client folder,under GUI,the IP,I have no idea what I should set it to,My IP,My no-ip,or to 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1
There is also my source/files folder,and I need to change the IP in the &quot;server&quot; files,and I don&#39;t know what I should put in their either.There is also another file that needs an IP changed in the Client.java class under the Source/files.
IF you can help me I would SO GREATLY APRECIATE IT!!!
Thanks For Reading! :cool:

What I have So Far:

Under Source Files:The Ports are 43594,and the Default port is 43594,So I soppose that is right.ALSO,under the source files,there is a client notepad,And in there the IP is set to My no-ip,Correct me if I am wrong please.

Secondly,

My Client Folder:

There is ONLY  The GUI,and THE IP IN THERE IS MY NO-IP!
AND ALSO,there was something set to port off,so I switched it to 43594. 
CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG PLEASE

Thank you!</description>

              <p>[quote=“fatmom78, post:12, topic:385358”]THE CLIENT YOU USE should connect to 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>THE CLIENT OTHER PEOPLE USE should connect to <a href="http://DannySkapez.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">DannySkapez.no-ip.org</a></p>
<p>so copy your client and have one for yourself and one for other people</p>
<p>example:<br>
Danny’s Client – the ip should be 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>DannySkapez Client – ip should be <a href="http://dannyskapez.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">dannyskapez.no-ip.org</a></p>
<p>Hope this helps! :)[/quote]</p>
<p>^^CORRECT!<br>
Rule 2:<br>
Everybody is equal, don’t treat people worse than you do others(E.G., don’t isolate someone and flame them).<br>

              <p>THE CLIENT YOU USE should connect to 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>THE CLIENT OTHER PEOPLE USE should connect to <a href="http://DannySkapez.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">DannySkapez.no-ip.org</a></p>
<p>so copy your client and have one for yourself and one for other people</p>
<p>example:<br>
Danny’s Client – the ip should be 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>DannySkapez Client – ip should be <a href="http://dannyskapez.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">dannyskapez.no-ip.org</a></p>
<p>Hope this helps! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Hey guys,I just wanted to try to solve my problem by asking you guys.<br>
A while back I wanted to start a RSPS,and so I did.<br>
Now,I have the basic’s down.<br>
I have PortForwarded(43594)<br>
Got a No-ip <a href="http://DannySkapez.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">DannySkapez.no-ip.org</a> for host.<br>
Got a source(317-377)<br>
Now,I have spent a long time coding The Source,and I’m not giving up now.<br>
What happens is,I can log in,but when I put the Client download link up,<br>
My friends cannotlog on.<br>
Now,I’m EXTREMELY new to coding,Like Iv’e been coding for about a week but I learn fast.<br>
So I know that the problem is in the Client folder,under GUI,the IP,I have no idea what I should set it to,My IP,My no-ip,or to 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1<br>
There is also my source/files folder,and I need to change the IP in the “server” files,and I don’t know what I should put in their either.There is also another file that needs an IP changed in the Client.java class under the Source/files.<br>
IF you can help me I would SO GREATLY APRECIATE IT!!!<br>
Thanks For Reading! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>
<p>What I have So Far:</p>
<p>Under Source Files:The Ports are 43594,and the Default port is 43594,So I soppose that is right.ALSO,under the source files,there is a client notepad,And in there the IP is set to My no-ip,Correct me if I am wrong please.</p>
<p>Secondly,</p>
<p>My Client Folder:</p>
<p>There is ONLY  The GUI,and THE IP IN THERE IS MY NO-IP!<br>
AND ALSO,there was something set to port off,so I switched it to 43594.<br>
CORRECT ME IF I AM WRONG PLEASE</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
