    <title>[REQ] Good Source and Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-good-source-and-client/543331</link>
    <description>Before I go anywhere with this post I would first like to say I have looked through so many threads, searched through pages and pages on google, I cannot find a good source and client that suites what I am looking for and was wondering if anyone on here could help me out.

Okay now to the point, I am looking for a good source and client that&#39;s not totally loaded with customs etc, I would like to find one that has fully working skilling, a good combat system, and most npcs where they belong. I also was hoping to find one that had Vesta, Chaotics, and Nex Gear.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, please don&#39;t flame me. :p</description>
