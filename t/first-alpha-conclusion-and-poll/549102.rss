    <title>First alpha conclusion [And poll]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/first-alpha-conclusion-and-poll/549102</link>
    <description>Thank you so much to everyone that logged in and helped us find and test the server today. Because the server is in such a buggy state, (I&#39;m looking at you, Mr. Login Crash) I&#39;ve decided to keep this alpha test to just one day and shut the server off for now. 

Thanks to you guys we realized that the server is not quite as ready as we had hoped, and we&#39;re going to be working hard to move towards our launches! Because of this, the next public testing day is going to be another alpha and we aren&#39;t moving to beta quite yet. Special thanks to everyone that made sure to post their bugs on the forums so we can keep them logged and start working on fixing them all.


I will announce the next public alpha date soon, but expect it to be sometime in the next two weeks.</description>

              <p>The next alpha will have something more like a 10-20x xp rate. I wanted this one to be a bit slow so that we could get some quality testing on low end content before people were moving up to high end (plus we dont have high end done yet, so it woulda just been a bunch of level 60s killing chickens and cows)</p>

              <p>Are the private testers (Ex: me) able to still do stuff or have we moved to the point where the testing is only public (Meaning we only test on whatever days it’s hosted)?</p>
<p>It was fun, I expected bugs and etc, but we couldn’t accomplish much extensive testing (Mostly skill related) because of the low XP rates. I’m not saying the rates are bad for a server, but for alpha testing it is. It’s kinda hard to test things you cannot access (Ex: better armour)</p>
<p>And to anyone that says to just earn the money/items: There’s no fudgeing way to. Everything that you can sell, sells for like 1-5gp. And the rest is going to be stuff you already bought, so when selling it, it will give less than it’s value. There are no commands for the testers. And, you must not have tried it yourself.</p>
