    <description>Hi guys, I&#39;m making an achievement tab from scratch and I was wondering how to &quot;check player stats&quot; before using it. like say if the achievement was all 99s and a player hasent got that but he clicks on the achievement. it will not give him the reward. I want that plus how do you do it so it only works once?</description>
