    <description>Basically, I can&#39;t find what&#39;s wrong with my start. I haven&#39;t made a server in ages. wanted to get back into it, I can&#39;t get my start working with the issue, it&#39;s something to do with the directry of Java right? But I can&#39;t remember how to fix it, I&#39;ve tried editing it etc

Getting -
[code]The system cannot find the path specified.
Press any key to continue . . .

[/code]

My directory for the My JDK = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_03\bin

Thanks</description>
