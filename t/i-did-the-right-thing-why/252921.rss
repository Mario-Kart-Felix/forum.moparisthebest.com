    <title>I did the right thing... WHY?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-did-the-right-thing-why/252921</link>
    <description>Well today I went to Future Shop to go and get my iPod Touch.. sold out. Pissed off, I had to drive a long way to get to Best Buy to get it.

The sales representative told me that she&#39;s going to take it out of the case (where all the other ones are stored) and by the time I get up to the register they will have it there for me, as a security precaution. As I was in line, she goes to me and says, &quot;I&#39;m busy soo.. I guess I could trust you with this.&quot; Hands it to me, and walks away to do her business. I realized I could then just walk out with something that&#39;s $280 and get away with it.

Why I did not take the chance? I don&#39;t fucking know..

By the way, the alarm at the exit would not have gone off because there are no security chips/etc.. in the iPod&#39;s casing. And even that, I could have just taken the iPod out of the casing by removing the tape..

WHY GOD WHY.</description>

<p>No, not at all. The topic is still on subject.</p>
<p>Squig, I’m with you. I don’t believe doing good things will result in good things, but doing something good could make you feel better, resulting in a different view of things? idno[/quote]<br>

Religion is always tempting. There are many questions, such as why are we here, how did we get here, and what happens when we die. People have been thinking about this as long as they exist. They tried to answer these questions, but obviously, they couldn’t. So the best explanation would be a higher power. Something that created everything, something that looks after us. And, if you go back a few thousand years, explains natural events such as thunder, lightning or even the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>If I’m correct, karma is part of Buddhism. So is reincarnation (it doesn’t really matter what religion it is). This is another way to explain what happens after we die. It’s tempting too: especially when you think about it longer then a few seconds. I thought it over a while ago, and stumbled on something: How to explain the increasing number of humans? Where do all the souls come from? But the answer to that is simple: animals die. Which would mean that the number of humans and animals are connected, and never change.</p>
<p>But you need karma, and that’s where it derails. There is no such thing as karma. Some people don’t have luck in their lives, does this mean they did something wrong? African children, whose parents died, who suffer from aids: Did they do something wrong? I doubt it.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yes, they did do something wrong.<br>
The proof for me that karma exists, is that i already noticed this law before i even knew karma.</p>
<p>Im an observer, i really don’t like to talk too much like most of my friends.<br>
They talk their way into life, i just observe.I think that’s why i notice some things most people dont.</p>
<p>anyway, the world is logical. You can compare the world to a game that is programmed with all kind of laws and many other things. For example: Luck, is determined by all kinds of things, it just doesn’t happen because you got “lucky”.<br>
Karma determines your looks, your family, the enviroment you were born in. Just remember that it’s all logical.</p>
<p>Bring me 100 or maybe even 1000 people who disaprove with my opinion, i would still believe it 100% no doubt.[/quote]<br>
Would you believe in my point though? That karma, while it doesnt govern the universe, exists soley for the individuals that believe in it. And Whether you notice it or not, nothing is different, other than how you perceive your world and how you explain good and bad things to yourself</p>

              <p>yes, but did that happen because you did something ‘good’? or was it merely the predetermined line that was going to happen regardless of whether you did ‘good’ or not?</p>
<p>i for one lean more towards the latter of the two. You cannot prove that good things happen because of good events. Many good things come from doing bad things.</p>
<p>but, mearly having a belief in karma, makes it exist. for you only In all the good things you get as you will assosiate them with something youve done in the past. Now whether karma exists in a greater form than just in your mind is not only debatable but also unprovable.</p>

If you don’t believe everything i say. Why don’t you test it yourself?<br>
Do good things everyday for a few weeks, and notice the changes. Just observe whatever happens.</p>
<p>I’ll give an example: I used to have friends who bullied people. I stopped doing that and my friends didn’t respect me anymore. It was like i was losing my friends, but i still didn’t join their bullying.<br>
After a while some older people noticed that and i became friends with those people.<br>
Those other friends of mine looked up to those older people.<br>
So … i think you’ll know what happened<br>
gotta go now</p>

Have you ever thought about why there are so many injustices everyday?</p>
<p>I believe in reincarnation.<br>
With this said, let’s say if you were a bad person in your past life and in this life you’re a good person.<br>
Now that you’re a good person, bad things still happen to you and you ask yourself why.<br>
That’s because karma is paying you back.</p>

<p>i understand exactly what your saying, i just dont believe in it. At least not certain parts.<br>
I dont for one believe for one second in reincarnation. And your explanation of Karma is making it sound like a religion… just as plausible as one too.<br>
i believe in doing good things with the aim to have good things come to you. But i dont believe that doing said good things makes those good things come any faster.<br>
In doing a good thing, the chain of events that come next may in turn make something good come to you faster, but not because you did something good, but because you did something, good or bad.</p>

<p>i believe with your belief but not necessarily with the way you believe it.</p>
<p>I believe everything happens for a reason, but i dont believe in karma. Bad people get good things, and bad things happen to good people. Thats not karma. But, those things happened for a reason.</p>
<p>A person that goes out of there way to do good every day is just as likely to be struck down as a serial killer. The many injustices in the world make it clear to me everyday.</p>
<p>but in essense i guess the possibility of 2 paths is possible. So, each decision you make leads down a different path. So take this ipod for example. 2 predetermined paths. A free ipod, and the starter to a life of eventual crime, and a payed ipod, and the starter for an honest life.</p>
