        <p>yes, but did that happen because you did something ‘good’? or was it merely the predetermined line that was going to happen regardless of whether you did ‘good’ or not?</p>
<p>i for one lean more towards the latter of the two. You cannot prove that good things happen because of good events. Many good things come from doing bad things.</p>
<p>but, mearly having a belief in karma, makes it exist. for you only In all the good things you get as you will assosiate them with something youve done in the past. Now whether karma exists in a greater form than just in your mind is not only debatable but also unprovable.</p>

        <p>Religion is always tempting. There are many questions, such as why are we here, how did we get here, and what happens when we die. People have been thinking about this as long as they exist. They tried to answer these questions, but obviously, they couldn’t. So the best explanation would be a higher power. Something that created everything, something that looks after us. And, if you go back a few thousand years, explains natural events such as thunder, lightning or even the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>If I’m correct, karma is part of Buddhism. So is reincarnation (it doesn’t really matter what religion it is). This is another way to explain what happens after we die. It’s tempting too: especially when you think about it longer then a few seconds. I thought it over a while ago, and stumbled on something: How to explain the increasing number of humans? Where do all the souls come from? But the answer to that is simple: animals die. Which would mean that the number of humans and animals are connected, and never change.</p>
<p>But you need karma, and that’s where it derails. There is no such thing as karma. Some people don’t have luck in their lives, does this mean they did something wrong? African children, whose parents died, who suffer from aids: Did they do something wrong? I doubt it.</p>

        <p>[quote=“R.I.P RSC, post:43, topic:252921”]Religion is always tempting. There are many questions, such as why are we here, how did we get here, and what happens when we die. People have been thinking about this as long as they exist. They tried to answer these questions, but obviously, they couldn’t. So the best explanation would be a higher power. Something that created everything, something that looks after us. And, if you go back a few thousand years, explains natural events such as thunder, lightning or even the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>If I’m correct, karma is part of Buddhism. So is reincarnation (it doesn’t really matter what religion it is). This is another way to explain what happens after we die. It’s tempting too: especially when you think about it longer then a few seconds. I thought it over a while ago, and stumbled on something: How to explain the increasing number of humans? Where do all the souls come from? But the answer to that is simple: animals die. Which would mean that the number of humans and animals are connected, and never change.</p>
<p>But you need karma, and that’s where it derails. There is no such thing as karma. Some people don’t have luck in their lives, does this mean they did something wrong? African children, whose parents died, who suffer from aids: Did they do something wrong? I doubt it.[/quote]<br>
Yes, they did do something wrong.<br>
The proof for me that karma exists, is that i already noticed this law before i even knew karma.</p>
<p>Im an observer, i really don’t like to talk too much like most of my friends.<br>
They talk their way into life, i just observe.I think that’s why i notice some things most people dont.</p>
<p>anyway, the world is logical. You can compare the world to a game that is programmed with all kind of laws and many other things. For example: Luck, is determined by all kinds of things, it just doesn’t happen because you got “lucky”.<br>
Karma determines your looks, your family, the enviroment you were born in. Just remember that it’s all logical.</p>
<p>Bring me 100 or maybe even 1000 people who disaprove with my opinion, i would still believe it 100% no doubt.</p>

Would you believe in my point though? That karma, while it doesnt govern the universe, exists soley for the individuals that believe in it. And Whether you notice it or not, nothing is different, other than how you perceive your world and how you explain good and bad things to yourself</p>

        <p>I understand exactly what you’re trying to say.<br>
For example, the Law of Attraction. Some people tried to think of something and they magically see whatever they were thinking about. It wouldn’t matter if you would think of it or not, you would still see it.<br>
It’s just because you are paying attention on the object, that you suddenly start seeing this object everywhere.</p>
<p>I think that’s what you’re trying to explain.<br>
That if i believe in Karma and something happens, i will link it to karma.</p>
