    <title>Ideas of Future World Governments?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ideas-of-future-world-governments/521576</link>
    <description>Well this idea has been making me so angry because it will never come true, but here I go.  I believe the only way for future space exploration is too have a one world government.  Now will this work you might say. Okay think of the united states, each country will act like a state with in this one world government.  And the country will go on with its laws, but will follow the Earth&#39;s laws for example if the The Earth&#39;s government puts down a decent tax rate for each country to pay..they must pay that or the country will be striped away of its power unless it can pay it back (this will be done aggressively action, but not as small as simple taxes)(aggressive actions would mean the leader for that country will be thrown out of power or some agreement will me made). But how will this government operate with laws?  There will be a leader of Earth, but not a dictator, and all of Earth&#39;s leaders will act like a representative of their country and will be allowed to vote of Earth or Space problems which include mass murders in country and attacks from other planets and problems on other colonized planets. Now the powers of the Leader Earth is something too nearly nothing. He/She is basically a spokes person to Earth&#39;s people and try to make each county get along.  Now there will be no need for military for each country since The Earth&#39;s government will control it, yet each country will have its own security forces that control and keep crime levels down, but really no need for the military for each country. 

Now this is just a simple idea of a space exploration government, but really have no clue if it will work.  What do you guys think of this and what do you think is the future of World governments?</description>

              <p>The problem with power is corruption, you said that each country would be like a state to this ultimate system. I think you’re forgetting that some countries government aren’t peaceful. Taking away their powers or threatening this, because of the way they enforce their laws and beliefs, will only lead to bigger problems and outbreaks of war. Countries have to agree to this system, without their permission this would not work. This is just a lost hope of controlling others in order to advance in a direction which is difficult, pointless.</p>
<p>In order to travel space freely, without reason to think of being attacked by another country, we would need to have peace in all countries. There are little to no chance of that happening as those countries who are corrupted by government won’t allow it, and only those who are willing to kill get into government.</p>
<p>The legal system is a difficult system to uphold, it isn’t as easy as throwing a group of old men with one leader saying that they’re a neutral party. It just won’t happen.</p>
