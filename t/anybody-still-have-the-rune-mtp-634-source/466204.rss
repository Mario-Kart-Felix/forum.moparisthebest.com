<p>If I this ever worked, which it hasn’t, you’re only doing this to rip some code from it? Kind of pathetic.<br>
If anything beg us all for a absolutely AMAZING source that had it’s DL links removed and then maybe… just maybe someone will be kind enough to give it you if you had the right reasons.<br>

lol have you never ripped code?[/quote]<br>
No I actually have NOT ripped code from a source I begged an entire rsps community for. But I have a better question for you…ever try coding without copy and pasting and ripping code? hmm?</p>
