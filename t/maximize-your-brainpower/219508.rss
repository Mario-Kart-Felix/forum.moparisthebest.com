    <description>Improve your mental well-being with this book of brand new mental tests in the IQ Workout Series…

Despite the enormous capacity of the human brain, we only utilise on average two per cent of our potential brainpower. There is, therefore, the potential for each of us to considerably expand our brainpower.

Maximise Your Brainpower provides readers with a series of mental workouts covering areas of creative thinking, problem solving, memory, logical thought, mental agility and intelligence. Chapters are each designed to exercise a different kind of brain activity, with a series of newly compiled exercises, puzzles and tests.

Use this and other books in The IQ Workout Series as a fun and informative way of testing, assessing, and expanding your brainpower!

Ken Russell and Philip Carter are MENSA Puzzle Editors and have compiled nearly 100 books on all aspects of testing, puzzles and crosswords.

- A hints section is provided for the more difficult tests and puzzles.
- Answers together with detailed explanations, where necessary, are provided for all puzzles and tests.
- A guide to assessing performance is provided for each of the IQ tests in the Intelligence Test section, and for tests in other sections where appropriate.
