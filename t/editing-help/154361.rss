break;[/code]

Now, I click on object 0 and get 1 fletching cape and i want to get all of the capes at once. If their levels are correct. How could i edit this so that when i clicked on it and had 100 in each stat i would get all 27 skillcapes?</description>

<p>Now, I click on object 0 and get 1 fletching cape and i want to get all of the capes at once. If their levels are correct. How could i edit this so that when i clicked on it and had 100 in each stat i would get all 27 skillcapes?</p>
