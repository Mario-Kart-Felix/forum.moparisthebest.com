    <description>M&#39;kay so I was trying to get that port forwarding thing offa mod taharoks guide..

Eh I couldn&#39;t, but I was telling all the IPs of me I could find because finally I got a server running.

We are in the same ham network so he could get on.

So if you use hamachi you don&#39;t need to do that port forwarding stuff or what??!</description>

              <p>I did that earlier.</p>
<p>It brought me to some site for my computer and yeah.</p>
<p>What do I do from there?<br>
Can I get my Router’s IP off of it…[br][size=1]Posted on: February 24, 2007, 01:24:22 PM[/size][hr]"[b]Now we will need to make the rule for your router, by doing this you need to go into your router. You can do this by going into Internet Explorer (or whatever client you use for the Internet), and then type in the IP address of the router. Now log into the router and go into “advanced” (at top of screen on mine). Then on the sidebar to the left click the “gaming” button (is only left side for me…) Then you need to make a new rule and fill in the blanks with this information:</p>
<p>Name: 1<br>
IP address: 2<br>
TCP Ports to open: 43594<br>
UDP Ports to open:<br>
Inbound Filter: Allow All<br>
Schedule: Always[/b]"</p>
<p>That’s what I’m trying to do…</p>
<p>Is the router ip and the ones off of like ipchicken the same thing?</p>
<p>And anyways, if so I don’t know what to do when in my router…<br>
It’s confusing o.o<br>
There’s no advanced option at top or anything… just a list of them</p>
