    <description>Welcome antcolony3!
Further Action Required, Read:
New server -Bass-Scape- succesfully entered, however it will not show up on the list until it has been verified and approved.
Your server will now be checked by logging into it with the following credentials: 
Username: 7SHalzA 
Password: hFzmBS0 
to make sure it is online, and if successful, it will be posted. 
You must register this username and password for me on your server and allow it to be logged into from the IP 69.39.224.55
The server will be deleted from the queue if not verified and logged into within 24 hours of posting.</description>
