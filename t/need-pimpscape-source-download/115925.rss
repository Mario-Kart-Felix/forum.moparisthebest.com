    <title>Need PimpScape Source Download!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-pimpscape-source-download/115925</link>
    <description>Ok, well i downloaded a moparscape server package a few weeks ago. I didnt bak up the pimpscape source (the only 1 i rlly like/understand), and i completely screwed up the coding in it!  theres like a thousand+ errors that i dont know how to fix. too many to post on here.

i didnt do much work on it, so if somebody could give me a pimpscape source download (1 that hasnt been messed around that much), it would be Awesome!

THANKS!
