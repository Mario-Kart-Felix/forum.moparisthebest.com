<p>Zach is very good at adding content, but the stability of the server suffers. Hence things like random trade dc’s with lost items, and the shops don’t even work with multiple players. I might release DSv8, which fixes all of those things and has party room and general store. (Never worked correctly on a 508 before :P)</p>

<p>For content yes, but it lacks stability substantially.</p>
