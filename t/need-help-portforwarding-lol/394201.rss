              <p>why do you need to be spoonfed on port forwarding o.o? all you do is go into your router by typing your default gateway username and pass default for most routers is admin admin and go to port forwarding/triggering (well for mine) then add a custom service name it w/e just make sure you put in port starts port ends both 43594 and your set please try harder next time =/</p>

              <p>Right click your network icon at the bottom of the screen, open the Network and Sharing Center, on your network, click it, then click Properties. When that loads, it should display your gateways, ipv4, ipv6, default, etc. Memorize your iPv4 Address, as this is the one you will be portfowarding. Now… most people use Linksys/Cisco as it’s the major brand for Wireless Technology/Router (I think…), so, go to your page (192.168.1.1) in your web browser, and successfully. In your port-fowarding tab, foward your iPv4 Address (mines 192.168.1.114), and then save the changes… Example of how it should look:</p>
<p>Application Name       | Port        | Port          | Type         | iPv4 Here<br>
rsps                        | 43594      | 43594       | TCP          | Your iPv4 Address.</p>
<p>It’s not the best layout but just trying for a quick demonstration, now, after you do this, you still might not even be able too connect, lolwut? Head over to your Security tab and disable the Multiple Connection thing, you can disable all of them to be honest, as they probably cause more lag because they are blocking most of the incoming connections because it acts as a firewall. Now, even though your done with your router, you still probably can’t connect… da fawk!?</p>
<p>Go to your Windows Firewall/Whatever else you use… (Norton, AVG, MyMom, etc…) and make sure you are allowing incoming connections as well as that the ports are open within them. If you feel comfortable enough, you can just turn off your firewall. (That’s what I do, as I’m not really paranoid about someone going through ports on my computer, the most they can do is watch porn with me :P.) Anywho… this should mostly cover it… if still can’t connect, I’d be glad to get even more detailer… hope I helped thou  :rolleyes:</p>
