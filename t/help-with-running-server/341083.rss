              <p>I am pretty sure you can’t run your server while your laptop is shut. I don’t think their is a possibility of even running it while it is closed. What I would do is go into your settings, and make it so it doesn’t go to sleep or hibernate, and then run it and leave it open. This way your server won’t shut off. Or just do it on another computer.</p>
