    <description>ok in my server, lets say I have 1k noted manta rays, i put them in the bank, instead of turning into normal manta rays they stay in noted form, when I withdraw, still in noted form. How can I make it where when you deposit a noted item, it turns into its un-noted form in the bank and when you withdraw it?

P.S. My base is a palidino76</description>
