    <title>Programming physical objects, such as light-switches</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/programming-physical-objects-such-as-light-switches/408917</link>
    <description>I got to thinking... It would be pretty damned cool to write some kind of program or command for a light-switch so that you can dim it or turn it off and on through a button, or your phone or something... Would you have to make a chip for it? What do you have to do to put the information on that chip? I&#39;m kind of [i]stream-of-conscienceing[/i] all of this along with being a bit tipsy, but is there a way to write program on chips for such things as this? If anyone knows, the information would be both entertaining and helpful.</description>

could you use an arduino chip?</p>

I own one if these, and im tempted to build an automous mouse mover, so i can literally <em>bot</em> RS, i may have to make it work via RSBOT to get the nessicary data though, but if its a simple task like walking to a place, mining a rock, and banking, then it should be easy.<br>
Timing is the hard part xD</p>

              <p>in digital electronics we worked with basic logic gates most the time and later got to flip-flops and programmable logic devices. if you are interested in this stuff u can look into maybe an electronics hobby store or something. ik frys(on the website im just finding cds with info for IC chips but in store they had actual chips and stuff.) has electronic chips and stuff u can make little things and everything. but the PLDs we used some language similar to assembly, im not sure its been like 3 years since i was in that class. and the class before that we used this(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fischertechnik-GMBH-93293-ROBO-Interface/dp/B000WXD6VA" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.amazon.com/Fischertechnik-GMBH-93293-ROBO-Interface/dp/B000WXD6VA</a>) to make a marble sorting machine which used a flow chart type thing to program it.</p>
<p>as far as the light dimmer stuff they have opensource home automation software(e.g. <a href="http://www.linuxmce.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.linuxmce.org/</a>) that does what u were thinking. u just need to buy the hardware(e.g. this site has lots of that hardware: <a href="http://www.smarthome.com/_/index.aspx?src=WG1002329&amp;gclid=CLWw45Xav6oCFeoEQAodJks06Q" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.smarthome.com/_/index.aspx?src=WG1002329&amp;gclid=CLWw45Xav6oCFeoEQAodJks06Q</a>) to use it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>i think if u just wanted to do the light dimming thing u could just get a digital potentiometer and a PLD and have it change the amount of resistance based on the input going to the PLD. idk just ideas and info. the idea might have more stuff then that going on though <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> maybe find an electric engineer, or possibly a software(for the programming part) and hardware(obviously the hardware side of this subject) engineer, i think they would know about this stuff.</p>
