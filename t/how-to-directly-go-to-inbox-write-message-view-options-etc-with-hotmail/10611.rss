    <description> FOR HOTMAIL OR MSN EMAIL USERS

sometimes just checking the hotmail website to check your hotmail or msn email is quicker than opening your email client.. and this method is a sure-fire way to make checking your email very quick and easy.. i would suggest making a seperate folder in your bookmark list and add this links into that folder to make checking your multiple folders in hotmail very accessible with one single click.

FIRST go to hotmail.com and log in. make sure you set it to automatically sign you in.. (i guess only for ppl that have a computer all to themselves )

afterwards try going to this link

you might have to update your links every now and then but work fine for the most part..

[code]http://hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/HoTMaiL?[/code]

use this for your inbox

[code]http://hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/compose?[/code]

use this for &#39;compose message&#39;

[code]http://hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/options?[/code]

options of course

[code]http://hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/addresses?[/code]

contact list etc.

if you have customized folders you can link directly to those as well

just click on one of your custom folders and copy the url..

should look something like the following...


/http://hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/HoTMaiL?a=abcdefghijklmnop&amp;curmbox=F123456789

delete the &#39;yellow&#39; portion above to change the url into this...

CODE
http://hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/HoTMaiL?&amp;curmbox=F123456789

bookmark this link.

that should make your bookmark permanent with no &quot;RESEND POST DATA&quot; messages..

enjoy</description>
