    <title>Unexpected Response from Server. Help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unexpected-response-from-server-help/348614</link>
    <description>I had just had a problem in NPCSpawn.cfg, and I fixed it. But after i compiled that update, when I log in, I get a message says &quot;unexpected response from server&quot;.
In The run.cmd, it says that it&#39;s reviving connections from me. But it keeps saying Unexpected response from server.
The source I am using is Paladino76 based.
If you could, please send me a link to another 508 source.
thank you.</description>
