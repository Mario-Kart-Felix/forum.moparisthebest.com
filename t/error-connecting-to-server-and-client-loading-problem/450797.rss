    <description>Hey, for some reason, Yesterday I could connect to my server. yet today I can&#39;t.

I checked to see on canyouseeme.org to see if my port was open and this is what i got...

Error: I could not see your service on (My No-ip adress) on port (43594)
Reason: Connection refused

But i never changed anything... I did it fine yesterday, today It didn&#39;t work though.

Also, Second problem.

I compiled (this is when it worked) My client and server and sent it to my friend in a .rar (I uploaded it to mediafire or whatever)

when he tried to run it he got some error with Jframe or somthing. i can try and get it from him soon, but yea. I got it before, can&#39;t remember why or what happened to fix it. but im sure its common. It might have been possible he didn&#39;t extract it to his C: drive... ill have to check.</description>

<p>When i do the Open port check. it shows up as my no-Ip adress… but the port forwarding is set to my regular IP. is that a problem? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> can someone walk me through doing it again?</p>
