    <title>Dvorak keyboard layout</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dvorak-keyboard-layout/273584</link>
    <description>the &#39;normal&#39; qwerty layout that most people use only came into existance because old typewriter keys would jam, so the designers moved the keys further apart, to force people to slow down while typing.

the qwerty keyboard is designed to be inefficent.


dvorak is designed to be comfortable and fast, but because of the invisible hand of the market, its not very widely used.


what does mitb think of it?



iv got an old keyboard im going to modify to be the dvorak layout.

this site seems quite helpful about it [url=http://dvorak.mwbrooks.com/]http://dvorak.mwbrooks.com/[/url]</description>

That is even more of a reason to switch, if I didn’t know qwerty so well it would have been much easier to switch to dvorak.  But I’ve been using it for a year and it is the best. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>

<p>Most of the time you are on windows PC’s, which allow you to add another keyboard layout and change between them with ctrl+shift, a quicker way is using the program <a href="http://www.clabs.org/blogki/index.cgi?page=/ComputersAndTechnology/DvAssist" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">DVassist</a>, which is a very small tray utility that switches layouts for you.</p>
<p>It is also easy for anyone to change on a MAC as well, while of course everything is easy on linux. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>i dont get why everyone keeps talking about swapping the keys around physically on your keyboard. i managed to memorize all of the keys in about 3 days and i never had to change my qwerty keyboard, you also learn better if you dont look at the keyboard, and instead try to remember where that key is.</p>
<p>[quote=“Greeny, post:29, topic:273584”]Am I missing something? Those of your just changing your qwerty keyboards, (ie remapping them within your OS) you’re still using a qwerty keyboard so the argument the keys are more widely spaced apart is redundant.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure you just mean the keys are arranged better, either way the argument is redundant because I’d put a major bet on there being no health benefits, and the ideology that you can type faster kind of pathetic since in a working environment you have to stop to think anyway, whether it be professional writing or programming. It most certainly doesn’t matter for casual use.[/quote]<br>
what they mean by spaced out is that all of the most commonly used characters, in dvorak, are placed on the home row, so you dont have to move your fingers around as much when typing, as opposed to qwerty where everything is randomly placed and you have to move your fingers all over the keyboard</p>

The problem with some keyboards which prevents you from just “Swapping around” the keys is that the F and the J are different to other keys, so can’t be moved.<br>

When I typed in dvorak, I just had to turn those keys sideways so they would fit (I didn’t want to shave a little piece of plastic off of the post.)[/quote]</p>

<p>and it took an hour or two to memorize it, as well as learning to use all of my fingers. My typing is very slow but I’ve learned some good typing habits.[/quote]</p>
<p>That is neat, it is the same as a command line linux program I used to learn dvorak, dvorak7min, here is a screenshot I found on the net:</p>

<p>It took 4 minutes and 30 seconds to type that using dvorak, and I’m still quicker with 2 fingers using qwerty but I do like dvorak more. I think I’ll set a goal for myself, 50wpm using dvorak by the end of this month!</p>

<p>It is very entertaining and informative.</p>
<p>I’ve been using the dvorak layout for over a year, and switching from qwerty it took me about 2 weeks to get back up to the speed I could type at using a qwerty layout, since then I am now quite a bit faster than I was with qwerty.  However, for me speed was not the biggest advantage.  I found that after a day at the computer, either being on the forums, IRC, or programming (usually a combination of all three) that my fingers and sometimes wrists hurt and ached afterwards.  Going into a career as a computer scientist like that seemed like a bad idea, and I’m happy to say that ever since I changed to the dvorak layout my fingers or wrists have never hurt again, no matter how much I type.  That alone should be reason enough for anyone to switch.</p>
<p>As to having a different keyboard, or switching layouts on public computers, it isn’t a problem at all.  In the beginning I switched the layout on my laptop and an extra keyboard I had laying around to make it easier to learn, but now I never look anyway and so I type on qwerty keyboards all the time without problem.  As sppt said you can easily use <a href="http://www.clabs.org/blogki/index.cgi?page=/ComputersAndTechnology/DvAssist" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> to switch the layout on windows, or you can switch it easily with the regional and language settings in the control panel (even with restrictions, the language bar is never restricted).  On linux and mac it is easy to switch as well.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about it, feel free to ask me, I love talking about how great the dvorak layout is. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>I’m pretty sure you just mean the keys are arranged better, either way the argument is redundant because I’d put a major bet on there being no health benefits, and the ideology that you can type faster kind of pathetic since in a working environment you have to stop to think anyway, whether it be professional writing or programming. It most certainly doesn’t matter for casual use.</p>
