    <description>every time i try to mute some1 on my own server using &quot;report player&quot; for a test even if there online it will only say this player is offline and could not be muted help?


[code]
case 218: // Report Player
String receivedPlayerName = misc.longToPlayerName(inStream.readQWord()); 
int rule = inStream.readUnsignedByte();
int mute = inStream.readUnsignedByte();

try {
System.out.println(playerName+&quot; reported &quot;+receivedPlayerName);


/*if(PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(receivedPlayerName) == -1 &amp;&amp; mute == 1) {
sendMessage(receivedPlayerName+&quot; is offline and could not be muted&quot;);
}
else if(mute == 1 &amp;&amp; PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(receivedPlayerName) != -1 &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1) {
rp2.mutedate = lastlogintime;
rp2.muted = 1;
rp2.sendMessage(&quot;You have been muted for 48 hours by &quot;+playerName);
}*/
receivedPlayerName = receivedPlayerName.replaceAll(&quot;_&quot;, &quot; &quot;);

 if(mute == 1 &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt; 1) { // this means if they send fake packets to mute people they automatically become banned! rofl
  appendToBanned(playerName);
  disconnected = true;
 }

System.out.println(playerName+&quot; Reported player: &quot;+receivedPlayerName);
System.out.println(&quot;Rule = &quot;+rule);
System.out.println(&quot;Mute = &quot;+mute);
ReportAbuse(receivedPlayerName, rule, mute);

int PlayersIndex = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(receivedPlayerName);
client rp = (client) server.playerHandler.players[PlayersIndex];

if(PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(receivedPlayerName) == -1 &amp;&amp; mute == 1) {
sendMessage(receivedPlayerName+&quot; is offline and could not be muted&quot;);
}
else if(mute == 1 &amp;&amp; PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(receivedPlayerName) != -1 &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1) {
rp.mutedate = lastlogintime;
rp.muted = 1;
rp.sendMessage(&quot;You have been muted for 48 hours by &quot;+playerName);
}
}
catch(Exception e) {
sendMessage(receivedPlayerName+&quot; is offline and could not be muted&quot;);
}

break;[/code]
