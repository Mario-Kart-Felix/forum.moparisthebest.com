              <p>Well, the only include you should need is SRL. Just add</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">{.include SRL/SRL.scar}</code></pre>
<p>after your program line, and then if you want old scripts to work with randoms, just add this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">FindNormalRandoms;</code></pre>
<p>To various places in the script. That should find most of the randoms. If you need more help, ask.</p>
