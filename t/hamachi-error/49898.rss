    <title>Hamachi error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hamachi-error/49898</link>
    <description>Everytime I have hamachi on for an hour or less, it just keeps coming up with this error for no reason. Then I have to end up closing hamachi and restarting my server. It&#39;s getting very annoying and I don&#39;t see any reason for this error.

It says


&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Caramba

Hamachi failed to handle a critical error that has just occured and it needs to exit. An information about the error has been written into caramba.log file located in your Hamachi installation directory. Please forward this file to support@hamachi.cc so that we can track the problem down and fix it.

Please accept our apologizes for this embrassing incident[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
