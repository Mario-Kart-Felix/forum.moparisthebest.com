    <description>  Welcome to KKMC! We&#39;re an experienced (2 years old!) hardcore server with an interactive and friendly staff. We have a player cap of 64, and we&#39;re going to be 

expanding! We&#39;re looking for decent players to join our community.

	IP hcsmp.kkminecraft.net

    Features:

    1 LIFE ONLY - You die, you don&#39;t come back for 5 days!

    HardCore Environment! -- Set to the hardest settings, with pvp, griefing, and stealing allowed? Let&#39;s just say 70% of our players don&#39;t make it past the first day. 

But hey. why not try your luck and see if you can be better then the others!

    Events! -- We have automated and special events! We use the pvparena plugin, which means you can fight any person or group of people in head-to-head battle. There 

are several different pvp gametypes, ranging from Free-For-All to 4 Team Battles! Our special events are hosted by our admins, and often come with great prizes (such 

as enchanted weapons, or special perks). A short list of our events:
    -PvP Competitions
    -Faction Competitions
    -Juggernaut
    -Spleef
    -Capture the Flag
    -Siege (A custom gametype created by us!)
    -Hunger Games!
    -Factions

    Factions/Economy! -- Don&#39;t like playing alone? Perfect! Our server has factions and economy enabled. Meaning you can protect your land (at the risk of being found 

on the Dynamic Map), and you can go out to raid other factions. This is hardcore factions, so none of that peaceful garbage. You play strong or you find another 

server.

    Cheat Protection! -- Our staff is friendly and fair. We actively look for cheaters and ban them. Anyone killed by cheaters is revived as long as they fill out a 

ban appeal so we know what happened. As I said, we&#39;re a very friendly and interactive staff, we do a lot for our players!

    We&#39;re a very fair server and we don&#39;t play lightly, so it&#39;s recommended that you are decent survival player if you wish to join our community. But we&#39;re always 

very welcome to new players, and we&#39;ll help them in any way that&#39;s fair. We challenge you to prove your abilities.

	Rules :
No Mods and/or Hacks that are not aloud. (allowed, Rei&#39;s minimap unmodified, optifine, if unsure please ask the friendly admins)
No Spamming allowed, we have a plugin that will auto ban you if you spam.
PVP, Raiding, Griefing is allowed, do not bitch about getting griefed.
No asking for Items/Powers, We call this server Hardcore for a reason, you dont just type a few words and get full diamond and fly.
No joining factions and taking their items and then leaving / killing the members of your faction.
No inviting players to factions to just kill them.

	Tips
1) We are a Hardcore comunnity, Trusting others often resaults in your death, only trust Admins 100%. Other players will maybe offer helpful tips, donators = higher 

chance to trust
2) You start with a fishing rod, it is advised to use it.
3) you start with 100 Rupee&#39;s (in game currency) it is advised to not make a faction and actually use it at the shop to survive
4) dont build close to spawn, further you go out, less chance of getting griefed
5) pvp protection lasts 30minutes, protects against PVP, and PVE
6) collect wood around spawn and make stone tools.
7) Travel during the day and watch ur foot, plenty of holes to full into and die :(
8) Voting on PMC, Minestatus can give you 1 diamond a day, tell an admin when you vote. posting on minecraftforums gives 1 diamond a day, giving a Diamond on PMC also 

gives you 1 diamond.
9) so doing all 4 of the above gives you a total of 4 diamonds, that could be 1 diamond sword, and 2 spare with-in minutes :) helping you survive the crutial first 

24hours on the server :)
8) best of luck, hope to see you around :)
