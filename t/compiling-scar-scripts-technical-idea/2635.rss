    <title>Compiling SCAR scripts [Technical idea]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compiling-scar-scripts-technical-idea/2635</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been thinking about this concept and realised that I&#39;ve probably been thinking about it incorrectly. I&#39;ve been trying to think of a way to make something like this work:
[code]
PascalScript Executer Object -&gt; native, separate program
[/code]
But I doubt that is or ever will be possible without far more effort than I would want to put into it.

So I&#39;ve tried to think along the same lines as Kaitnieks might have.
1 - SCAR uses a 3rd party Pascal interpreter that could just as easily be used in any other program.
2 - I&#39;ve just finished a custom encryption protocol specifically for use with said interpreter in the context of SCAR
3 - I have access to all of my own function source, which could also be used in any other program.
4 - I already have a mechanism in place for evaluating scripts and doing something to them (certification).

Along those lines I&#39;ve come up with another idea - &#39;compile&#39; the scripts by means of a sort of mini-SCAR with the encrypted script hardcoded into the program. All Kaitnieks would have had to do is make a template for himself and copy + paste the script into a string when he was done certifying/encrypting it.

Of course, in order to make SCAR-lite someone would need to have all of the scripting functions from SCAR. I have an extremely old copy of the source, but it would be useless for this. Did Kaitnieks give anyone the most recent source before leaving?</description>

<p>I don’t think compilation would be mandatory just because it suddenly existed. If you find it convenient and it works for you, get a script compiled. Otherwise, SCAR as usual.</p>

              <p>Janilabo, my opinion is that people who don’t even have enough skill to know how to use Scar after reading the proper docs and tuts (and asking intelligent questions if need be) are likely to cause themselves more trouble than anything. Getting their mains banned very quickly comes to mind. It all ends in frustration and loss, and maybe having them become fierce anti-scripting fanatics who systematically report anything even remotely suspicious. So that’s not much of an argument for compilation.</p>
<p>I don’t think its worth the trouble to implement this, and it removes capability from the end user. Who’s not to say I would want to repair/update/customize a purchased script? Compiling removes that possibility. And I doubt it would do any good to stop those who would decide to delibaretely distribute “commercial” scripts. And has it even happened in all the time Scar’s been around?</p>

Maybe there is someone who would even have the source?

But there are still scripters who could trust to. And would be nice to make scripts for friends who don’t have SCAR or just are simply so stupid that they don’t even know how to use it =)</p>
