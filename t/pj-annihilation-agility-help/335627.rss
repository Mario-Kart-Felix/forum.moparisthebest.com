    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to put an animation to be different at each obstacle in PJ Annihilation, but I only got that it would not stop the animation after the obstacle! It just keeps running the animation even after the obstacle while walking!!

Anyone knowing how to make an animation show up just WHILE doing the obstacle??
I would be pleased! :D</description>
