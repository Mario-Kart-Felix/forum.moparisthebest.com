    <title>[718] Shop stock stays at 30?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-shop-stock-stays-at-30/513870</link>
    <description>I have a shop that has 36 items in it, but when I go to open it up, only the first 30 show up, making the other 6 not be there. I looked at my Shop.java and it says max stock is 40. I also looked all around ShopHandler.java and Shop.java to see if there was anything that might be making it not work, and haven&#39;t found anything. Normally I don&#39;t like asking for help, but this is something that I really need really bad, and can&#39;t figure out on my own, so can someone please help me?</description>

              <p>Well I’ve been on other servers and I’ve seen a few that have 40 items in their shops…</p>
<p>So it is possible to be done, but I don’t really need it now <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>I removed initiate, which cleared up 4 spaces, then I removed the kite for each armor, which cleared up 6 spaces.</p>
<p>And proselyte is an armor people wear to boost their prayer bonus.</p>

<p>How would I increase the interface limit if that’s the problem?[/quote]<br>
Well obiviously there is limit how much items can be in runescape shop, I don’t know how much it is but 30 would sound like it could be that. Even if server could handle more items than that 30 if interfaces was coded to only have 30 I don’t think you can use more than that 30. And ye like he said you don’t need bronze…</p>

              <p>Idea! How about just making a new shop?! That sounds brilliant!</p>
<p>You are probably not going to need bronze if you have iron. I don’t know what proselyte is, but it sounds like it doesn’t belong with just any armors.</p>
