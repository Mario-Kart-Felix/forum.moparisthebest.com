    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-livestream-summary-the-new-botnuke-read-if-you-have-any-questions/460303</link>
    <description>I&#39;m watching the recorded [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmMtcjXhSDQ&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=UUGpr8LIrdwrEak3GuZLQPwg]RS Livestream Q&amp;A[/url] from not long ago about the Botany Bay update (bot nuke), where they answer a lot of questions people are wondering about. I know a lot of people don&#39;t want to watch an hour and a half of video, so I&#39;m going to condense what I find to be the important points down into some simple things for people to read. Note that nothing I say will be direct quotes (while still said as if they were saying them), but the ideas are the same. I will try and underline important points that I think most people don&#39;t already know.

[i][b]How will you detect botters?[/b][/i]
[u]We have been running a learning system for about three months[/u] that learns gameplay patterns of legitimate players vs bots. This system will help us detect botters extremely quickly while leaving legitimate players untouched. IE - This system does not so much break bots as

[i][b]How will botters be punished?[/b][/i]
Most accounts caught botting will be given a three strike warning system. After their first catch, they will be given a temp ban and [u]certain gameplay restrictions to limit trading[/u] (to sell off botted items after being caught) and things like that. If they continue to bot after their first ban, they will be given a longer ban and the restrictions return. After this, any more times being caught results in a permanent ban, no matter what. [u]Botany bay does not change whether or not these accounts are banned, no matter the &#39;punishment&#39; people assign them there. Also note that accounts that were clearly made just to bot or goldfarm do not get any warnings and are perm banned on the first offense.[/u]

[i][b]When are these updates?[/b][/i]
[u]On the 17th (the day this was posted, Monday) the first batch of updates will go out, heavily detecting gold farmers and spammers. The following Monday (24th) the Botany Bay update will be released.
[/u]

[i][b]Do you realize this will hurt your income?[/b][/i]
Yes. We are not keeping bots around for money, we are doing this for the good of the game.

[i][b]Will people still need to report bots?[/b][/i]
Absolutely! We view reports on a heatmap based on where they were sent from, so if we get a lot of reports in one area it means we may need to update our detection software in that place to combat the updated bots.


[i][b]Do you expect any adverse effects?[/b][/i]
We expect an increase of hacking and phishing, because gold farming websites that were getting their gold that way will be desperate for new measures. This is part of the reason we recently released JAG (Jagex Account Guardian) as well, to prepare people for this. We also expect the economy to take a while to adapt.


[i][b]What will happen to items that are on perm banned accounts? Both low profile (chinchompas, dragon bones, etc) and high profile (rares)?[/b][/i]
All lower profile items will be removed with the account, no exceptions.[u] If an account has a lot of high profile items that would heavily effect the economy if they were removed, the items [i]may[/i] be reintroduced by putting them on the grand exchange.[/u]

[i][b]What happened to Optimus?[/b][/i]
[u]Optimus will be put in place the same time as Botany Bay, but it isn&#39;t the prominent update and is just behind the scenes.[/u] We expect this to have a similar effect to the original bot nuke, breaking 98% of the bots, with the other 2% being detected by Botany Bay. If the other 98% fix themselves, we except Botany Bay to detect them too.

[i][b]What is your stance on gambling?[/b][/i]
[u]We have nothing against gambling as a whole, we understand that there is a love of high risk gameplay. However, we do have things against spamming, RTW, and scamming, which all seem to be linked to it. We think it&#39;s better to create ways people can gamble safely rather than remove gambling as a whole. We are also working on removing or muting people that spam.[/u]

[i][b]Are you working on taking down bot sites, not just botting programs?[/b][/i]
[u]With the release of Optimus and Botany Bay, we plan on furthering both our civil and criminal charges against the makers of Powerbot and Epicbot with our lawyers.[/u] (I personally found this one very interesting, wonder how it will pan out)

[b][i]Will you be releasing the names of people that are banned for others to use?[/i][/b]
[size=18pt][u][i][b]Yes.[/b][/i][/u][/size] THIS IS HUGE!

[b][i]Will members have more warnings or be less likely to be banned?[/i][/b]
Absolutely not.

[b][i]What will happen to people that botted before the update?[/i][/b]
[u]The goal of Botany Bay is to stop people from botting. If we do this, our job is complete.[/u] (Basically means [eople should not expect to be punished for botting before the update)

[b][i]Is there a way to re-introduce the old dangerous random events now that you can more accuraly detect botting?[/i][/b]
(around the 1:19:00 hour mark, I highly suggest watching this)
[size=18pt][b]HUGE REVEAL, ONLY IN THE LIVESTREAM:[/b][/size] [u]We plan on removing the anti-macroing events, while still having their personalities in the game, such as court cases. We understand a lot of experienced users like them for the rewards, but we introduced them to take care of bots and they can be very confusing for new players.[/u]

<p>Indeed.

They also emphasize how fast their system can detect botters, so botting skills wouldn’t be worth it.</p>
<p>Also I understand that a lot of this may not be clear if you didn’t watch the stream, so I’ll try to clarify or answer any questions I can <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> It’s hard to fit an hour and a half of video into a few paragraphs!</p>

              <p>I’m watching the recorded <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmMtcjXhSDQ&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=UUGpr8LIrdwrEak3GuZLQPwg" data-bbcode="true">RS Livestream Q&amp;A</a> from not long ago about the Botany Bay update (bot nuke), where they answer a lot of questions people are wondering about. I know a lot of people don’t want to watch an hour and a half of video, so I’m going to condense what I find to be the important points down into some simple things for people to read. Note that nothing I say will be direct quotes (while still said as if they were saying them), but the ideas are the same. I will try and underline important points that I think most people don’t already know.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">How will you detect botters?</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">We have been running a learning system for about three months</span> that learns gameplay patterns of legitimate players vs bots. This system will help us detect botters extremely quickly while leaving legitimate players untouched. IE - This system does not so much break bots as</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">How will botters be punished?</span></span><br>
Most accounts caught botting will be given a three strike warning system. After their first catch, they will be given a temp ban and <span class="bbcode-u">certain gameplay restrictions to limit trading</span> (to sell off botted items after being caught) and things like that. If they continue to bot after their first ban, they will be given a longer ban and the restrictions return. After this, any more times being caught results in a permanent ban, no matter what. <span class="bbcode-u">Botany bay does not change whether or not these accounts are banned, no matter the ‘punishment’ people assign them there. Also note that accounts that were clearly made just to bot or goldfarm do not get any warnings and are perm banned on the first offense.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">When are these updates?</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">On the 17th (the day this was posted, Monday) the first batch of updates will go out, heavily detecting gold farmers and spammers. The following Monday (24th) the Botany Bay update will be released.<br>
</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Do you realize this will hurt your income?</span></span><br>
Yes. We are not keeping bots around for money, we are doing this for the good of the game.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Will people still need to report bots?</span></span><br>
Absolutely! We view reports on a heatmap based on where they were sent from, so if we get a lot of reports in one area it means we may need to update our detection software in that place to combat the updated bots.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Do you expect any adverse effects?</span></span><br>
We expect an increase of hacking and phishing, because gold farming websites that were getting their gold that way will be desperate for new measures. This is part of the reason we recently released JAG (Jagex Account Guardian) as well, to prepare people for this. We also expect the economy to take a while to adapt.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">What will happen to items that are on perm banned accounts? Both low profile (chinchompas, dragon bones, etc) and high profile (rares)?</span></span><br>
All lower profile items will be removed with the account, no exceptions.<span class="bbcode-u"> If an account has a lot of high profile items that would heavily effect the economy if they were removed, the items <span class="bbcode-i">may</span> be reintroduced by putting them on the grand exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">What happened to Optimus?</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Optimus will be put in place the same time as Botany Bay, but it isn’t the prominent update and is just behind the scenes.</span> We expect this to have a similar effect to the original bot nuke, breaking 98% of the bots, with the other 2% being detected by Botany Bay. If the other 98% fix themselves, we except Botany Bay to detect them too.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">What is your stance on gambling?</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">We have nothing against gambling as a whole, we understand that there is a love of high risk gameplay. However, we do have things against spamming, RTW, and scamming, which all seem to be linked to it. We think it’s better to create ways people can gamble safely rather than remove gambling as a whole. We are also working on removing or muting people that spam.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Are you working on taking down bot sites, not just botting programs?</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">With the release of Optimus and Botany Bay, we plan on furthering both our civil and criminal charges against the makers of Powerbot and Epicbot with our lawyers.</span> (I personally found this one very interesting, wonder how it will pan out)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Will you be releasing the names of people that are banned for others to use?</span></span><br>
[size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Yes.</span></span></span>[/size] THIS IS HUGE!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Will members have more warnings or be less likely to be banned?</span></span><br>
Absolutely not.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">What will happen to people that botted before the update?</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">The goal of Botany Bay is to stop people from botting. If we do this, our job is complete.</span> (Basically means [eople should not expect to be punished for botting before the update)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Is there a way to re-introduce the old dangerous random events now that you can more accuraly detect botting?</span></span><br>
(around the 1:19:00 hour mark, I highly suggest watching this)<br>
[size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-b">HUGE REVEAL, ONLY IN THE LIVESTREAM:</span>[/size] <span class="bbcode-u">We plan on removing the anti-macroing events, while still having their personalities in the game, such as court cases. We understand a lot of experienced users like them for the rewards, but we introduced them to take care of bots and they can be very confusing for new players.</span></p>
