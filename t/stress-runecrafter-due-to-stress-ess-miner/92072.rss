    <title>Stress RuneCrafter (due to Stress Ess Miner)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stress-runecrafter-due-to-stress-ess-miner/92072</link>
    <description>Okay, I&#39;m almost 100% sure that there are no [u][size=16pt]SRL Developers[/size][/u] that actually take a look at these.
But just in case if you guys are...

The amount of Pure Ess has gone up by the 100&#39;s of K&#39;s, and nobody can buy these.
In other words, [size=16pt][b]Supply[/b][/size] is at an all time high, while the [b][size=16pt]Demand[/size][/b] is close to nothing now.

So, we need something to do with all of these that we&#39;ve collected.
To RuneCraft ourselves is the only solution.

I&#39;ve been working on one myself, but I don&#39;t have SRL access, the correct experience, or even the time to make one myself.

I&#39;m sure that any of you developers could make tons of GP, USD, or whatever currency off of this possibility.
If SRL is hiding one that already works, then PLEASE sell it to the leechers of the RuneScape community.

Please at least post if you read this request.</description>

<p>uhhh, yea, thanks a lot.<br>
I’ve started to get into the merchant worlds and forums lately…<br>
the demand is higher than I thought.<br>
So, it really isn’t THAT hard to sell the ess.<br>
But I wouldn’t mind spending the cash on a new RC script.<br>

              <p>[quote=“Starblaster100, post:2, topic:92072”]basically you want a runecrafter?<br>
for Air, water, fire…?[/quote]</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, it doesn’t matter to me.<br>
I think fire would not only be best for experience,<br>
but probably easiest to make.<br>
The easiest thing to do is to also just require a Tiara to be equiped.<br>
You could just add that fact to the Instructions.<br>
Thanks for checkin it out, Star.</p>
<p>[quote=“The Un-Named, post:3, topic:92072”]…me and Ejjman1 are working on a pay script that crafts free runes. (Air, fire, mind, earth, water and soon body).</p>
<p>Any ways, the demand for ess has always been low, just keep it for a later date or sell it.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s a good idea that you guys are working on that,<br>
especially if you have the choice between each of those.<br>
and thanks for the tip on the ess I currently have, guess I’ll just keep it all for a while.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Thanks for posting, Staff.</span></p>
