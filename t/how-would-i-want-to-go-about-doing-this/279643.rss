    <title>How would I want to go about doing this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-want-to-go-about-doing-this/279643</link>
    <description>I am adding a area on my website where users can ask me a question by using a form on one of my pages, but first I have to validate it.

The best way I can think about doing this is the following

User submits question
It goes into my mysql table
By default a column name valid is set to false
I will have a section in my control panel where all of these posts are displayed and I can click something that will change false to true
On the question and answers page it will show only posts that have validate set to true.

Any other ideas on how I would want to go about doing this[br][br][size=1]Posted on: May 21, 2009, 05:12:14 pm[/size][hr]Well im almost done now anyways so I just did it the way I wanted to.</description>
