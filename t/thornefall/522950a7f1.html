If the project was no longer driven by his passion and he didn’t find much worth in what the project was adding to his skills, why would he continue?</p>
<p>This all seems to be lost now every 14 year old wants to bring in the $$ with their stolen private server. Or people like Limits who post terrible graphics so they can feel better about their genital size, without showing source code or wanting to take advice. Props to Sini for sticking out for as long as he did because I would have left it long ago. It’s a boring game with a now terrible community.</p>
<p>Think you can do better? Well go contribute to the project yourself instead of complaining about people who actually did give a little bit of themselves to bring you your content.[/quote]</p>

        <p>The news about Thornefall was never supposed to come out. And frankly you know either way I don’t think it mattered except for the fact I wanted to respect Taharok 's wishes. I think none of you realize, and me especially before this point, the passion and drive it takes to be self motivated to make a game. Taharok inspires me everytime we have a meeting about Thornefall and it inspires a feeling of pride I haven’t felt since I started programming. He’s an amazing mentor and leader. I have trouble being self motivated because most of the time with any of my projects I had an interest in learning. I felt I learned as much as I could from rs emulation and frankly, please everyone who does rs emulation know that it is a dead end. However it’s not a dead end in your journey of being a developer. It’s just stepping stone, and that’s all it ever was. Working alongside the team has given me an environment in which I can improve my skills, and get good peer criticism in a constructive environment. It’s awesome. I wish I could go more into detail about exacts but I have created a few pieces of code I’m very proud of so far. So I think anymore if you want to poke and say that I never succeeded I think you just need to rethink your perspective of success. Success isn’t binary in nature.</p>
<p>Being apart of this team has renewed my confidence as a developer. I feel able to do anything as long as I put a logical backdrop behind the process. I don’t have to figure it out all on my own too, I have 3 talented members to help and I know for some I am also a resource for them. It’s a huge shift in my perspective where I’d feel inclined to try and do everything myself because I didn’t trust other people. I needed it.</p>
<p>I can’t wait for the team to show you all what we are capable of. It’s going to be awesome. I know that we want to create new fond memories for teenagers of the current generation. I think we will succeed. And with that, I think that sums up my perspective.</p>

        <p>[quote=“sini, post:260, topic:522950”]I will respond. Tree. Im touched. Seriously. Thanks for that post.[/quote]I basically stated the same thing, I for real applaud you for going as long as you did. All you hating on Sini have no clue about the real world. Do you people realize how many people are working jobs they have absolutely no passion for? You do what you are passionate for, and good results will come. If you are wasting your time in a hobby or job where you aren’t progressing, you need to reevaluate what you’re doing.</p>
<p>To add, I wouldn’t be surprised if Sini lost interest months ago but felt obligated to keep going.</p>

<p>I’m not its the truth, provide something you have actually finished? Everything that I have seen goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>start a project</li>
<li>work hard on it yay!</li>
<li>show some progress</li>
<li>do a side project (this is where things go down hill)</li>
<li>decide to quit the project / rewrite the project</li>
<li>repeat</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you can say its due to interest changes or whatever reason but to me it really shows you have some serious project management issues, Yeah you can program but you can’t manage your projects for shit and I hope for this project they keep you straight on the code and out of the management because if they don’t we are going to see the same results as what I posted above. It’s nothing against you or your ability as a programmer but big companies higher project managers to keep the programmers on a focused task for a reason</p>

        <p>I think a lot of that boils down into my methodology. Learning the process of writing code, writing tests, pulling, reviewing, re-reviewing is a god send to keeping things on track. Doing that by yourself is difficult and I feel objectively its hard to keep track of everything you have to do by yourself.</p>
<p>It’s like if you have to design a soda machine, sure. You can make a soda machine. However if you’re doing it by yourself, you might just create a little machine that dispenses cups, fills the cup with water, adds flavor. Your customers are the people who challenge what you release to them, and if it fits their needs they won’t complain. You may have used gum to keep the pieces together but they don’t care, as long as it works. However, everyone else in the business knows gum is a ridiculous method to keep the pieces together and everyone uses glue. However, you’d have to research into using glue and maybe you’d have to redesign your machine all together. That’s often what happened. In a team environment say, one guy likes using gum, and another guy used glue before so he makes a good case about using glue instead of gum. Your team uses glue, and your machine is less prone to falling apart.</p>
<p>I tried to use the community as an outlet for this purpose a lot of the times but most of the time I’d find that I was the expert on the things I was asking about, and not an expert of the subject but rather the local expert that people would go to ask questions about. That’s the point in time you need to molt.</p>
<p>You don’t know what projects I’ve ran outside of RSPS. I managed the programming side of a robotics team at one point in time, efficiently as possible? No. However we were always the team that had our work done on time. We always had stretch goals finished. Does it matter in the grand scheme of things? I guess not. But just because I guess people are so interested in what I’m doing I guess I could bring in that note.</p>
<p>Putting the responsibility of designing a game on a single person is a huge undertaking especially considering I feel as if I did do a good job and what I did put out was good quality. There were HUGE gaps in my understanding and I never felt like hacking in features was the right way to go about things. My frustration in the Mopar project stemmed from my inability to know how to properly set up the design around what Jagex put forward. I have joint creative control now around a lot of these topics in Thornefall and it feels like coming out of a hyperbolic chamber. The environment RSPS puts you in is more challenging than people would expect because not only do you have to think like a game developer you have to think similarly to how Jagex designed their game. Trying to design your own systems to work with their game client is too time consuming.</p>
<p>A lot of my time committed to the community was driven to try and push the community further, the passion died a year ago when RS programming outgrew me and the experience were more or less a time crunch because people would constantly berate me like you have for as long as I can remember. I honestly just wanted to be remembered in a positive light. Now I realize what was done here doesn’t mean absolutely fuck all considering I used Jagex’s game for 95% of what I called my own work and that’s not a legacy I want associated with me. It was a stepping stone.</p>
<p>These comments are getting annoying. Putting someone into a mold and saying that they can’t do something because you have some inclination to say you understand me as a person, is annoying. I don’t know much about you Silab but beyond what you did years ago, what platform do you have to criticize people on?</p>
<p>I feel like I have to explain my story about this a lot. And you can have whatever opinion. Just please take away from my post that it’s harder than it looks on the surface. I’m trying really hard to improve as a developer, and as a person who has trouble staying not frustrated with some of the more intimidating challenges. But people have issues with selectively reading, and not really empathizing with these points. I wasn’t angry writing this post I think at this point I’m just frustrated. So please don’t think my voice in this piece meant that. I respect you a lot, I think you’re right in some ways, and I am going to improve moving forward. Thanks.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if Sini does not drop this project in a few days or want to rewrite it 3 or 4 times.</p>

</aside>
<p>You’re so mean. Like why.</p>
<p>Pretty much the process so far has been similar to rewriting. Not exactly. But there’s a lot of restructuring and reevaluation of ideas. So I guess you got that part correct. The race starts today. Gonna be busy.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not its the truth, provide something you have actually finished? Everything that I have seen goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>start a project</li>
<li>work hard on it yay!</li>
<li>show some progress</li>
<li>do a side project (this is where things go down hill)</li>
<li>decide to quit the project / rewrite the project</li>
<li>repeat</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you can say its due to interest changes or whatever reason but to me it really shows you have some serious project management issues, Yeah you can program but you can’t manage your projects for shit and I hope for this project they keep you straight on the code and out of the management because if they don’t we are going to see the same results as what I posted above. It’s nothing against you or your ability as a programmer but big companies higher project managers to keep the programmers on a focused task for a reason[/quote]</p>

You people forget that this community was built by people wanting to develop because they were passionate about what we were doing here. They also wanted to experiment and try to better themselves.

<p>Think you can do better? Well go contribute to the project yourself instead of complaining about people who actually did give a little bit of themselves to bring you your content.[/quote]</p>
<p>Just because he’s contributed a little bit to the community doesn’t mean he can’t be criticized. What I classify a capable developer as is someone who can consistently finish a project they start. How this community came about is irrelevant. You’re just using it as an excuse for your butt buddy quitting a project he should’ve never taken on in the first place. It honestly sounds like he just got a little overwhelmed and instead of working through it he just quit and threw the project into someone else’s hands. I want to know if this would even be a problem if Thornefall didn’t exist. My guess is it would be the same shit but a different story.</p>

        <p>To be honest Sini, when you mention your robotics and how you used to finish everything on time, I think I have figured the problem of “time management” you seem to have in this community. The problem is not your capability,the problem is that there are no set dates for you,so you just continue to optimize. In those robotics competitions,you have set time frames. Here,you are just told to do something,you figure out the rest. Set some dates for your projects, it also excites your hype to that set date. It’s win win for you guys and your following. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I agree with sini on this… and it might as well be dead its old. I am surprised people still mess with this stuff I think its a good start so you get a feel of things programming-wise but after that there’s no more progressing you have to eventually move on to something more. Start creating your own stuff. I don’t get why this is all a big deal. Why not just support him and his decision to move onto Thornefall. I’d rather see Thornefall progress and become the next big thing then another stupid ass RSPS.</p>

        <p>[quote=“arham 4, post:275, topic:522950”]To be honest Sini, when you mention your robotics and how you used to finish everything on time, I think I have figured the problem of “time management” you seem to have in this community. The problem is not your capability,the problem is that there are no set dates for you,so you just continue to optimize. In those robotics competitions,you have set time frames. Here,you are just told to do something,you figure out the rest. Set some dates for your projects, it also excites your hype to that set date. It’s win win for you guys and your following. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
