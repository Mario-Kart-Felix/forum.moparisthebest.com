[s]A few buddies of mine[/s] Myself and a few people are working on this game. It&#39;s been a long-time in the development process and they&#39;re making some pretty awesome progress. I figured I&#39;d post it here for them because it seems to run pretty close to home, here. ;) I&#39;d hope you guys would be interested in contributing. :D

Their material is a bit limited at the moment, but their passion seems legit and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll add more as they can. Seems pretty cool. I&#39;m definitely going to register.

Note: this is not a private server. Everything here was made from scratch, including the engine and tools.

              <p>I agree with Vain_ for once, this thread clearly doesn’t belong in the Games section if everything that has been posted about it so far is outdated and there’s no other current information about it to discuss. If the game, at some point in the future, is getting ready for or is already in a playable state, we can unlock this thread or you can create a new one. If you want to create a thread to post in-development updates and things of that sort, create a thread in the Game Development section.</p>

              <p>No. If Taharok wants to post any updates, he will. But I don’t think he visits here often so. Honestly, it does bother me a bit that people say that we are ripping from a game when in reality the games look similar. But I’m not really worried that will be the final product, but everyone else doesn’t know that. So you guys will have to be patient.</p>

To be honest Sini, when you mention your robotics and how you used to finish everything on time, I think I have figured the problem of “time management” you seem to have in this community. The problem is not your capability,the problem is that there are no set dates for you,so you just continue to optimize. In those robotics competitions,you have set time frames. Here,you are just told to do something,you figure out the rest. Set some dates for your projects, it also excites your hype to that set date. It’s win win for you guys and your following. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I don’t hold a single bit of negativity to you Sini, just do your thang.<br>

<p>Schedules are nice. We do have one for thornefall.[/quote]<br>
Direct your hype towards that (I.e. put it on the thread)</p>

that was almost 3 years ago and nearly the entire scope has changed from what I’ve kept up with.

Obviously yea, from what you see it is a clone. Calmly saying it’s too early to judge is not getting mad. But Sini is right in saying no one is making an effort to think ahead like “hey, maybe they’ll switch it up and do their own thing.” [/quote]Yeah, and maybe they’ll turn it into a tile based MOBA with space dinosaurs, blackjack, and hookers. That doesn’t even mean it will be better. It’s ridiculous to tell people to look ahead without giving any sort of conceptual frame of reference. What does “look ahead” mean? We have no idea what could change and what the plan of the game is. The ONLY thing people have to look at is what has been posted, so that’s what people post about. If they can’t handle that and don’t want to give more information, don’t pussy out and just tell people to use their imagination and pretend like the game is going in the right direction. What the f<span class="bbcode-u"></span>uck is that? That’s like Limits-level bullshit right there. “Look at my car game guys! Dont post about how it looks right now though, I promise its going to end up better than the NASCAR games”[/quote]<br>

<p>I don’t think the genre is dead. I think the genre hasn’t seen a lot of good new titles in quite some time though. I think the ideas have been reused too much and something fresh could be popular. Even if its not the biggest game ever the engine and other tools we’re writing are very valuable.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">How is Thornefall fresh?</span> Pretty sure everyone can see the obvious similarities to RuneScape…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s like saying soda and water are the same, because they are both wet. There’s a lot more that goes into the design. Same with Frell’s game. Guns of icarus on boats, some would say. I don’t think people have enough information, right now, to make that assumption but the common trend for people to judge is to spend about 5 seconds of thought. Internally there are a lot of mechanics I think that will be unique, or we have discussed about that we’re hoping to try and integrate it into the game to make it unique. The important pieces in my mind are the tools we create. Those aren’t specifically for Thornefall, and are vastly useful in a wide range of scenarios.[/quote]</p>
<p>No it’s not. Probably more like saying Coke and Pepsi are the same. They look identical but taste a little different. Of course I’m going to judge on what I see. How do I know what the game is supposed to look like. You’re all talk and no action.</p>
<p>Even if you change the mechanics and put in some unique shit any rs player will think “wow a runescape rip off” just because the looks.</p>
