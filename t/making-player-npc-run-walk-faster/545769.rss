<p>Perhaps its because the carpet moves in a different way. Your player is very flexible, but the carpet cannot go diagonally. I wonder why…</p>

<p>doesn’t really explain why it moves faster, not sure if that isn’t just the client trying to “correct” the position by speeding up the player, like when you lag and people who were walking begin running</p>

Agreed entirely. Its actually more noticeable now. In RS3 (basically anything 562 too), when its loading the screen, you can see the men and women running (with the run animation).</p>

<p>The reason its like this is because of how the map works. The player is ALWAYS on a tile, never in between. When it looks like you are walking, your position in the client is actually on the next tile, its just there’s a flag that says ‘ok we are walking we should draw the player between the tiles not the tile they are actually on’. So your speed is indicated in ‘tiles per tick’ with walking be 1 and running being 2. You can’t move half a tile, or any other fraction, so you cannot increase the speed unless you want walking to be 2 and running to be 3. 3 might be the speed of carpets, I’d have to take a look at the player updating client-sided again to see if it is that simple or if its handled different like Death Style said.</p>

</aside>
<p>alright so if it works with the example you said tiles per tick would this be a server sided thing for me to change or on the client sided, and if so would it be as simple as just changing a 1 to a 3 or would it be more difficult than that<br>
[/quote]That is a crazy speed, and no it wouldn’t be that simple. You would have to change your player updating, and possibly the client sided player updating depending on whether or not it supports the 3 tiles per tick speed (based on what Death Style is saying it may not)[/quote]</p>
<p>so what hes saying is it would move from x=1000 to x=1003 then x=1006 and so on and have an animation that makes it seem as if the player is really moving that fast? because if so how would that work because wouldnt the animation restart once the player is moved</p>
