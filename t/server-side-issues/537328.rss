    <title>Server Side Issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-side-issues/537328</link>
    <description>Am having troubles with a Runescape private server, the server was released with an anti leach. Need a little assistance with the anti leach.

I plan on using the server for playing with friends, should be a fun past time.

I know the basics when it comes to programming, and I think I can figure out what does what pretty easily. I have a little experience with C/C++

The problem I am having is a connection problem, the server disconnects the client because the client is seen as being &quot;Null&quot;. I am pretty sure I know where the block of code that is doing this is located, but I do not know what the original/fixed block should look like.

I am pretty sure this is server sided mainly because the refusal of the client is happening on the servers side and the server is calling the client &quot;Null&quot;. Can only find where the server calls the client null, no where can I find the Client claiming to be null.

You can download the files from here [url=http://uppit.com/bzipad0j2hb4/January15al.rar]http://uppit.com/bzipad0j2hb4/January15al.rar[/url]   [url=https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/efda4d30f49d546ade18c6650c07c8a135bd5baae94c38ab4b0dd8470ff7d612/analysis/1387581099/]Virus Scan[/url]

So would it be the clienthandler calling it null, and disconnecting? I am looking around now.




---------------------EDIT---------------------------&#39;

Now I am looing at the client.java in the server files, Looking around for the clienthandler.</description>
