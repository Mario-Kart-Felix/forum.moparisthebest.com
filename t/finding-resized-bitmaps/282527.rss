    <title>Finding resized bitmaps</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/finding-resized-bitmaps/282527</link>
    <description>Hi I&#39;m completly new to SCAR and I&#39;m finding it quite a useful programming tool, however I&#39;m now stuck with something.

I want to search for a bitmap which could be of a different size, up to 50% smaller but never bigger. Is there a function which can do this? I&#39;ve got a copy of the manual I printed in 2007 [but never used] and I can&#39;t really find this function, unless I&#39;m misinterpreting the definitions.

I&#39;ve tried FindDeformedBitmapToleranceIn() but I don&#39;t think this can check images with 50% size difference.

Thanks for your support,

              <p>I made this but strangely it doesn’t work &gt;_&lt;.<br>
Might have to enable API calls and use BitBlt</p>
<p><code>procedure ResizeBitmap(var BMP: Integer; Width, Height: Integer);
var
  Buffer: TBitmap;
  W, H: Integer;
begin
  Buffer := TBitmap.Create;
  GetBitmapSize(BMP, W, H);
  SafeDrawBitmap(BMP, Buffer.Canvas, 0, 0);
  FreeBitmap(BMP);
  BMP := BitmapFromString(Width, Height, '');
  SafeCopyCanvas(Buffer.Canvas, GetDebugCanvas, 0, 0, W, H, 0, 0, Width, Height);
  Buffer.Free;
end;</code></p>
<p>The only problem with this is that when you resize you will lose data so you’ll probably still need to use the deformed search and note that this is not going to work to make it larger only scaling down.</p>
