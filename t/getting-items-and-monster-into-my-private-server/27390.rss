    <title>Getting items and monster into my Private Server!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-items-and-monster-into-my-private-server/27390</link>
    <description>Okay...I set up my server but i dont know how to edit it, i would like to know how to get monster and items ect. and also the ::char option to change my characters look, and I would really like to know how to make myself a mod and how to edit my stats! Also i tried to open autospawn.cfg and i dont know what program to open it with.

And if anyone has any cool things that i could add to my server, i would gladly appreciate it, and if you could tell me how to do it, it would be even better thanks =)

You can add me on msn ( for_sale200@hotmail.com ) or just post here.


Thank you!!</description>
