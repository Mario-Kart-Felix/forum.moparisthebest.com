        <p>Wisdom is a RuneSource project that i just started roughly a week ago. After fixing things up i figured i would start a development showoff to keep track of everything. There were many things already in the source, and many things are also partially coded, so i’m only going to introduce the things i have do so far as well as main features. But for my first time coding RuneSource, as well as it being week 1, i feel like i’m at a good spot. (oh it was also a “mainly pvp” project, im slowly turning it into economy <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> )</p>
