    <title>Wisdom - Where Oldschool Meets Newschool</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wisdom-where-oldschool-meets-newschool/553240</link>
    <description>Wisdom is a RuneSource project that i just started roughly a week ago. After fixing things up i figured i would start a development showoff to keep track of everything. There were many things already in the source, and many things are also partially coded, so i&#39;m only going to introduce the things i have do so far as well as main features. But for my first time coding RuneSource, as well as it being week 1, i feel like i&#39;m at a good spot. (oh it was also a &quot;mainly pvp&quot; project, im slowly turning it into economy :) )


[size=24pt]Things already accomplished[/size]
Option on what graphics/animations you use when client is loaded, (474 or 602) 
Finished adding in dragon claws special, (wouldn&#39;t say its perfect, but its gotta be close)
added in a Recent updates interface
made kalphite queen accessible, as well as making it a multi zone.
made KBD accessible
coded doors in the &quot;maze&quot; random event, and put nomad in the center, as well as making the center a multi zone.
added npcs to home to make playing more convenient for my friends who are on the server helping me find bugs and adding suggestions
fixed lunar home teleport
changeable client theme (will all pictures for all themes later)

[size=24pt]Bugs i have found and will fix[/size]
when completing RFD, quest doesn&#39;t save, and must re-complete after logging out
Firemaking object isnt animated, only on the 474 side of the game (if you know a fix please enlighten me)
there are others i just cant remember right now...  :palm:


[size=24pt]Things i plan on adding/finishing[/size]
DwarfMultiCannon (placeable, doesn&#39;t shoot)
adding RSA (please help :( lol... i&#39;m having a hard time with this server sided )


[size=24pt]if anyone has any knowledge of coding RSA server sided, please enlighten me.[/size]

i have done more, but its getting late and i need to go to sleep :) thread will be updated tomorrow.
