    <description>Warning:I am very new to coding and such. File names confuse me easily if not very specific.


Problem: I have my server and everything online, but my friends can&#39;t seem to connect. I know I have everything on my side in order, but what is it that my friends would need to download in order to play on my server (online)? I know they need Hamachi, so don&#39;t add that.</description>
