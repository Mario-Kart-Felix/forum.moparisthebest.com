    <title>Cant share my rsps?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-share-my-rsps/544734</link>
    <description>Ok, So I have some questions. First I have set up portforwarding and how do I share my rsps after portforwarding? I already set everything to my no-ip and I put my client drop box and gave it to a friend. Then after he got it I ran my server and he started the client but it wouldnt load anything else. It just said loading 0%. So then I tried giving him my source also and that just gave him errors because like error! &quot;main&quot; something like that. This is in the same house. So what im trying to say is how do I share my rsps? Everywhere I see they all say portforward and then your friends can join, but they dont add the step on how to join it -_-. If I sound dumb or anything its because I just started doing this yesterday.</description>

Hello! If I'm not horribly mistaken, the client's Client.java/Client.class-file contains the IP-address of the server it's going to look for.
<p>Portforwarding should only be necessary when clients are going to access you’r server from outside it’s LAN (WAN), where the Socket-connection<br>
needs to know wich port it shall try to connect trough.</p>
<p>Do you know how you’r server is accepting incoming Socket-connections?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>ummmm, im sorry but cant find any ip in client.java and there is no client.class file for my source or client. Sorry again but I dont know what a socket connection is. Also do I just make a client.jar and send it in drop box because I did that and it didnt load, it kept saying loading 0%. Thx for responding!<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Hmmm… Just exactly wich RSPS-revision are we talking about?<br>
For the moment I’m deeply concentrated in my 317 project.</p>
<p>Could you enter you’r source, open up “Server.java” and copy/paste it’s “run”-method in a new comment below?<br>
Most RSPS are making connections to their clients in this method.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>What do you mean? I searched and there is no server.java, the only thing that shows is server channel handler. Im making a 712+ rsps<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Strange… Do you know wich class contains you’r server’s main-method?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>thx for helping but im uninterested in making a rsps now <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

<p>OH - That’s unfortunate! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
How ever, if you ever want to create an RSPS again, perhaps you should try a lower revision. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
