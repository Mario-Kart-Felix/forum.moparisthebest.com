    <title>Why is RSCPS Dead?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-is-rscps-dead/317378</link>
    <description>VPS are too expensive? 
VPS are hard to use?
VPS are shit?
Don&#39;t know how to set up a server? 
Don&#39;t know how to code?
Don&#39;t know what the fuck you are doing?

At Cheap-VPS.Sytes.Net, we offer very cheap VPS but very good servers, starting from $5, with both Operating Systems Linux &amp; Windows, we will also do all the administrative work for you for absolutely free (if you want us to), so if you want to run a RS Server, and don&#39;t know anything about how to, we will do it all for you.

Every week a registered member gets randomly selected for a free 1024MB RAM Windows/Linux VPS. (So why not go and register for you chance to win a free Linux/Windows VPS?)

How am I doing this? because I made £5000 from a scratch card so I have enough money atm to do this.

Why am I doing this? Because Im rich bitch. On a serious note, to try and save the RSCPS scene.

We offer Operating Systems:
Linux CentOS V5
Windows Server 2003 x32-bit
Windows Server 2008 x64-bit/x86-bit

RSCPS are close to dead, even unedited shitty servers will save the RSC Scene, so make a change now!

Peace.</description>

              <p>Sounds like a cheap VPS company that I prepaid with for a number of months and then they up and vanished.</p>
<p>Not interested anyway, I’m done trying to run popular RSCPS servers when the only result is being DDoS’d and wasting money. DDoSing killed RSCPS.</p>

<p>Thanks vash.<br>
I am also going to let someone I trust to test out these servers for free, the Windows Server 2008 x64-bit and the Linux CentOS V5, probably someone like xEnt/Peeter if they want to.<br>
[/quote]i’m sure i speak on behalf of Peeter when i say, no thanks.</p>
<p>nice job on the winnings, but i don’t think saving the RSC server scene means offering 5$ fully set up servers…</p>

</aside>
<p>its a better idea then anyone i have heard. actually its the only idea i have heard cause everyone else is basically sitting back and letting it die.[/quote]its the people that make funservers that last a week thats killing the RSC scene, players are limited in this RSC scene and when a player plays a crappy server and the server ends, the player thinks the rest will be like that and leaves. 5$ servers won’t be helping it unfortunately, sure its a nice idea but it doesn’t actually help anything except the people running the server</p>
