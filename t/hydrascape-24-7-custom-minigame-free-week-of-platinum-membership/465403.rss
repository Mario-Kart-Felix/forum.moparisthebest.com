[b]What is Hydrascape and what makes it different from any other Server?[/b]

Hydrascape is the most Realistic Runescape Private Server in history, It was once the biggest and Largest Private Server around with over 200 Players on at ALL times and maxing over 500+ players online at one time! It has been running for over 4 years and is now up and running and online and ready for you ALL to play!

Hydrascape features some of the most popular and unique minigames in the history of Runescape Private Servers. Hydrascape doesn&#39;t just use any standard minigames that most servers can rip code from a source, they are all custom coded and UNIQUE to Hydrascape itself. It features &#39;Battle&#39; where you must defend yourself and others against the foul monsters that attack you, there is also a game called &#39;ZombiesX&#39; which is very similar to the Nazi Zombie game on Black ops!

I&#39;m now going to explain some of the main features of Hydrascape, that makes it what it is and unique to any other servers!

The gift system, every hour of playing you will receive gifts which could be something useless, to someone great. The longer you play the more likely you are to get rare items, /gift is how you check what you have and here&#39;s what you can get from it and more!

[IMG]http://i50.tinypic.com/10x65fk.png[/img]

Another great part of this server is the minigames which are like no other, they are unique and special because they are 100% custom!

One of the minigames is called &#39;Battle&#39; where you fight different monsters in a team to try reach the final wave, when you play this game you receive points to spend in the shop, here&#39;s what it looks like!

Also, there is many other things that makes Hydrascape what it is, such as the shops, the games and quests. Here&#39;s a few sneak peaks!

You can play BlackJack to win double your money or maybe loose it!

There&#39;s a link boat to take you to different places that will benefit you!

A special tab to get to different places, change spells, go to special places, training and minigames!

A desired tab just for PK&#39;ing - lets you know how many points you have, the shops to spend your points in and quick teleports. Everytime you kill a player you get a certain amount of points, the higher the killstreak, the larger amount of points you get per kill!

One of the greatest features of HydraScape is &#39;ZombiesX&#39; - This game is so unique that no other server has it, it&#39;s just the same as Black Ops Zombies which I&#39;m sure many of you people love! Here&#39;s some screenshots of the minigame!

Zombie minigame is nothing special, seeing as almost every server now-a-days has it. I don’t believe it belongs in the title, that’s just my personal opinion. You should include something… ‘unique’ in the title, that way when people come across it, they could possibly be more interested. (if that makes any sense)</p>

<span class="bbcode-b">What is Hydrascape and what makes it different from any other Server?</span></p>
<p>Hydrascape is the most Realistic Runescape Private Server in history, It was once the biggest and Largest Private Server around with over 200 Players on at ALL times and maxing over 500+ players online at one time! It has been running for over 4 years and is now up and running and online and ready for you ALL to play!</p>
<p>Hydrascape features some of the most popular and unique minigames in the history of Runescape Private Servers. Hydrascape doesn’t just use any standard minigames that most servers can rip code from a source, they are all custom coded and UNIQUE to Hydrascape itself. It features ‘Battle’ where you must defend yourself and others against the foul monsters that attack you, there is also a game called ‘ZombiesX’ which is very similar to the Nazi Zombie game on Black ops!</p>

<p>I’m now going to explain some of the main features of Hydrascape, that makes it what it is and unique to any other servers!</p>
<p>The gift system, every hour of playing you will receive gifts which could be something useless, to someone great. The longer you play the more likely you are to get rare items, /gift is how you check what you have and here’s what you can get from it and more!</p>
<p><img src="http://i50.tinypic.com/10x65fk.png" alt width="358" height="241"></p>
<p>Another great part of this server is the minigames which are like no other, they are unique and special because they are 100% custom!</p>
<p>One of the minigames is called ‘Battle’ where you fight different monsters in a team to try reach the final wave, when you play this game you receive points to spend in the shop, here’s what it looks like!</p>

<p>Also, there is many other things that makes Hydrascape what it is, such as the shops, the games and quests. Here’s a few sneak peaks!</p>
