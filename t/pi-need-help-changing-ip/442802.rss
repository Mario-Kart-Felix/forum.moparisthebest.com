              <p>Why are you changing the code in the class files? Those are designed to technically only be read by the JVM, which would mean that you shouldn’t change any of the coding in there. You should only worry about the java files, because those are then converted to byte code once you compile them. Also, I didn’t know that standard clients originally used with PI used GUI.</p>
