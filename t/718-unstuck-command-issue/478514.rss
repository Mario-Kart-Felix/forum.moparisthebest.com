    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-unstuck-command-issue/478514</link>
    <description>I currently have a character on my server that is stuck in a place he teled too.  As soon as you log on its a black screen then you log out instantly.  I was trying too unstuck him but I believe the command is not working....  Everything looks fine in commands.java file, any help guys?  Thanks in advanced...

[code=javascript]}
		} else {
		if(cmd[0].equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;unstuck&quot;)) {
			String name = cmd[1];
			Player target = SerializableFilesManager.loadPlayer(Utils
					.formatPlayerNameForProtocol(name));
			if (target != null)
				target.setUsername(Utils
						.formatPlayerNameForProtocol(name));
			target.setLocation(new WorldTile(3095,3497, 0));
			SerializableFilesManager.savePlayer(target);
			
			return true;

<p>Try that, it was checking if the player is not null which means it was checking if the player was online or else it did nothing.[/quote]</p>

Also i suggest that u add the command so that players cannot do this in wildy. People will abuse it. I cant tell you what the code will look like because i do not have the same source as you.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t suggest that. What if the player gets stuck in the wilderness?<br>
Make it so the player can’t use the command if they’re in combat/minigames/duels, and have them post a thread on the forums providing their proof so they can’t get into a fighting minigame then teleport out and kill people.</p>
<p>Also why do you start your shit with } else { and }? The } bracket declares the end of something, not the beginning. Your code highlighting is wrong; you’re programming in Java, not JavaScript.[/quote]<br>
I like his idea better. I also think that my idea was sorta weird…I didnt think it through all the way. Just do what fridder said.</p>
