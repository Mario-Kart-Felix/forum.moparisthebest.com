    <title>Adding Owner Crown/Chat colours</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-owner-crown-chat-colours/393503</link>
    <description>Hello, I am using a 317 Delta Source (flame all you want.)
For all these tuts, you are changing the admin crown so it looks same on owner and admin.
I was wondering if you guys could tell me how to add a crown in the chat log for OWNERS ONLY (playerRights = 3)
Thanks, and one more thing
I know my source has colors (ex: @blu@) because they are coded in some names on the rules and shops,
But they wont work in yell/ingame chat.
I was wondering if you could tell me how to fix that as well, and maybe add to yell so instead of say:
[Owner] (username): (blah blah blah)
It says:
[Owner] (username): (blah blah blah)</description>

<p>I’m looking for the color for ::yell only, and a custom crown for playerRights 3.<br>
For rights 2 and 3 they are the same crown, i wanna change for player rights 3.</p>
