    <title>PyRS - Jython powered RSPS, written in Python, with efficient Java networking</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pyrs-jython-powered-rsps-written-in-python-with-efficient-java-networking/373547</link>
    <description>Welp, here&#39;s one of my &quot;let&#39;s see if I can do [i]this[/i]&quot;, projects.
I thought it&#39;d be a cool idea to develop an RSPS in Python, but I wanted it to have efficient networking, so I used Jython and Java NIO.

Almost everything is in Python, except for my StreamBuffer utility which is capable of doing anything with the RuneScape protocol.
I&#39;m releasing it to the public, you can do whatever you want with it. Or you can do nothing with it, your choice.

All it has is [b]login[/b], as I got bored after I achieved that. Maybe I&#39;ll make player updating, but don&#39;t count on it.
Check it out if you&#39;re interested in exploring other territories with RuneScape emulation.

              <p>Welp, here’s one of my “let’s see if I can do <span class="bbcode-i">this</span>”, projects.<br>
I thought it’d be a cool idea to develop an RSPS in Python, but I wanted it to have efficient networking, so I used Jython and Java NIO.</p>
<p>Almost everything is in Python, except for my StreamBuffer utility which is capable of doing anything with the RuneScape protocol.<br>
I’m releasing it to the public, you can do whatever you want with it. Or you can do nothing with it, your choice.</p>
<p>All it has is <span class="bbcode-b">login</span>, as I got bored after I achieved that. Maybe I’ll make player updating, but don’t count on it.<br>
Check it out if you’re interested in exploring other territories with RuneScape emulation.</p>
