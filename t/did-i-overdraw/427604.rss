    <title>Did I overdraw?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/did-i-overdraw/427604</link>
    <description>I recently purchased a prepaid visa card from wallmart with which I payed up front with cash and filled it up with cash aswell at the register, I know for certain that I used all the money on the card but I saw something I&#39;d like to buy on eBay and filled out the form with the card details bla bla and the transaction went through and I bought it. How is this possible? Did It link to my bank account and overdraw somehow?
Of course I had to activate the card on the walmart website but all I gave them was my social security #, name, address &amp; phone number. 
If anybody has any answers that&#39;d be great, the item was only like $5 but I&#39;m still curious as to how I bought it.</description>

probably because of verifying your age of you buying<br>
(just incase your buying something your not supposed to)<br>
(at your age)</p>

<p>EDIT ;<br>
This is what the wallmartmoneycard website states,</p>
<blockquote>[u]Can I spend more money than I have on the Card?[/u]
<p>No. But, sometimes a merchant will make a mistake and accept your Card even though you didn’t have enough money on it. Should this happen, you are responsible for this payment. Please refer to the Cardholder Agreement for more information.</p>

<p>Hmm, your account will probably get a temp ban till the money is paid back. If not, you are a lucky person and just got something free. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
