    <title>NPC Dialogue triggered through an area?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-dialogue-triggered-through-an-area/263808</link>
    <description>What i&#39;m stuck on is, when you say, walk into an area on your map,
I&#39;d like it to trigger a certain NPC Dialogue from my methods, but i&#39;m a bit stuck on it,

What i basically want is when you walk into say, The Barbarian Village, you will hear one of the barbarians shout; &quot;Halt there, your kind is not welcome here!&quot;, that&#39;s the basic concept.

I thought the code snippet would be like this;
[code]
boolean isInArea(XXXX, YYYY, XXXX, YYYY) {
npcDialogue();
return = true; // Not sure if needed, but i would say so.
[/code]

Sorry for not using indentions or anything, it wouldn&#39;t let me,
anyway, does anybody have an idea?</description>
