<p>Yeah people can’t believe me when I tell them my ipod touch came to $360 with the tax. irl and online, I am told I should have gotten something cheaper. I’ve used many different kinds, but I chose the ipod touch because I fell in love with it. It’s the most user friendly I’ve ever used, which is why it was perfect for my car stereo system.</p>
<p>$360 was A LOT. But I got what I wanted.</p>

              <p>I read wozniak’s autobiography, and it said he gets paid like a standard engineer wage, just to go round doing talks and stuff every now and then. That would be awesome, invent something leave the company but get paid enough of a wage each year to live a relatively normal life. He could just chill and smoke weed all day, serious business.</p>

<p>Maybe he isn’t the most technically involved person at the company anymore. But his philosophy that he has forced upon his Apple has been seen through the products and they’ve been the ones that have put Apple in the position they are today.</p>
<p>Steve Wozniak is amazing though.</p>

              <p>I’ve never understood the big deal about Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>He helped create a massively successful company, but he did it out of his friends invention, Steve Wozniak’s Apple II and it was Wozniak that remained an Engineer, refusing to be a CEO or anything, making him the hero, IMO.</p>
<p>Obviously it’s a pity if he is going to die, and he certainly is an intelligent man, but he seems just to be a people person, simply knowing how to best gain popularity. He’s no philanthropist, like Bill Gate’s either.</p>
