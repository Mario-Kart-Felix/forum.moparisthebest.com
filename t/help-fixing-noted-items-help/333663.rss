    <description>well, on my server, when i either spawn an item or withdraw one from my bank, and it&#39;s noted, it does not stack. the item is noted like it&#39;s suppose to be, but the noted item does not stack on the next one. and also, when i click withdraw as a noted, it doesn&#39;t. just withdraws as a normal item. any advice on how to fix?</description>

go into your client files, class.java, and go to the item your spawning, and put for the item, should say somethinglike stackable:/true<br>
[/quote]<br>
Don’t post unless you know what you’re talking about.<br>
You’re posting unhelpful information.</p>
<p>There’s no “class.java” and stackable items are determined by the server code.<br>
Usually in item.java (317)</p>
<p>Just search “stackable” and add the item id’s.</p>
<p>If this is not a 317, post your server version, and I’ll post the correct way.[/quote]<br>
ty very very very very much. my server version is either 508 or 577, i’m not sure…sorry! but i think it’s 508.</p>
