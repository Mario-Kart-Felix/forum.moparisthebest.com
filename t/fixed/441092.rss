    <description>Hi, I decided just to recycle this thread again. I came across another problem where I cannot walk or anything. Here&#39;s what I added under public boolean wear():

[code]if(wearID == 7433){
    setAnimation(1501);
    playerSE = 1500;
    playerSEW = 1501;
    playerSER = 1501;
    playerSEA = 1501;
}[/code]
I grabbed the code from someone&#39;s tut I found while searching this a bit more...

I tested it and it does the animation but I just cant walk around or anything... Help?

EDIT: Fixed! All I did was remove the setAnimation line and it worked. Woot!</description>
