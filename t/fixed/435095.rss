    <description>Hey guys, 
I changed my client for the good of the server and with the old client private messages and clan chat worked. Now that I switched its not sending nor receiving messages. Also with the clan chat you can not leave the cc and join in again with a different name. I have been looking in the client for some time now but I just can not find a fix. If anyone could help me it would be great or even telling me where it is located will be splendid(:
Thanks&lt;3</description>
