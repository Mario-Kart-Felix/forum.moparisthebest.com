    <description>[s]I&#39;m currently working on dialogues on my server and I&#39;m missing three methods which handle NPC dialogue. I have the sendNpcChat4 method, but I need the first, second and third. I&#39;ve already tried making them myself by removing strings in the other methods to apply to what I want, but instead of having a blank line, it just shows Line2, Line3, Line4, etc. If anyone knows how to fix that or if you have the methods, please post them below.  :)[/s]

Nevermind, found them in an old project of mine.</description>
