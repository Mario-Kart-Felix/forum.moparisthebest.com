    <title>Can Anyone Help me - Custom Items</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-anyone-help-me-custom-items/228705</link>
    <description>I added a custom item. My client freezes when I loaded it, even though I said &#39;add model NAME&#39; and it added correctly.

I think I have incorrect ints, and I get an error with another class, here&#39;s the error with other class:

I remember reading someone saying how they add something to this class to make their items work (they weren&#39;t talking to me, I was just reading a thread, so I can&#39;t reach them) Hopefully someone knows what to add?

Also, I noticed that in the already added models to my client, when I extract them, the file inside&#39;s name is different?

So if it&#39;s name is 4201.gz, and I extract it, the file inside could be called 19052 (random number)... Wtf is up with that? When I gzip my file, it stays with the same name...</description>
