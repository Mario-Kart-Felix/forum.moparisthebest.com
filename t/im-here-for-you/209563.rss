I was depressed, that’s why I started working out. Now I’ve never felt better. I would recommend it to anyone who’s feeling down.

<p>?? Are you suggesting that in so inactive on these forums that I’ve had to, right now, go and read some of his past posts? Just because I don’t comment on everything he says or partake in discussion he was i doesn’t mean I didn’t read them. I know what he’s like to a limit, you just know a bit more. But I’ll tell you one thing for certain, nobody on this forum knew what he was like when he wasn’t on IRC, when he was at school or outside of the house. There could have been so many more reasons that none of us knew about for him to kill himself. So don’t act like you know him just becasue you have talked to him on the internet.</p>

<p>I didn’t say I knew him in that way, you’re saying you know him and you’re judging us for saying he would laugh at this topic, which he fucking would.</p>

              <p>?? Are you suggesting that I’m so inactive on these forums that I’ve had to, right now, go and read some of his past posts? Just because I don’t comment on everything he says or partake in discussions he was in doesn’t mean I didn’t read them. I know what he’s like to a limit, you just know a bit more. But I’ll tell you one thing for certain, nobody on this forum knew what he was like when he wasn’t on IRC, when he was at school or outside of the house. There could have been so many more reasons that none of us knew about for him to kill himself. So don’t act like you know him just because you have talked to him on the internet.</p>

Like I and probably 90% of people who visit <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>, its not a big “PLEASE SHOW SOME RESPECT” deal. All of us respect him, and I’m sure if there is some place he is at right now, dare I say it; Heaven, then I’m sure he knows that we respect him.</p>
