    <description>Hey hey hey, anyone else adore Dark Souls one and two like me? Easily my favorite game, if I could, I would spend my entire days on this game. On the first Dark Souls, I had a level 211 (I think? Been too long since I&#39;ve played it) cleric, which was mostly a strength build other than the fact I had two heals I used in battle occasionally. On Dark Souls 2 (which I had bought months after it came out, so I didn&#39;t get to play it on initial release), I am currently working on a faith build level 108 cleric. I&#39;m currently farming the Mad Warrior mask in Belfry Sol. Anyone else want to share? Ask questions, or just talk about the game in general? :D</description>
