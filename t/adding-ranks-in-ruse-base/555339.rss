    <description>I&#39;m trying to add a hardcore account to the Ruse base. I changed this

[code]

public enum GameMode {

    NORMAL,
    IRONMAN,
    HC_ IRONMAN;[/code]

to this

[code]

public enum GameMode {

    NORMAL,
    HC_ACC,
    IRONMAN;[/code]

When I go select the hardcore acc, it shows an ironman icon and for the ironman account is a hardcore ironman icon. 
I want to select a hardcore account with no icon next to it.
So it can look like this
[code]public enum GameMode {

    NORMAL,
    HC_ACC,
    IRONMAN,
    HC_IRONMAN;[/code]
But if I do those 4, the hardcore ironman account will have a smiley face icon next to it&#39;s name from the other &lt;img&gt; tag. I think this has to do with the packet stuff. But I don&#39;t think I know how that works. Could someone help me with this please?</description>

              <p>Did you disregard what I said?<br>
I told you exactly how to make it do what you’re asking about.<br>
All the iron man ranks are, are modIcons.</p>
<p>And your code proves it, right at the start:</p>
<p><code>if (playerRights &gt; 0) {
	client.modIcons[playerRights].drawTransparentSprite(xPos + 1 + getOffSetX(), positionY - 11 + getOffSetY(), 255);
	xPos += 11;
	} 
	else if(playerRights == 0 &amp;&amp; ironman &gt; 0) {
		client.modIcons[11 + ironman].drawTransparentSprite(xPos + 1 + getOffSetX(), positionY - 11 + getOffSetY(), 255);
		xPos += 10;
	}</code><br>
See how it says 11 + ironman?<br>
That means it’s starting (no matter what) at the 12th index (Cause Java starts at 0) for your icons, then adds the value of the iron man.</p>
<p>This is what I was talking about earlier.<br>
You will need to increase the size of the modIcons array and then after the <span class="bbcode-i">original</span> loading for your current mod icons, you will add in the code (similar to what I provided) to load the new ones.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>It’s possible to create a second “sprite cache” containing just your mod icons, then rename it such (Like modicons.dat and modicons.idx).<br>
But for you to do that, you’d have to add in some new loading methods (Basically copy/paste existing and rename) to the client.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I figured out how to just move every sprite down in the<br>
unpacked sprites folder and do it that way, but I really don’t want too.<br>
So I thought of an idea. Maybe I can just make another folder only for the "modIcons"<br>
and anytime I wanted to add more sprite icons, I can do it that way right?<br>
Otherwise, I’ll show you how the client is doing the ironman icons.<br>
So basically, the ironman accounts are still normal players, but with icons.<br>
So I see them doing this for the chat area</p>
<p><code>if (playerRights &gt; 0) {
	client.modIcons[playerRights].drawTransparentSprite(xPos + 1 + getOffSetX(), positionY - 11 + getOffSetY(), 255);
	xPos += 11;
	} 
	else if(playerRights == 0 &amp;&amp; ironman &gt; 0) {
		client.modIcons[11 + ironman].drawTransparentSprite(xPos + 1 + getOffSetX(), positionY - 11 + getOffSetY(), 255);
		xPos += 10;
	}</code><br>
If I wanted to make another “ironman” icon, but the ironman icon numbers are 839.png and 840.png.<br>
How can I let the client and source know that the next ironman icon would be 1190.png and not 841.png?<br>
Since, that’s the next sprite to add in the folder.</p>
<p>Next, this is what I found in the source.<br>
GameMode.java, for normal acc, ironman, and hardcore ironman.<br>
I want to add a “hardcore” account, that has harder xps than normal, but isn’t an ironman.<br>
If I do this the fourth one in the enum would have a smiley face icon.<br>
Since in the sprites folder, after the “hardcore ironman” rank icon, it’s the smiley faces.<br>
I don’t want to have an icon for the hardcore account,<br>
but I do want the icon on it to be gone.<br>
The account I select for example “hardcore” would show ironman icon, but it shouldn’t.<br>
Yet, the account doesn’t play like an ironman, only that it has an icon.<br>
So that means it’s somewhere in the client side that I need to look around for to get it fixed.<br>
So instead of it like this.</p>
<p>[code]public enum GameMode {</p>
<pre><code>NORMAL, //no rank
HARDCORE, //I just added this one, but shows ironman icon
IRONMAN, //hardcore ironman icon
HARDCORE_IRONMAN; //smiley face icon[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>It can look like this</p>
<p>[code]public enum GameMode {</p>
<pre><code>NORMAL, //no rank
HARDCORE, //no rank, but harder xps
IRONMAN, //ironman icon
HARDCORE_IRONMAN; //hardcore ironman icon[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>It also has this in the file</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>PacketSender.java</p>
<p><code>public PacketSender sendIronmanMode(int ironmanMode) {
		PacketBuilder out = new PacketBuilder(112); //How do these packet builders work and how do you know which number to put?
		out.put(ironmanMode);
		player.getSession().queueMessage(out);
		return this;
	}</code></p>
<p>Also, I saw this in the drawBasicString method in rsfontsystem.java</p>
<p><code>if (effectString.startsWith(startImage)) {
							try {
								int offsetY = 0;
								int imageId = Integer.valueOf(effectString.substring(4));
								if(imageId &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; imageId &lt;= 11) { //Player icons
									imageId = 827 + imageId; //828 - 838 are player icons, ex: mod,admin,donor,etc.
								} else if(imageId &gt;= 12 &amp;&amp; imageId &lt;= 31) { //Smilies
									imageId = 838 + imageId; //841, 850 - 869 are emoticons, ex: happy,sad,mad,etc.
									offsetY += 3;
								}</code></p>

Ruse uses <img> for both mod icons and clan chat ranks.</p>
<p>When you do the 4 game modes, and you get the smiley face, it’s because the new rank has its <img> icon the same of that as the “friend” rank in clan chat.<br>
To fix this you’d have to either A) pack a new sprite to the end of the cache and then “cheap hack” it to be the next rank BEFORE the clan chat icon.<br>
or B) move literally every sprite 1 index down (so 0 would become 1) from where the clan chat rank is, to the end of your sprites. You’d have to change every bit of code that uses any sprite after the one you’re changing, as they’ll all be off by 1 now.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Alright, I just packed a new sprite to the cache to test for the hardcore account. How would I go about “cheap hack”-ing it now? I don’t want to do the second suggestion. Mind looking how to do this with TeamViewer? If that’s ok with you, that is.</p>
<p>I saw this in the playerupdating.java Thought it might help you with anything</p>
<p><code>/**
	 * This update block is used to update player chat.
	 * @param builder	The packet builder to write information on.
	 * @param target	The player to update chat for.
	 * @return			The PlayerUpdating instance.
	 */
	private static void updateChat(PacketBuilder builder, Player target) {
		Message message = target.getChatMessages().get();
		byte[] bytes = message.getText();
		builder.putShort(((message.getColour() &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; 8) | (message.getEffects() &amp; 0xff), ByteOrder.LITTLE);
		builder.put(target.getRights().ordinal());
		builder.put(target.getGameModeType().ordinal()); 
		builder.put(bytes.length, ValueType.C);
		builder.putBytesReverse(bytes);
	}</code>[/quote]<br>
I don’t use ruse so you’re going to have to bare with me.</p>
<p>Somewhere within your client code, you will have similar to this for loading your mod icons:</p>
<p><code>		for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 12; i++) {
			modIcons[i] = getCacheSprite(cacheSpriteId);
			cacheSpriteId++;
		}</code></p>
<p>In this case, the for loop is just so it iterates through 13 times, setting each index of modIcons to that of the sprite it’s loading from the sprite.dat/idx.<br>
What <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> will have to do is this:<br>
Pack your new mod icon to the <span class="bbcode-u">END</span> of the sprite cache. Keep note of it’s id in the cache.<br>
Underneath the code for loading the mod icons (see above)<br>
You’d put something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>obviously replacing the capitalized text with numbers.<br>
Example for player rights: Mod is 1. The index in the modIcons array for it is 0.</p>
