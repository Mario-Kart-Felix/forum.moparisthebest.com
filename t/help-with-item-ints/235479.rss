    <title>Help with item Ints?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-item-ints/235479</link>
    <description>Hi!

I&#39;m rubbish at models, so I can&#39;t do anything with metaseq.
What I want to know is what each of the ints is on the following things:
Platebody (Trim and main colour),
Platelegs (Ditto),
Greataxe (Handle and axehead),
Flail (Handle and ball),
Full helmet (Trim and main colour),
Elemental staffs (Orb and stick thing),
Dark bow (Main and claw things on the end),
Capes (Main colour, bottom colour [as on f2p runescape capes] and possibly neck noose colour),
Dragon boots (Main colour and spikes),
R4D gloves (Main colour),
Amulets (String, gemstone and the ring that holds it),
Square shields (Main colour and outline [if they even differ]),
Kiteshields (Main colour and trim),
Dragon scimitars (Hilt and blade),
Dragon battleaxe (Handle and blades),
Bowswords (Hilt and blade) and
Guthan&#39;s spear (Handle and blade).

I know thats a massive list, but believe me, I copy and paste all the answers I ever get from anything onto notepad. I won&#39;t be forgetting these any time soon.</description>
