    <title>Removing Matrix Logo&#39;s From 718 Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/removing-matrix-logos-from-718-client/515618</link>
    <description>I need some guidance removing the logos from client. I don&#39;t mind them much but I rather not have them there + I think I will release a all purpose client that is 718 if I can remove it. Can anyone either point me to a decent 718 client or help me remove the logos. 

Thanks in advance.</description>
