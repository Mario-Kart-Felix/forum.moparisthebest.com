    <description>[center]ECLIPSE-RSPS V4[/center]
Eclipse-Rsps V4 is now open for everyone to play. I invite everyone to come have a good time with me on this new RSPS. We have just opened and i currently have 12 online. Which isnt good but i wouldnt say its bad :P. I&#39;m really just having this server online to have a good time and to have fun, so everyone is welcome to come play.
