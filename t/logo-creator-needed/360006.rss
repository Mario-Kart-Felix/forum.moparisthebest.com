    <title>Logo creator needed?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/logo-creator-needed/360006</link>
    <description>Okay, so I&#39;m wanting to open a server thats called &quot;darkside&quot;. Ive got most of it set up, but need to make a site for it. Before I do, I really need a good logo to go along with it. I dont know if this is where I should be posting this, so move it if needed.
Anyways, so what I need in the logo is something that has to do with darth vader, or another prominent &quot;darkside&quot; figure. Colors are like black, white, and yellow. Have something that says &quot;darkside&quot; on it; and instead of a really serious looking star wars thing, something thats more on the &#39;pimp&#39; side. If someone could do this for me, it would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks.</description>

<p>No one is going to just give you a logo like that.[/quote]<br>
Or you can download photoshop. Or you can even use paint or gimp!</p>
