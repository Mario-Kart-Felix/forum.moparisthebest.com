    <title>Oh justice, where art thou?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/oh-justice-where-art-thou/337400</link>
    <description>Lol, I know a bunch of people agree with me here. Though I was just in IRC and got banned, probably with good reason, I just wanted to know why I got banned(the first time). Then I got banned again. So, many people(once again) agree with me that not only moparisthebest.com and the moparisthebest.com forums have corrupt staff. Now I&#39;m not personally pointing any fingers, but you all know what I&#39;m talking about. People getting banned for not a reason, people getting over-punished for less a reason. People being under-punished for things they should have been ip-banned for, but didn&#39;t because they have friends in high places.

All I&#39;m saying is, this used to be a nice community, back in the day. MITB I can tell you see, exactly, what I&#39;m talking about. You still see, that it is, what it is, in this community. But your faculty is gone down in the gutter. 

Now I&#39;m not saying that I shouldn&#39;t have been banned, but what was the point of banning my IP? Was that MITB&#39;s decision? I wouldn&#39;t be suprised... Then again the last time I talked to him he didn&#39;t use the words... &quot;You need to learn when to shut the fuck up.&quot; When defending my own-self against the verbal attacks of said member &quot;Unhandled&quot;. 

I remember back in the day this was a proud peaceful community, where noob and fellow programmer were treated alike without question and definitely without flame, or has thou time been forgotten? 

Maybe, I don&#39;t remember. Maybe, that time is completely forgotten... MAYBE... I&#39;ve completely lost my mind. But then all the people I&#39;ve talked to about it, since said opposition, have agreed that MITB staff is corrupt, unjust, they will ban because they can, and will be afflicted, and conflicted with reason to ban.

Then again I&#39;m obviously just spewing out my ***..  You can ban my IP again, but I do have a router and I can keep changing it to get my message out there. I would appreciate it though, because I hate unplugging the interwebz for 10 mins :(

You just think you’re cool because you don’t know any better. You being adopted an all, nobody knows your mom but me. I was tappin’ her drunk ass last night.

<p>are just a few examples of the sort of person you are.</p>
<p>As far as your previous ban goes (which was notably only a ban from making posts and using the PM system), I was the one who put it in place.<br>
And after reviewing your posts, I truly believe that ‘You need to learn when to shut the fuck up’ is as good a reason as any for removing you from this community.</p>
<p>You’re nothing but a common troll, and one of your posts above even shows you asking for a ban. While I don’t ban people ‘just because’ on request, you deserved an exception.</p>

<p>I’m not evading a ban, and I answered your question. Sorry if I have to edit my post to figure it out, most likely I have a brain disability aka I’m a fucking retard. My username was Stability666, I was banned because I was defending myself against a bunch of flame posts from “Unhandled” and a few other veteran members. (Said posts have been deleted)</p>

              <p>Lol, I know a bunch of people agree with me here. Though I was just in IRC and got banned, probably with good reason, I just wanted to know why I got banned(the first time). Then I got banned again. So, many people(once again) agree with me that not only <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> and the <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> forums have corrupt staff. Now I’m not personally pointing any fingers, but you all know what I’m talking about. People getting banned for not a reason, people getting over-punished for less a reason. People being under-punished for things they should have been ip-banned for, but didn’t because they have friends in high places.</p>
<p>All I’m saying is, this used to be a nice community, back in the day. MITB I can tell you see, exactly, what I’m talking about. You still see, that it is, what it is, in this community. But your faculty is gone down in the gutter.</p>
<p>Now I’m not saying that I shouldn’t have been banned, but what was the point of banning my IP? Was that MITB’s decision? I wouldn’t be suprised… Then again the last time I talked to him he didn’t use the words… “You need to learn when to shut the fuck up.” When defending my own-self against the verbal attacks of said member “Unhandled”.</p>
<p>I remember back in the day this was a proud peaceful community, where noob and fellow programmer were treated alike without question and definitely without flame, or has thou time been forgotten?</p>
<p>Maybe, I don’t remember. Maybe, that time is completely forgotten… MAYBE… I’ve completely lost my mind. But then all the people I’ve talked to about it, since said opposition, have agreed that MITB staff is corrupt, unjust, they will ban because they can, and will be afflicted, and conflicted with reason to ban.</p>
<p>Then again I’m obviously just spewing out my ***…  You can ban my IP again, but I do have a router and I can keep changing it to get my message out there. I would appreciate it though, because I hate unplugging the interwebz for 10 mins <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>~That retard that got banned for defending his/herself</p>
