    <description>ok here&#39;s the deal
i am running my server off a client.
before i had the client some items were &#39;null&#39; in shops and some drops were too. i got the new client. and most items that were &#39;null&#39; became the items they were sposed to be.
on the other hand some &#39;null&#39; items didnt change. and the custom items that were made within that client wont shop up when i try an spawn them.

 can anyone help?</description>
