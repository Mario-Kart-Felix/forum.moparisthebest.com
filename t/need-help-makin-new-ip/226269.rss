    <title>Need help makin new ip</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-makin-new-ip/226269</link>
    <description>You will see the ip that you have made and with your account name.  Check the ip you want used and then close. 

Congrats, you are done with getting no-ip.  Now portforwarding.

First of all, go to start.  Then run then type in cmd and press ok.  Inside the black box type in ipconfig.

Now remember the default gateway!

Go into the address bar and type it in.

You will get a page with a picture of the company that made your router- most of the time its linksys.

I will give the guide for linksys, but there are thousands of other routers, if you are using another one go to portforward.com.

Note this guide that I am about to post is directly from portforward.com
Use your default gateway not the one mentioned in the guide.


Open a web browser like internet explorer or Netscape. Enter the ip address of your router in the address bar of your browser. In the picture above the address bar has http://www.google.com in it. Just replace all of that with the ip address of your router. By default the ip address should be set to 192.168.1.1.

You should see a box prompting you for your username and password. Enter your username and password now. By default both the username and password are admin. Click the Ok button to log in to your router.

Need help on there cause i got a router.</description>
