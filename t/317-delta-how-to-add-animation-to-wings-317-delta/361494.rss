    <description>OK i have recently added added wings of different assortments onto my Client and Server.....
i have them set in the cape spot as if they were capes, like they should be.
but how do i make them to where..when you wear them, you fly..
Like Weps. look like...
[code]public int GetWepAnim(int id)
{
if(id == -1) // unarmed
{
return 422;
}
if(id == 837)
{
return 1084;
}
if(id == 3190 || id == 3192 || id == 3194 || id == 3196 || id == 3198 || id== 2697 || id == 3202 || id == 3204) // halberds
{
return 440;
}[/code]
and such as that,but...I have tried &quot;public int GetCapeAnim&quot;
and it does not work...So  can anyone help?I am using a Delta base.</description>
