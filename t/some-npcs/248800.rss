    <title>Some Npcs?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-npcs/248800</link>
    <description>Ok, some NPC&#39;s don&#39;t spawn. I have put them in autospawn, and they won&#39;t come out. I made the Npc.cfg the resapwan thing to like 10 secs. The slayer tower upstairs and part of downstairs dont have any monsters. Gargoyles are not in my downstairs place. And all of the mosnter, such as abby demons, are not upstairs. Help?

I am using Richsacape source.</description>
