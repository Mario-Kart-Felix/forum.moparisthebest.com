    <title>[Galkons] [Non] Adding New Item Slots</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/galkons-non-adding-new-item-slots/481360</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to add a new inventory slot to avoid having Barbarian Assault remove your cape, and perhaps be a sufficient slot for anything else.  However,  when trying to find the codes for equipped items, I couldn&#39;t find anything to build off of.

Later I tried to simply convert this guide:
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=544290.0

However, I was unable to determine what the Non-renamed versions of the classes edited would be.  I used a tool to search the entirety of my client files and found no instances that made any reference to equipping or removing items etc.   I also have no idea what the Non-renamed versions of the client-sided code presented in the link are.

Any help is appreciated, thanks!</description>
