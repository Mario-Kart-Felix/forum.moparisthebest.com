              <p>Zyphyr has launched! Special thanks to Motherboard and myself for busting our asses the past few weeks getting everything set up and good to go and our lovely GFX designer Tyler, along with the other people who have helped such as Shadow with the forums, and so on. Now you can play once again the most beloved Pre-EoC server on the internet! Come join our community today, as we are looking to build an active community since it is day one. Having active players helps out as there are minigames that revolve around team work, distractions and diversions which benefit you with more people, automated events to bring together players, group bossing raids, and so much more.</p>
<p>Enjoy your adventure!<br>

          <blockquote>
              <p>The layout of the forums is ridiculous, why would you put the rules board at the very bottom of the page? It should be placed at the top where people will actually bother to look at them more likely than scroll all the way down to click on the board to view them that way. The staff applications board shouldn’t be under the “punishment and appeals” board - makes no sense to me. And the theme… I don’t understand why people always turn to this theme when first starting to use IPB or making a new installation of the software, why? Find another theme and do something else with that theme that’s chosen.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of themes out there that can be edited to your liking, and you would like - I’m sure.</p>
<p>As for the server, it looks decent I suppose, I’m bored so I suppose I’ll give it a go whenever it comes out.</p>
<p>P.S. I’d suggest removing the birthday registration section as it’s bugged for whatever reason (unless you know how to fix it - have at it), it causes members to not be able to register unless you click on the ‘Create Account’ part and not the ‘Continue’).</p>
