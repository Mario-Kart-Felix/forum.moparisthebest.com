    <description>Nurok - The NewAge of Spell Casters

[size=24pt][font=impact]Story Line[/font][/size]
You wake-up...feel the cold breeze...and are suddenly shocked awake by the sudden realization that...you don&#39;t know where you are...or even who you are. You look up and a man is looking around. He realizes you are awake and rushes to your side. And speaks to you, &quot; Thank Goodness you are awake! I was so worried after those wounds in the battle I wouldn&#39;t be able to save you from passing over to the spirit world. &quot; &quot;Battle...passing over...Who...are you?&quot; The old man responds &quot; Right now who I am isn&#39;t important. The battle, the one between the Magical Beings, and the Guild, consisting of the guards of every city. It ended the way we all knew it would, with Magic and Destruction both prevailing, for one could not occur without the other.&quot;  &quot;Control over this land, known as Nurok, is now decided by whom-ever controls the Orb of Occulus. It was the construction of this orb by the Grand Masters of each of the four Magical Elements, Alchemy Arcane Elemental and Mystic, that brought about the end of the battle, this orb now self aware, somehow realized itself to be in great danger if one of the Elements tried to destory the orb to prevent another Element from controlling the land, so the Orb of Occulus simply vanished. None of the elements knows where it has gone, though there is still a steady increase in harmony amongst the land so they are sure it has not left Nurok.&quot; Old man takes a deep breath from story, he looks almost dead from exhaustion, and continues &quot;I need you. To find this orb. And help the Grand Masters to reach an agreement over control of Nurok.&quot; You reply, &quot; And how exactly do you expect me to do this?&quot; Man draws a rattling breath, &quot;I have the power to place you into the world in control of the Magical Element of your choice since you are still currently in the in-between state, between life and death. Choose wisely, the fate of your life and thousands of others rests with you and your ability to complete this quest.&quot; &quot; I choose to become a(n)...&quot;
And the game begins.....

[size=24pt][font=impact]How the game will break down:[/font][/size]
So the new idea for the game is four elements, however they are Elements of Magic, the different core classes of Magician. You choose which group you want to be, two of which are considered Good and two of which more generally Evil, however this will be a point in the story later on.
Magical Elements:
[size=18pt][u]Alchemy[/u][/size]: Ability to transform. Self, objects, items, so on. This alchemy group of magicians have been able to move past the  Drawing of transmutation circles and can just perform the magic after having read the spell&#39;s (&#39;method&#39; for alchemists if you want me to be specific) instructions. All about changing from one thing to another no matter the target. Beyond that they will also be able to create a Mutation Shield that transmutes all incoming spells into air, though it isn&#39;t able to block everything and drains Mana quickly. These are just a few points for this element.
[size=18pt][u]Arcane[/u][/size]:
The combat Magic of sorts. Though this does not fit in with the typical Arcane Magic style description, Arcane magic is so broad it has many different classifications. Combat magic is the main specialty for this Element. They also have the powerful ability to spawn Familiars. Though keeping them spawned drains mana so the amount spawned is limited. They are powerful allies that attack whenever their master does and follows him/her around.
[size=18pt][u]Elemental[/u][/size]:
Uses the Elements and Nature to do anything from combat magic to interacting with the everyday environment.
[size=18pt][u]Mystic[/u][/size]:
The real Magic of the elements. With powers ranging from binding another sorcerer where they stand to warping within 30steps and even casting powerful shields to protect them and their party. They will also be the Buffers of the game. The Mystic&#39;s will turn out to be the Tanks of the game. Able to deal low consistent damage but much better at protecting others and healing, as well as buffing players.


The client being used for the game was developed and created by S W A T, I give him great thanks for his open-source full 
screen 317 client, I am currently doing heavy editing to the cache and setup of the client. When done, upon running the client will auto-resize to your screen size/resolution, with minimizeable interfaces and such as well as well integrated hotkeys.

Your thoughts?

You should try changing RuneScape’s whole map and make it your own.</p>

<p>I need some help brainstorming Names for the Regions. Be creative. If I use anything submitted by you you will be in the credits page that I am compiling that will be added into the game/client.</p>
<p>Also if you are wanting to apply to be part of the Modeling team you need to talk to Amy_Webb. Any items added to the client must be viewed and accepted by her.</p>

The source I am working with may not be the best, its an old source based off wL (very old source), but I don’t see myself needing to hold very many players atleast not right away. If the server manages to grow in ways I think it will not then i will move to a more stable source and move over all the content.</p>

<p>IF, and I say IF, this project completes, I’m pretty sure Nurok will be the next generation of Private Servers! If then you converted every model, animation, sprite and interface to your own - you’d of created your own game!</p>

              <p>Ok so me and amy have worked out a system for the game.</p>
<p>The ideology for how training works comes from a game called MU.</p>
<p>A player starts out in one of two beginner towns, depending on which Element you choose. The whole of Nurok is broken up into different regions. ( I won’t be using the whole of RuneScape map, so maybe I can create a world map using Photoshop and just cutting the Regions out manually and forming them together.)<br>
From there, you can visit a few shops and search around for hidden items in the Safezone/Town.  Or you can leave the town and venture out into the Wilderness of the town. Example being Yanille, and wilderness being leaving the gates. From there you can travel a fair distance, different regions being different sizes. Before you will reach the edge of the region. At different edges of the region it may have portals/gateways that allow you to travel into another region. All are interconnected in some way. You must have a certain total level to go to the next Region and fight stronger monsters.<br>
Training is done by exp per damage done on monsters, you will also be able to cast non-combat skills and gain some experience as well.</p>
