    <title>A few questions about a 562 server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions-about-a-562-server/378886</link>
    <description>Hello. It&#39;s been a while sense I&#39;ve been here. I recently set up a 562 server and client on my web site.

I need a little help:

[s]First: Moving objects. In the old days there was an objects.cfg. Now all I can find is a objects.dat. I need to move a portal from one place to another.[/s]
Solved:ActionSender.java in net source folder.

Second: Is there a way to see the npc, item, and object ID&#39;s in game? Like a debug command?

[s]Third: How do I change the player teleport spell locations. I searched forever and could not find the player teleport java file. I did find how to edit player spells and their power and such but not the teleports. [/s]
Solved: ActionButtonPacketHandler.java

Fourth: Is there a tutorial on how to make item pickups a single click? Right now, when someone drops something you have to walk over it and click it again. Same with trading NPS&#39;s. How would I go about making this a single click?

I&#39;m new to the 562 and have searched for ever on my own. Any help?? 

Thanks guys!</description>
