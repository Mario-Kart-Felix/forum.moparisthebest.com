I&#39;m here to recruit developers in to this project which most likely will be succesful.

It&#39;s a 718 loading 742 cache, I have amazing idea for it.

[b]The idea[/b]
This would be the worlds first &#39;open-world&#39; RSPS which means theres content around the world and there wouldn&#39;t be actual home, I think people would love this since EOC ruined RS competely but it won&#39;t be a re-make though, we could add EXP rates that people can choose and other little utilities. [b]The project&#39;s name is Neptus.[/b]

[b]What you need to join?[/b]
Java programming experience.
Skype account.
You must be dedicated to this project.

About Myself
You probably know me, my name is Fuzen Seth in r-s + RuneLocus, I have made succesful servers such as Mentios, also Enso is incredible RSPS. 

Some features this project will include
-World-wide content.
-Minigames (Artisan&#39;s Workshop) and other amazing, unique minigames.
-Quest system
-Grand Exchange (makes this really fun since it&#39;s open-world)
And much more, can&#39;t list all.
-World content (buckets, sawmills, port phasmatys, ship charter, world-wide ship travelling, fairy rings)
-Full lobby to make it realistic as possible but I have nearly done it :)


I have money also to setup us online for public. But this project will be long in development that&#39;s why I need some serious developers.
