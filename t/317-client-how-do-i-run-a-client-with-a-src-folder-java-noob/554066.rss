    <title>317 Client - How do I run a client with a src folder? (Java noob)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-client-how-do-i-run-a-client-with-a-src-folder-java-noob/554066</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I have a client that I want to run but its one src folder with subfolders like com, runescape, net, etc. There&#39;s no .bat file to run it and I&#39;m not sure what classpath to add to a .bat if I were to make one ;s I dont even know what class the client runs off. Can someone tell me what to do please?

Thank you!</description>

              <p>Demogorgon, add me on skype @ eyeownyew. Usually helping entirely new people but you seem like you’re pretty intelligent and just having a difficult time getting it off the ground – no worries, totally understandable. I’d be happy to help you understand more about how to get your server off the ground and programming as a whole, but it would be way easier to explain things through a messenger like skype</p>

To create the &gt;working&lt; bat file you need to place specific arguments into it. First being, the program you’re running (Java).<br>
Then - each program can have it’s own arguments. In Java’s case, there’s PLENTY.<br>

<p>Thanks so much for the reply! There was in fact no bin folder, so I ran the client in eclipse and it came up with errors but at least it compiled and made a bin folder. I assume the class to run would be the largest one, called “Game” with 30kb. I made a .bat for it and I get a "Exception in java thread “main” java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Game (wrong name: com/jagex/runescape/Game) at blah blah blah. Could you please tell me what I did wrong? Thank you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
[/quote]<br>
One problem is; your client is packaged. So when making a bat file, you cannot refer to the main class as simply “Game” if it is in the package com.jagex.runescape. You would actually have to refer to it as com.jagex.runescape.Game.<br>
Also, did you make sure to run the client in Eclipse first? It will automatically search for a main class, and display the ones that exist. That would help you figure out which is the actual one - instead of guessing (Though you may have to guess between the ones listed).[/quote]</p>

This would be easy for someone experienced with Java and someone that knows what bat files are/how to use them. That is why I suggest you to do the first option (Also is why that is the first option).<br>
To create the &gt;working&lt; bat file you need to place specific arguments into it. First being, the program you’re running (Java).<br>
Then - each program can have it’s own arguments. In Java’s case, there’s PLENTY.<br>
I’m not going to go in-depth over this - as that would take at least an hour just to write.<br>

<p>Thanks so much for the reply! There was in fact no bin folder, so I ran the client in eclipse and it came up with errors but at least it compiled and made a bin folder. I assume the class to run would be the largest one, called “Game” with 30kb. I made a .bat for it and I get a "Exception in java thread “main” java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Game (wrong name: com/jagex/runescape/Game) at blah blah blah. Could you please tell me what I did wrong? Thank you :)[/quote]<br>
One problem is; your client is packaged. So when making a bat file, you cannot refer to the main class as simply “Game” if it is in the package com.jagex.runescape. You would actually have to refer to it as com.jagex.runescape.Game.<br>
Also, did you make sure to run the client in Eclipse first? It will automatically search for a main class, and display the ones that exist. That would help you figure out which is the actual one - instead of guessing (Though you may have to guess between the ones listed).</p>

              <p>Instead of assuming the biggest one contains the main method you should just search which class contains it. To aid with your problem please post the line that you run your client with. Also when you ask for help on a problem it would probably be the best for you to put in the entire exception.</p>
