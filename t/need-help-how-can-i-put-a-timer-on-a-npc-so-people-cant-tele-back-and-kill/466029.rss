    <description>so i have a boss, and people just tele there with 1 item, spec, then tele back and forth to kill it. How can i add a timer so the person gets tele&#39;d there, and when they leave/die the npc resets for them?</description>

              <p>You can handle this in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the existing Teleblock mechanics to patch this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your N.P.C. walk away or return to their original state after combat (which they should), then you can simply refill the N.P.C.<br>
Hitpoints during this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initiate a Timer to determine when the N.P.C. can enter Combat based on the factor(s) of your choosing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simply make the time it takes to reach the Boss longer. Such as adding another area filled with aggressive N.P.C. or something similar.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, you should take out the Special Attack Refill effect. I’m guessing this is done via Duel Arena. Or counter this in some fashion.</p>

              <p>well, not sure how great that would work tbh, but best bet would make it so you cant teleport in combat so when they spec it and go into combat they are stuck fighting it lol</p>
