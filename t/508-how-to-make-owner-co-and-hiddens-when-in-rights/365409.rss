              <p>I don’t think a 508 has yet to introduce these features. I might eventually make tutorial on it though.</p>
<p>If you know what you’re doing:<br>
Change the rights byte sent on login<br>
Change permissions for commands, items etc</p>
<p>All in all it would take about 5 minutes, but I don’t really feel like spending the time at the moment to explain all of the code.</p>
