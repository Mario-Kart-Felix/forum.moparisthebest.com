    <title>Custom Mouse Spline</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-mouse-spline/304044</link>
    <description>mhm, i&#39;ve wrote once some custom mouse spline in 1 -2 hours, that&#39;ve been tested for about 1 week without any ban, and i personally am convinced that the ban rate depends on the parameters you enter, so you actually can add this to your bot and let the user choose the spline type that he wants and view a sample of it on the scene graphs.

I&#39;m convinced as well that however simple was that mouse spline, its not bannable ,that&#39;s been proved upon testing and logic.

If you do notice, you don&#39;t really move your mouse in a real curvey way, well it totally depends on the user and the mouse speed.So i personally have the pointer set on max speed, that will really let the mouse move in a semi-straight line on the long run, so it all depends, but the most important thing is that the algorithm of the spline shouldnt be based on one final unrandomized algorithm and that ofcourse the mouse path cant be one long straight line.

Now here is the youtube vid of how you can test it to generate random splines, but noticed that the modulus of amplitude and spacing should always be mutual and respective, and make sure that you lower the amplitude as much as possible to get a much more smooth curve.

Note: Amplitude &lt;= 10 should make it very human like, any value above that is under your own risk.

I&#39;ll post the application+source later on when i am on the right pc.</description>

No offense, but this is ridicules, splines are rly stupid for humanlike movement, no one moves their cursor in waves, seriously, ppl move their move in straight or slightly bent lent, i some cases moving slightly past the target and going back very fast…<br>

Hmm, I never rewrote SCAR, well, until now, which is still in progress, and I’ve never actually written any mouse algorithms before, but I’m considering to for the rewrite… Currently, SCAR has Benland’s windmouse algorithm, no more splines, it comes a lot closer to reality than splines…</p>

              <p>Like that guy said about the PMod forums, the macro system doesn’t kick in until you’re reported. And if you’re playing legit on a tablet, you won’t get reported. So the spline detection never occured.<br>
Just a suggestion.</p>

<p>Neither can the splines be replicated server side without brute forcing parameters if the spline generation method is truly random. The only thing I can think of is the time between each event, and checking mouseEntered and mouseExited events. IIRC RSBot did not call these events?</p>

<p>I remember a discussion about tablets too, but I have never had one so I have yet to test and see exactly what mouse events are being generated, as far as I know the computer could generate mouse move events from one point to another, can’t really tell without something to test on.</p>

<p>I was thinking the same thing myself. On a touchpad that is single touch, you can use two fingers to make the mouse jump all over the place. I really have no more theories of what Jagex does to detect inhuman mouse movements. Maybe they don’t even try to detect them.</p>

              <p>At my computer the time between each mouseMoved event was 8 ms. This was an average over 30 seconds of moving the mouse fast around. It is the same for going slower, but obviously ifyou go too slow it will be longer between each mouse event.</p>
<p>I assume its the same with MouseDragged events…</p>
<p>KBot PRO’s mouse uses splines to generate magnification points. Each point has a random magnification level and the end point (target) has a big magnification which gets smaller the closer you get. The mouse then follows the splines major curves, but does rarely follow the spline. The mouse randomly do a drop effect as well (simulating lifting the mouse and replacing it another place on the mouse pad).</p>
<p>I still use bezier splines for this. The start point remains the same but the end point can move under mouse move. The bot can therefor follow/hover over a moving object in game <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

dont peopel realize that it only receives mouse movements every 50 or so ms? a lot of points are missed so really it doesnt matter much…<br>
[/quote]cant this be another thing they look for? all of the points being received exactly the way they are supposed to and not missing any = bot[/quote]<br>
RSBot generates the spline then throws away most of the points. I think it does one point every x ms then the spaces between define the speed.</p>

Tenac, I think you’re wrong. There’s also no way you can predict/impersonate human like mouse movements. A neural network style approach may be conceivable. You play the game for an hour or so, which ‘trains’ or ‘teaches’ the network, the network then takes over. It could load/save these settings, and maybe even be recording in the background <em>all</em> the time.</p>
