    <title>I Need Help With A Few Things</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-a-few-things/230389</link>
    <description>Hey guys I&#39;m new to the forums
I&#39;m not a very good coder but I know stuff..

I&#39;m not 100% sure what source it is i think it is Czar  :confused: Oldkoscape it is called.

What I need help with:

1.When I do vengeance, then go to eat I get &quot;Hmm you should paint the trees....&quot;
My vengeance is on the (G) tab on ancients. I need to be a member to do it.

2.When someone dies by player or NPC, it logs them out and they can not log back in again until i restart the server (some times)

3. I would like to know how to get Skull&#39;s above peoples heads when they attack another player

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks, jay [br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 09, 2008, 12:57:27 pm[/size][hr]anyone?</description>
