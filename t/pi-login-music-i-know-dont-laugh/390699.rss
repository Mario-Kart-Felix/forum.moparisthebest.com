    <title>PI - Login Music? I know, don&#39;t laugh &gt;.&lt;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-login-music-i-know-dont-laugh/390699</link>
    <description>Once again, hey guys lol, I remember having an old 317 client and their was a music folder so you can play music while you play.(For all players who download client)

And now im here, trying to accomplish my project, of adding music to my servers log in screen for my client. but this is something that goes beyond my knowledge.

Is it possible? 

Now, I have minor programming skills, (intermediate coder)
and I am guessing the music will go into the cache if I achieve playing it on my client
and along with that I will need something in the client files that load the music, just as signlink.java loads the cache.

Ofc the music will be loaded seperately.


OR!!!!!!!!!!!!

If anyone knows how to make the music playlist work in-game?

Thanks ! I would so greatly appreciate the help lol, I don&#39;t see many servers with client music these days.

              <p>I can do the music playlist for 40m RSGP or 50 Dollars paypal. Add <a href="mailto:pritchardthomas@yahoo.com">pritchardthomas@yahoo.com</a> if interested.<br>
The other music you’re talking about, I’ll do for 20m RSGP or 30 Dollars paypal. Just send me a request.</p>
