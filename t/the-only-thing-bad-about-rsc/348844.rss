<li>stability (<span class="bbcode-b">they can’t hold a good amount of players</span> and/or they crash often and/or shutdown when jagex send a letter)</li>

<p>So your entire argument is based on what RS2 servers were like 3 years ago?</p>

I like the comments saying that RSC is shit, but not elaborating why. There is nothing wrong with RSC. In fact, it’s much better than the current RuneScape, in many ways.</p>
<p>-Not as childish as RuneScape (guards around fucking barbarian village telling you its dangerous)<br>
-Not as hands on (not telling you where to start quests, etc)<br>
-Trading, my God, trading.<br>
-Player killing.<br>

<p>You don’t really need to explain why it is shit. It just is. Hence the reason I call it shit.</p>
<p>You know, you don’t ask people why they don’t like excrement, just that it is shit (literally, in this case). Same sort of thing.[/quote]<br>

[/quote]More stable, but for reasons said by others not as widely used or appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>My post was to argue the fact you can’t compare a RSC private server and a RS2 private server based on stability and performance (considering RSC wins hands down). The game play on a RS2/RSC private server is a different matter.</p>
<p>Anyways, they both have great game play, but RSC is far more restricted then RS2, which is why RS2 is better (imo).</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>What are you talking about stability on RS2? just because half the servers released still use the shitty old Winterlove base doesn’t mean we don’t have any bases that are extremely stable, a list would be RS2DV, Hyperion, RS377, Helios, etc. You can’t compare them no matter what because they have their good parts and the bad parts. You guys just look at RS2 from the winterlove stand point and don’t add in all of the amazing scartch servers released.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, but the stereotypical rs2 private server uses a winterlove server as its base. Your argument is valid though, but you also have to take into account that RSC is much more simple game compared to RS2.</p>
<p>As I said before, I prefer RS2 over RSC, the game play is simply better.</p>

<p>You are still looking at it by the Winterlove stand point, most servers on the server status list are shit and are leeches. Also when I look in the advertising section of the RSC section I see what 331 topics? what the fuck do you call that you guys have near to no RSC servers to choose from, then i see what 3 top ones that are the only ones with atleast 200+ post that aren’t locked. Once again the only reason there isn’t any good ideas is because most people who add a server to the list don’t even know Java, again most RS2 servers have dumb names because the people who own then just joined and don’t know shit about servers.</p>
<p>Stop saying one is better then the other, because neither is better. They both have things that are better, suck, or are the same. Ive never played a RSC server, but now that I see how they hate everyone that doesn’t play RSC I am highly doubting I will play it now.</p>

<p>What are you talking about stability on RS2? just because half the servers released still use the shitty old Winterlove base doesn’t mean we don’t have any bases that are extremely stable, a list would be RS2DV, Hyperion, RS377, Helios, etc. You can’t compare them no matter what because they have their good parts and the bad parts. You guys just look at RS2 from the winterlove stand point and don’t add in all of the amazing scartch servers released.</p>
