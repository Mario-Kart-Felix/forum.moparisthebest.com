InspirePvP is a unique factions server which offers much more than just a Factions Server. Our server offers many special features such as Private Vaults and Silk Touch Spawners. Our current staff are all fully dedicated to helping the server and all of the money made from donations are recycled directly back into the server helping to make it a fun and lag-free experience. On that note, donors are treated very highly and get many extra perks including enchanted gear, special abilities, and many new commands. 

Once we get a higher player count, we have big plans for the server. We are planning on upgrading the server RAM very soon and adding a lot of new features such as Mob Arena, Cage Match, and Soup PvP (None of these conflicting with factions). I hope you guys reading can give our server a chance and try it out. Thank you for your time reading this and I hope you’ll like it on our server.</description>
