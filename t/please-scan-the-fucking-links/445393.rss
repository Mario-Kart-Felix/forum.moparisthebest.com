<p>Lol there isn’t such thing as ‘Common sense’ that’s just a lazy way of saying ‘think how I think, but I’m not sure how to explain it’. And did I say I was blaming the moderator’s for downloading a virus? No, I said I was suggesting it may be a good idea to have mods police that section to reduce the number of false posts / virus infected links.[/quote]And if you had common sense, you would see that it’s a virus and not download it.  I have seen many servers released with viruses, but I never downloaded them because I have common sense.  It’s easy to tell if it’s a virus, if you can’t tell, then you probably shouldn’t be downloading stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s not a moderators job to ‘police’ every single post.  It’s YOUR job to report the post so the moderators can decide upon an action.</p>
