    <title>Big Brother, a question on it</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/big-brother-a-question-on-it/397460</link>
    <description>Since using the X-ray mod is highly untolerated because it gives an unfair advantage and the ability to find people&#39;s chests. 

Shouldnt big brother being used in that sense to find the blocks people replace in order to find their hidden chests result in the same category as using X-ray?

I am not mentioning names or pointing fingers, i am simply asking for your opinion on the matter.</description>

<p>Because I sealed up my hole with smoothstone in a giant system of hallways of smoothstone, unless they brought stacks upon stacks of smoothstone and started digging random holes in the hallways to find my chests, then i dont see any other way that they would have found my chests without using big brother.</p>

<p>Big brother only keeps records back 2 days I believe, so it’s not like it keeps an infinite backlog of information.  In addition, if your chests are hidden behind one block, wouldn’t it be just as easy for the person using big brother to just break the block and look behind it?  I don’t really think it gives a significant advantage.</p>

<p>Thats the problem, my chests are hidden behind walls in a secret room that is blocked by a layer of 3 blocks deep. Along with a 2nd secret room behind a 2nd 3 deep layer of blocks from the 1st secret room, and then there are chests hidden in that room as well. But i was still managed to be raided because someone abused the big brother plugin to find what blocks had been recently replaced.</p>

<p>I see your point badger, it can be used to trace people’s broken and replaced blocks in order to find people chests but everything has a risk to it and i rather have big brother and lose a couple of items then get griefed without finding out who the culprit is.</p>

<p>You don’t see his point. He is not talking about removing <span class="bbcode-b">any</span> of Big Brother’s features, but merely a plugin. This plugin, to use BigBrother’s features in recording block data, to collect information, find the hidden chests and ban people who are finding that. My idea, would be a different feature. All of the said, but have some kind of a system that would decide (via wall thickness, dept, and how far it is from another opening) the level of how hidden it is, and if past a certain level (custom level set for recording), write the said player name + IP to a text file (log?) and from there the owner can take control of the situation.</p>

Since using the X-ray mod is highly untolerated because it gives an unfair advantage and the ability to find people’s chests.</p>
<p>Shouldnt big brother being used in that sense to find the blocks people replace in order to find their hidden chests result in the same category as using X-ray?</p>
<p>I am not mentioning names or pointing fingers, i am simply asking for your opinion on the matter.<br>

<p>Seriously? Dont attempt to make me look stupid when you cant even see my point.</p>
<p>People use X-ray to find others’ chests despite their attempts to hide them well.</p>
<p>While people can abuse big brother to see the places in walls where blocks have been broken and replaced to show where people hide their chests.</p>
