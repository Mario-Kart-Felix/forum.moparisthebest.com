    <title>Adding sprites help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-sprites-help/157636</link>
    <description>Hi, i have already checked at saga&#39;s adding sprites code and i dont understand it. I have been programming for about 2 years now and i have no idea how to imput it because the small code itself has 7 errors and i have no idea on how to get rid of them. Also i have a problem with my trading incrament. Whenever i trade it turns into another item and then at the second trade window it turns into two random things and then if u press accept, it never goes through. If there is someone willing to help me out i would be grateful.</description>
