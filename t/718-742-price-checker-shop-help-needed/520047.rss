    <title>718/742 Price Checker &amp; Shop [Help Needed]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-742-price-checker-shop-help-needed/520047</link>
    <description>Ok guys, I  will try to keep this short and understandable.
I know how to change the prices of items in cache, but the problem is every time I do the price of it multiplies by ridiculous number like 2.7654674 or something, not really sure and that was just an example. Also this affects the shop and items are sold for like 1/3 of the price. All I am wondering is [b]which files do I edit and what should I be searching for in them to change the multipliers for price checker and shops on 718/742 server[/b].</description>
