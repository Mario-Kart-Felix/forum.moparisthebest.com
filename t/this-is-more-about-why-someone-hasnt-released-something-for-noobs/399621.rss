    <description>this is kinda server related not really sure, but as after all these years i can still see new coders how do i get my server online or what i need im wondering why noone has been great ful enough just t omake an automatic client/server it wouldnt be to difficult i already know there is an automatic port  forwarder, and hell the person who actually makes this could get some short of money out of it depending where they place the download noobs would be great for a place where no npcs are spawn but all skills work, none of the tricks pulled when someone releases a server anyways this is just a thought, i like helping people and as you can see when i figure something out thats helpful i post it which i have (just my tut organization needs a little help ) lol but anyways just a thought would like to see this for the new coders</description>

              <p>id like to see an automatic client and server for the new coders one that isnt to easy like they need to figure out basic things like npc placement but none of the ones that have alot of shit wrong with it purposily done when they release the sourceâ€¦</p>
<p>by automatic im meaning when they unzip it opens up both client and source which is possible with sharewear i use it with my stuff i release so they dont have to even click run.bat</p>
