              <p>well… not too hard, you just have to change the exp rates , like per hit, runescape is 4 exp per hit for str att and def, if it goes to lvl 11 from 1 and it hits a two, then that is probably like 650 exp per hit, and you want it to get from 1 to 2 in<br>
when they hit a 2? 1 to 2 is 83 exp, then you want each hit 41.5 exp, im not sure were to change this, but just giving you an idea, probably in client.java though, im just giving you an idea of what it would be like</p>
