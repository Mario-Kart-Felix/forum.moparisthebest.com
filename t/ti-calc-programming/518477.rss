    <title>TI-Calc Programming</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ti-calc-programming/518477</link>
    <description>I&#39;m starting TI-Calculator threads now for mainly the 83-84 versions.
I just want to get back to programming BASIC and making complex calculator programs again.

To start off I want to ask all of you who program or have ever used a program on a TI-Calc:

What is/are the most advanced/complex things you can program/have heard of/or seen?</description>

<p>TI calculators use a subset of the BASIC language for its programs. I’m not sure if this applies up the NSpire or not. I know the 89 doesn’t seem to use as verbose of a language as the earlier TI series.</p>

I haven’t been programming any of the above languages for atleast a year now and the worst part is I lost my TI-84+ SE anyways but that doesn’t mean I can’t help out as much as I can <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I programmed them by hand, other than the ones my professor provided in linear algebra (those were inserted via TI-connection). Most of my programs are gone now, due to multiple memory failures on the 83. No big deal, they weren’t hard to write.</p>
<p>The cube program had one for actually drawing and handling the rotation of the cube points, plus taking in key input. I needed a separate program for actually rotating each quad and I forget what the third was for. I might have separated drawing out of the main program, too. Not sure.</p>

Very nice to get a comment on my thread…especially from you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> but uhm quick question, do you copy the programs from the internet or from other people OR are you actually quite fluent in BASIC or ASM( ?<br>
Also I see you mostly involve yourself with Math/Educational programs…not bad <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I specialize much more in TI-83/84 models, so would you mind telling me any, and all, programs you have on your TI-84?<br>
And can you also elaborate on how the cube program took 3 programs etc. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Thanks for commenting.</p>
