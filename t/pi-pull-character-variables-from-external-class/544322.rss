    <title>[PI] Pull Character Variables From External Class?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-pull-character-variables-from-external-class/544322</link>
    <description>I&#39;m working with sockets right now, and I&#39;m having some problems.

What I currently have: Website sends an announcement to the server, and the server displays it to all the users, and sends a thank you message back to the website. 

What I&#39;m looking to achieve: I want it so that when you type in a username on the website, it requests information from the server and displays it on the site. I know how to do it all, but I don&#39;t know how to get the player variables like bankItemsN[0] and what not. I know most systems use (this) when calling to a class, but I just can&#39;t seem to get it to work. If someone can tell me how to get player information from my class it&#39;d be [i]greatly[/i] appreciated.

Here is MyJavaServer.class which is what I use for starting the socket, processing input, and outputting an announcement.

If it helps, sockets is started when the server loads in Server.java initialize() I added MyJavaServer.main(); to call my class and start sockets.</description>
