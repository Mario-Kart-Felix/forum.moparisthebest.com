              <p>Thank you but I didn’t understand how to make an item that normal players cannot use![br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 23, 2009, 08:39:54 am[/size][hr]I wasn’t talking about making commands!<br>
I need a tut which shows how to make 2 cases:<br>
case 1 : if the character is a member he can wear the specific item<br>
case 2 : if the caracter is not a member and then it sends a message : sorry , this item is for members only!</p>

<p>Or something along those lines. Other than that, I am not quite sure.<br>
3. Character rights can be anything you want them to be. You could make admin playerRights == 8 if you want it to be. Just make it so that all of your commands make it so that it includes whatever playerRight you want to add in. For example, for your master command,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (command.startsWith("master") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 1) {</code></pre>
<p>That is saying that anyone with a playerRight value above 1 can use the command. 5 &gt; 1.<br>
As for crowns, that is client sided.</p>
