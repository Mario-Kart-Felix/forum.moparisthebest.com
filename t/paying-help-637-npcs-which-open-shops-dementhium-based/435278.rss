    <title>[Paying!][Help][637] NPC&#39;s Which Open Shops [Dementhium based]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paying-help-637-npcs-which-open-shops-dementhium-based/435278</link>
    <description>I created a custom shop using NPC 946, and i added whatever i wanted to using ShopEditor, and in dialoguemanager.java I&#39;ve added the following:

[code]		case 666:
			World.getWorld().getShopManager().openShop(player, 946);
			return false;[/code]

I&#39;ve also put up a specified spot which it spawns, which works, just when i press the NPC it doesn&#39;t do anything. No shop opens, just &quot;incoming opcode 28&quot; being printed in chat. I don&#39;t understand what i did wrong or what else i need to modify, seeing that i&#39;m new to 637, it would i suppose be &quot;understandable&quot;.

If somebody can help me A.S.A.P. that would be great.

P.S. Yes... I did compile.

Using TorvaPKz V4 (Dementhium Based) 637 loading 639.

I am now willing to pay.</description>

              <p>NOTE: I have never used this base and I’m speaking from what I’ve read about it.</p>
<p>I believe you add the shop in this method:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">private void option1(final Player player, Message in) {</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise, you’re trying to send a Dialogue which should be done like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sendDialogue(player, EMOTE, ID, ##, "Message");</code></pre>
<p>I think that’s the problem because when you’re making a shop using a 317, you have to make the NPC do something once clicked. You’re not doing that or incorrectly in this case.</p>
<p>If you need further help PM me and I’ll look into it further.</p>
