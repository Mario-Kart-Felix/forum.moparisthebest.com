    <title>English - German Item/Monster/Npc List?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/english-german-item-monster-npc-list/91719</link>
    <description>I have seen some lists with all items, examine info and id in English. It would be interesting to have these lists not only in English but in German as well. Then you could use them as an easy dictionary between the English and the German Runescape world.

I was wondering how the English lists have been created. They looked as having been dumped directly with a modified client. Has anyone yet dumped lists like this in both languages?

All hints, info or even lists would be very much appreciated. ;D</description>

              <p>I think the German itself shouldn’t be the big problem. For me the main problem is to dump a list with the ids and the names. If I can do this for the English version, then it should be possible to do it in the same way for the German version. With both lists they can be combined into one by matching the ids.</p>
<p>Dumping the English item lists has been done already, because there are lists of them around. But I do not know how it has been done, or how it could be done with the current client version. Does anyone know how these items lists have been dumped? (I could dig into the client and reinvent the wheel, but I hate to do it if we did not yet forget how the first wheel was built :D)</p>

              <p>i wold have to take an in depth look, but there are others who should already know. the item data is only read when it is first needed, then stored in memory. the examine texts are sent from the server, though the names are read from the data files. i would hazard a guess that they use 2 different sets of data, at least for this part, as after running it in english and letting it download, it still had to download when i ran the german version</p>
<p>sorry that i cannot be of more help  :rolleyes:</p>

              <p>no the names are different in both versions. A “Shark” is a “Hai” or a “Abyssal whip” is a “Hollenpeitsche”. So it could be both fun and usefull to read through a list that has both language versions in it.</p>
<p>Is there a complete list of all itmes in the cache/client? Or are the strings sent from the server when required (in use ingame)?</p>
