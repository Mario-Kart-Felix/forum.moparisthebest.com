    <description>Need to delete something but cant? Ive had this problem and I&#39;m sharing my solution with you guys :)


[img]http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/example.png[/img]
or says something like this?:

Cannot delete file: Access is denied
There has been a sharing violation.
The source or destination file may be in use.
The file is in use by another program or user.
Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use.

download:

[url=http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/old/unlocker1.8.6.exe]http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/old/unlocker1.8.6.exe[/url]

Then simply right click and go unlock like this:

or if its not locked you can do multiple stuff with the file/folder
such as:

[img]http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/1733/unlocker.png[/img]

additional stuff 
- Fixed bug: Unlocker should not create event logs anymore.
- Fixed bug: Unlocker should not take minutes to close on certain configurations anymore.
- Fixed bug: Unlocker should not lock DLLs not used by Unlocker anymore.
- Fixed bug: Fixed potential driver bug.
- Fixed bug: Miscellaneous handle leaks.
- Improved behavior: Improved deleting/renaming/moving files such as C:\WINDOWS\system32\Macromed\Flash\Flash9e.ocx for example.
- Improved behavior: When right-clicking files or folders and selecting Unlocker, those are automatically deselected. It helps with movie files and removable drives.
- Improved UI: Icon looks correct now on Windows Vista
- Promotional feature: Added fully optional shortcuts to eBay during the installation. Simply untick &quot;eBay shortcuts&quot; in the choose components page during install if you do not wish to have those.

Thanks Pkboy

PS: I did not make or improve this product i just found it on www.google.com and i wanted to share it with you guys</description>

Takes 10 seconds to download and give you the convince of not having to open task manager and searching for the process, and sometimes the process needed to be closed is explore.exe and thats a bitch to handle without this tool.</p>

              <p>Need to delete something but cant? Ive had this problem and I’m sharing my solution with you guys <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><img src="http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/example.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
or says something like this?:</p>
<p>Cannot delete file: Access is denied<br>
There has been a sharing violation.<br>
The source or destination file may be in use.<br>
The file is in use by another program or user.<br>
Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use.</p>
<p>download:</p>
<p><a href="http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/old/unlocker1.8.6.exe" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/old/unlocker1.8.6.exe</a></p>
<p>Then simply right click and go unlock like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://ccollomb.free.fr/unlocker/tutorial1.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>or if its not locked you can do multiple stuff with the file/folder<br>
such as:</p>
<p><img src="http://img137.imageshack.us/img137/1733/unlocker.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>additional stuff</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug: Unlocker should not create event logs anymore.</li>
<li>Fixed bug: Unlocker should not take minutes to close on certain configurations anymore.</li>
<li>Fixed bug: Unlocker should not lock DLLs not used by Unlocker anymore.</li>
<li>Fixed bug: Fixed potential driver bug.</li>
<li>Fixed bug: Miscellaneous handle leaks.</li>
<li>Improved behavior: Improved deleting/renaming/moving files such as C:\WINDOWS\system32\Macromed\Flash\Flash9e.ocx for example.</li>
<li>Improved behavior: When right-clicking files or folders and selecting Unlocker, those are automatically deselected. It helps with movie files and removable drives.</li>
<li>Improved UI: Icon looks correct now on Windows Vista</li>
<li>Promotional feature: Added fully optional shortcuts to eBay during the installation. Simply untick “eBay shortcuts” in the choose components page during install if you do not wish to have those.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks Pkboy</p>
<p>PS: I did not make or improve this product i just found it on <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.google.com</a> and i wanted to share it with you guys</p>
