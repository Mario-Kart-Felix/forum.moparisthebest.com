    <description>[u]Server Info[/u]

[317 Revision]
[DeltaScape Source and NonRenamed Client]

All in all, the combat is shit (Delta) and most skills work SOMEWHAT like they did in RuneScape. I need them working 100%

Needed: Thoughts and opinions on what needs to be completed first and foremost to create as close to the old RS experience as possible.

Staff positions will most likely be given to Closed Beta testers when Open Beta is released.
