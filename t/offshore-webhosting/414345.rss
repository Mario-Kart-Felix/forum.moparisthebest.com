    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/offshore-webhosting/414345</link>
    <description>Hello,

Was wondering what are some recommendations of Offshore Web hosting? I&#39;ve spent about a hour going through a lot of searches and some of them seem dumb and not private as well as me having confidence in them.

So I need some suggestions please!</description>

<p>I see your point, but we’d rather not have total anarchy here. We do what we think it best for the community, and keeping it clean is a big part.

<p>That is completely understandable, thank you for explaining the reasoning behind this rule. The site previously mentioned is not ‘trash’ as its a very stereotypical view that the site is based on 'hacking. Yes, hacking did make the site popular and there is a lot of information available on it but there are MANY useful things on that site. I have learned a lot from that site, I have also learned how people cause damage to other peoples system(s) which has taught me what to watch out for/avoid etc.<br>
That is true, but this is a completely different context however I can assume the reasoning behind banning the right to discuss certain topics/site(s) as it may teach people how to cause harm which they may attempt to use on this site which is a valid point.</p>

              <p>Apparently you can’t have a rational debate on these forum’s without flaming. If you want me to flame back please continue.<br>
I wasn’t ‘whining’, I was stating facts. By enforcing that rule the staff at this site are being oppressive. But it seems people lack the basic understanding of English would either not understand or jump to the conclusion that I was ‘whining’.<br>
Basically cause I really cbf treating yous like rational human beings cause for the most part yous are not acting like it. I stated a point and yous are assuming I was complaining, if I was complaining I would have inboxed David and been discreet about the matter.<br>
BUT as I wasn’t that bothered about censorship I just stated my dismay and then it escalated. So pl0x stop replying unless you have valid points to state because so far I have just seen ‘stupid’ replies for the most part.</p>

Jamie, I’m trying to have a logical debate (not argument) with David. If you wish to join in feel free but think before you type please as I never said he couldn’t punish/condemn me so what you just said was completely irrelevant. Also, by saying that statement you clearly made the foolish calculation that I don’t know that staff can regulate the forum’s in the mannerism they deem fit that doesn’t break the rules of their contract.<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/david">@David</a>. Ah okay. I don’t care if you care? I care about the fact that whoever made that rule is directly being oppressive to the members of this community by censoring things. I am telling you from a logical view point, if you can find a way to tell me that I am wrong please do as I always like examining any correction(s) I have made so I may not make them again in the future. The murder part was irrelevant and inappropriate, I could of used examples to do with communism, slavery, kleptocracy, dictatorship(s) etc but I chose not to as that would be not in proportion to the topic at hand.<br>

              <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Was wondering what are some recommendations of Offshore Web hosting? I’ve spent about a hour going through a lot of searches and some of them seem dumb and not private as well as me having confidence in them.</p>
<p>So I need some suggestions please!</p>
