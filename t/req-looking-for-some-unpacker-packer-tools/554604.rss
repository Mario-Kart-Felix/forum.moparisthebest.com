    <title>(REQ) Looking for some unpacker/packer tools</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-looking-for-some-unpacker-packer-tools/554604</link>
    <description>Most tools that have been released have dead links. 
I&#39;m looking to duplicate some existing items and npc&#39;s, I&#39;m in need for certain custom configs that i cant find on config dumps.
And ofcourse when i add in these items/npc&#39;s i want to pack them back into the cache.

Would really appreaciate it, if someone has some old tools/methods for this.</description>
