    <description>Okay let&#39;s see here, I have abooutt, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 six, six problems. I am hoping this will turn into a mass thread that I can keep checking off problems as we go, but, let&#39;s get started.
[u]                                                                                                                                                                                               [/u]
[size=12pt][i]Problem one:[/i][/size]

So, I have gotten all of the objects in CastleWars to work except for two of the important ones. Number one is the [size=10pt]trapdoors[/size] outside in the middle of the map. I have added this into my CastleWarsObjects.java to try to make them work.

[code]            case 1568:
                if (x == 2399 &amp;&amp; y == 3099) {
                    c.getPA().movePlayer(2399, 9500, 0);
                } else {
                    c.getPA().movePlayer(2400, 9507, 0);
                }
				break;[/code]

But for some reason, they just won&#39;t work, I have even tried adding a different type of trapdoor into that same position, but they still wouldn&#39;t work.
[u]                                                                                                                                                                                               [/u]
Now for the last object that won&#39;t work.

It&#39;s the Saradomin staircase, you can up, but you can&#39;t come down.

Here is what I have in CastleWarobjects.java

[code]            case 4419:
                if (x == 2417 &amp;&amp; y == 3074 &amp;&amp; c.heightLevel == 0) {
                    if (c.getX() &gt;= 2416 &amp;&amp; c.getX() &lt;= 2414) {
                        c.getPA().movePlayer(2417, 3077, 0);
                    } else {
                        c.getPA().movePlayer(2416, 3074, 0);
                    }
                }
                break;[/code]

But it still won&#39;t work. I made sure the coords were right, and that the c.getX &gt;= 2416 stuff was correct

[i][size=12pt]Problem two:[/size][/i]

This one is short. Okay so, whenever you log out in the waiting room, it will take your stuff away from you and bring you out of the waiting room, but if you just exit out of the client before logging out, it keeps you in the waiting room, and lets you keep your stuff. How do I make it so that whenever someone exits out of the client, it takes away their CastleWar items??

[i][size=12pt]Problem three:[/size][/i]

Another simple one. Whenever you attack someone in the game, it skulls you, how do I make it so that you don&#39;t skull, I added this to PlayerAssistant to try to fix it,

[code]if (!CastleWars.isInCw(c) &amp;&amp; c.duelStatus &lt;= 4 &amp;&amp; !c.getPA().inPitsWait() &amp;&amp; !c.getPA().isOwner() &amp;&amp; !c.getPA().isAdmin() &amp;&amp; !c.getPA().isHidden() &amp;&amp; !c.inPits &amp;&amp; !c.inFightCaves()) { // if we are not in a duel we must be in wildy so remove items
					c.getItems().resetKeepItems();
					c.isSkulled = false;
					c.skullTimer = 0;[/code]

But nothing, any ideas?

[i][size=12pt]Problem four:[/size][/i]

Okay this one will be probably the trickiest of all. The barricades work, but you can&#39;t attack them and it lets you add as many as you want, also you can use them to glitch through things. So here is where I think I need to edit to make it so that I can attack the barricades.

[code]		if(itemId == 4053) {
			c.getItems().deleteItem(4053,c.getItems().getItemSlot(4053),1);
			new Object(4421,  c.absX, c.absY, c.heightLevel, 0, 10, 4421, 1);
			//Server.npcHandler.spawnNpc2(1532, c.absX, c.absY, 0, 0,200,0,0,100);
        if (Region.getClipping(c.getX() - 1, c.getY(), c.heightLevel, -1, 0)) {
            c.getPA().walkTo(-1, 0);
        } else if (Region.getClipping(c.getX() + 1, c.getY(), c.heightLevel, 1, 0)) {
            c.getPA().walkTo(1, 0);
        } else if (Region.getClipping(c.getX(), c.getY() - 1, c.heightLevel, 0, -1)) {
            c.getPA().walkTo(0, -1);
        } else if (Region.getClipping(c.getX(), c.getY() + 1, c.heightLevel, 0, 1)) {
            c.getPA().walkTo(0, 1);
        }
			c.sendMessage(&quot;You setup a barricade.&quot;);
		}[/code]

I&#39;m not sure how I can edit that to make it so that you can attack the barricades.
[u]                                                                                                                                                                                               [/u]
Also, you can add as many as you could ever dream of. I added this to try to prevent that, but nothing.

[code]	public static void addBarricade(int x, int y, int z) {
		if (existingBarricade(x,y,z)) {
			return;
		}
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; b.length; i++) {
			if (b[i][0] &lt; 1 &amp;&amp; b[i][1] &lt; 1 &amp;&amp; b[i][2] &lt; 1) {
				b[i][0] = x;
				b[i][1] = y;
				b[i][2] = z;
				return;
			}
		}
		c.sendMessage(&quot;Could not add barricade as there is too many.&quot;); //change to sendmessage
	}[/code]

Any ideas?
[u]                                                                                                                                                                                               [/u]
Another problem with the barricades, is that you can use them to glitch through things, such as the opponents spawn room. I tried to make it so that whenever you add a barricade, it moves you one position away, but now people can glitch into spawn areas. How can I make it so that whenever you add a barricade, it adds one space ahead of you, and not under you?

[i][size=12pt]Problem five:[/size][/i]
Okay so I tried to add a custom interface to my castle wars, but I can&#39;t get the timer to appear next to it, everytime I try, it glitches me out of CastleWars, how should I change this method to make it appear?

[code]    public static void updatePlayers() {
        Iterator iterator = waitingRoom.keySet().iterator();
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            Client player = (Client) iterator.next();
			int team = waitingRoom.get(player);
            if (player != null) {
				player.getPA().walkableInterface(5730);
				//c.getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;Time Until Next Game Starts: &quot; + ((gameStartTimer * 3) + (timeRemaining * 3)) + &quot; seconds.&quot;, 6570);
				}
            }
        }[/code]

Whenever the timer doesn&#39;t have the slashes in front of it, it kills the server once anyone steps into the waiting room. Any ideas??

[size=12pt][i]Problem six:[/i][/size]

Okay, this one will also be a toughy

For the mining in the caves, it only lets you mine each rock on a specific side, so for one pair of rocks, you can mine it on the front side, and for another only the back, how can I fix this. This is in my actionhandler.java

[code]		case 4437: //castlewars
			c.mining[0] = 0;
			c.mining[1] = 0;
			c.mining[2] = 0;
			c.getMining().startMining(c.mining[0], c.mining[1], c.mining[2]);
			new Object(4439, c.objectX, c.objectY, c.heightLevel, 0, 10, 4439, 1);
		break;[/code]

That&#39;s all for today folks.

Thanks for reading! Please help me out, took me forever to make this thread :P

              <p>Okay let’s see here, I have abooutt, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 six, six problems. I am hoping this will turn into a mass thread that I can keep checking off problems as we go, but, let’s get started.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">                                                                                                                                                                                               </span><br>
[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-i">Problem one:</span>[/size]</p>
<p>So, I have gotten all of the objects in CastleWars to work except for two of the important ones. Number one is the [size=10pt]trapdoors[/size] outside in the middle of the map. I have added this into my CastleWarsObjects.java to try to make them work.</p>
<p><code>            case 1568:
                if (x == 2399 &amp;&amp; y == 3099) {
                    c.getPA().movePlayer(2399, 9500, 0);
                } else {
                    c.getPA().movePlayer(2400, 9507, 0);
                }
				break;</code></p>
<p>But for some reason, they just won’t work, I have even tried adding a different type of trapdoor into that same position, but they still wouldn’t work.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">                                                                                                                                                                                               </span><br>
Now for the last object that won’t work.</p>
<p>It’s the Saradomin staircase, you can up, but you can’t come down.</p>
<p><img src="http://oi43.tinypic.com/1ny05g.jpg" alt width="293" height="246"></p>
<p>Here is what I have in CastleWarobjects.java</p>
<p><code>            case 4419:
                if (x == 2417 &amp;&amp; y == 3074 &amp;&amp; c.heightLevel == 0) {
                    if (c.getX() &gt;= 2416 &amp;&amp; c.getX() &lt;= 2414) {
                        c.getPA().movePlayer(2417, 3077, 0);
                    } else {
                        c.getPA().movePlayer(2416, 3074, 0);
                    }
                }
                break;</code></p>
<p>But it still won’t work. I made sure the coords were right, and that the c.getX &gt;= 2416 stuff was correct</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=12pt]Problem two:[/size]</span></p>
<p>This one is short. Okay so, whenever you log out in the waiting room, it will take your stuff away from you and bring you out of the waiting room, but if you just exit out of the client before logging out, it keeps you in the waiting room, and lets you keep your stuff. How do I make it so that whenever someone exits out of the client, it takes away their CastleWar items??</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=12pt]Problem three:[/size]</span></p>
<p>Another simple one. Whenever you attack someone in the game, it skulls you, how do I make it so that you don’t skull, I added this to PlayerAssistant to try to fix it,</p>
<p><code>if (!CastleWars.isInCw(c) &amp;&amp; c.duelStatus &lt;= 4 &amp;&amp; !c.getPA().inPitsWait() &amp;&amp; !c.getPA().isOwner() &amp;&amp; !c.getPA().isAdmin() &amp;&amp; !c.getPA().isHidden() &amp;&amp; !c.inPits &amp;&amp; !c.inFightCaves()) { // if we are not in a duel we must be in wildy so remove items
					c.getItems().resetKeepItems();
					c.isSkulled = false;
					c.skullTimer = 0;</code></p>
<p>But nothing, any ideas?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=12pt]Problem four:[/size]</span></p>
<p>Okay this one will be probably the trickiest of all. The barricades work, but you can’t attack them and it lets you add as many as you want, also you can use them to glitch through things. So here is where I think I need to edit to make it so that I can attack the barricades.</p>
<p><code>		if(itemId == 4053) {
			c.getItems().deleteItem(4053,c.getItems().getItemSlot(4053),1);
			new Object(4421,  c.absX, c.absY, c.heightLevel, 0, 10, 4421, 1);
			//Server.npcHandler.spawnNpc2(1532, c.absX, c.absY, 0, 0,200,0,0,100);
        if (Region.getClipping(c.getX() - 1, c.getY(), c.heightLevel, -1, 0)) {
            c.getPA().walkTo(-1, 0);
        } else if (Region.getClipping(c.getX() + 1, c.getY(), c.heightLevel, 1, 0)) {
            c.getPA().walkTo(1, 0);
        } else if (Region.getClipping(c.getX(), c.getY() - 1, c.heightLevel, 0, -1)) {
            c.getPA().walkTo(0, -1);
        } else if (Region.getClipping(c.getX(), c.getY() + 1, c.heightLevel, 0, 1)) {
            c.getPA().walkTo(0, 1);
        }
			c.sendMessage("You setup a barricade.");
		}</code></p>
<p>I’m not sure how I can edit that to make it so that you can attack the barricades.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">                                                                                                                                                                                               </span><br>
Also, you can add as many as you could ever dream of. I added this to try to prevent that, but nothing.</p>
<p><code>	public static void addBarricade(int x, int y, int z) {
		if (existingBarricade(x,y,z)) {
			return;
		}
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; b.length; i++) {
			if (b[i][0] &lt; 1 &amp;&amp; b[i][1] &lt; 1 &amp;&amp; b[i][2] &lt; 1) {
				b[i][0] = x;
				b[i][1] = y;
				b[i][2] = z;
				return;
			}
		}
		c.sendMessage("Could not add barricade as there is too many."); //change to sendmessage
	}</code></p>
<p>Any ideas?<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">                                                                                                                                                                                               </span><br>
Another problem with the barricades, is that you can use them to glitch through things, such as the opponents spawn room. I tried to make it so that whenever you add a barricade, it moves you one position away, but now people can glitch into spawn areas. How can I make it so that whenever you add a barricade, it adds one space ahead of you, and not under you?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=12pt]Problem five:[/size]</span><br>
Okay so I tried to add a custom interface to my castle wars, but I can’t get the timer to appear next to it, everytime I try, it glitches me out of CastleWars, how should I change this method to make it appear?</p>
<p><code>    public static void updatePlayers() {
        Iterator iterator = waitingRoom.keySet().iterator();
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            Client player = (Client) iterator.next();
			int team = waitingRoom.get(player);
            if (player != null) {
				player.getPA().walkableInterface(5730);
				//c.getPA().sendFrame126("Time Until Next Game Starts: " + ((gameStartTimer * 3) + (timeRemaining * 3)) + " seconds.", 6570);
				}
            }
        }</code></p>
<p>Whenever the timer doesn’t have the slashes in front of it, it kills the server once anyone steps into the waiting room. Any ideas??</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-i">Problem six:</span>[/size]</p>
<p>Okay, this one will also be a toughy</p>
<p>For the mining in the caves, it only lets you mine each rock on a specific side, so for one pair of rocks, you can mine it on the front side, and for another only the back, how can I fix this. This is in my actionhandler.java</p>
<p><code>		case 4437: //castlewars
			c.mining[0] = 0;
			c.mining[1] = 0;
			c.mining[2] = 0;
			c.getMining().startMining(c.mining[0], c.mining[1], c.mining[2]);
			new Object(4439, c.objectX, c.objectY, c.heightLevel, 0, 10, 4439, 1);
		break;</code></p>
<p>That’s all for today folks.</p>
