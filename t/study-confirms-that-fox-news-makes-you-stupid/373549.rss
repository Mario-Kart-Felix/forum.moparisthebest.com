<p>I can agree they do appear to be heavily biased but at first glance with good reason, the study showed that in cases people who watched more of fox news than/and less of other news stations that they appeared to be more misinformed, similar story with MSNBC PBS and the other stations(sorry I forgot their names  :o) but to a lesser extent.</p>

But goes nowhere of saying that CNN, or MSNBC are blatanyly dishonest (even though they "fared only slightly better")
<p>Sample size is everything and im assuming they took it from around the area where the college is. I don’t trust any surveys unless the same size in near the 100,000’s. You cant find out how many people answered the survey dishonestly.</p>
<p>Maybe they should ask questions such as:<br>
Did you answer this survey honestly?<br>
Are you sure of where the information came from?</p>
<p>Im sorry, I’d try and spend more time arguing but I don’t have enough motivation to argue with someone on the internet for an extended period of time. When I know they will never admit they are wrong even if they are, and I will never admit I am wrong even if I am.</p>

<p>If you’re going to bash ‘liberal news outlets’ for being intellectually dishonest then don’t do the same thing, the percentage of USA’s population is irrelevant as it was voters who were questioned(about 0.001% but that is also largely irrelevant), not the general public.</p>

<p>[quote=“mwiebelhaus, post:8, topic:373549”]Bottom-line people just guessed on the survey because they didnt listen closely enough to the news program that was infact telling the truthful information and most of those questions can go ethie way depending on what research you are looking at.</p>

<p>Oh christ grow up, you took this opportunity to ignore the survey and bash those liberal news outlets for not including all relevant information(when in fact the only thing the link OP posted was missing was the number of people questioned) and you’re best defense against the survey is that the people questioned didn’t REALLY listen to the news? I can’t decide what’s more disturbing, what you just said or the figures in the poll suggesting 9 out of 10 people questioned think that <span class="bbcode-b">they encountered misleading information</span>, with 56% thinking <span class="bbcode-b">that misleading information occurred frequently</span> and 54% thinking it was more frequent than previous elections.

<p>But they were, what you see is fox news bashing, what I see is the poll suggests the biggest number of reports of misinformation was from those who watched less news than others which seems completely valid and expected, however in some cases those who watched fox news were misinformed on various topics and to a lesser extent the same thing with those who watched msnbc npr pbs etc.</p>

<p>Seeing that the heads of these agencies were all appointed by the president. The truth is nobody will ever know forsure, it is so easy to counterfeit documents so you can either trust him when he says that he was born here, or you can always have the doubt in your mind that he might not have been.</p>
