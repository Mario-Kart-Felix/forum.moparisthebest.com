&lt;blockquote&gt;Philip Chawner, 53, and his 57-year-old wife Audrey weigh 24st. Their daughter Emma, 19, weighs 17st, while her older sister Samantha, 21, weighs 18st.

The family from Blackburn claim £22,508 a year in benefits, equivalent to the take-home pay from a £30,000 salary.

The Chawners, haven&#39;t worked in 11 years, claim their weight is a hereditary condition and the money they receive is insufficient to live on.

Mr Chawner said: &quot;What we get barely covers the bills and puts food on the table. It&#39;s not our fault we can&#39;t work. We deserve more.&quot;

The family claim to spend £50 a week on food and consume 3,000 calories each a day. The recommended maximum intake is 2,000 for women and 2,500 for men.

&quot;We have cereal for breakfast, bacon butties for lunch and microwave pies with mashed potato or chips for dinner,&quot; Mrs Chawner told Closer magazine.

&quot;All that healthy food, like fruit and veg, is too expensive. We&#39;re fat because it&#39;s in our genes. Our whole family is overweight,&quot; she added.

Each week, Mr and Mrs Chawner, who have been married for 23 years, receive £177 in income support and incapacity benefit. Mrs Chawner is paid an extra £330-a-month disability allowance for epilepsy and asthma, both a result of being overweight.

Mr Chawner gets £71 a month after developing Type 2 diabetes because of his size. He was on a waiting list for a gastric band last year, but a heart condition made the operation unsuitable. Their daughter Samantha receives £84 in Jobseekers&#39; Allowance each fortnight while Emma, who is training to be a hairdresser, gets £58 every two weeks under a hardship fund for low-income students.

Emma, said: &quot;I&#39;m a student and don&#39;t have time to exercise&quot; she said &quot;We all want to lose weight to stop the abuse we get in the street, but we don&#39;t know how.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now we know why they were forcing the blonde one on the right into xfactor, despite the fact she couldn&#39;t sing.</description>
