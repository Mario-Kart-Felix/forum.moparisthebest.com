    <description>Sorry if this is in the Wrong section, i didnt know were else to post...

Hey Moparscape I started a server a few weeks ago Knowing nothing about java, I still dont know much but i get by :P
I downloaded my source from Ifailatcoding, but everyone claimed that his source had viruses and whatever but i never go any so whatever :D

any ways my server features are 

* Working Skill Cape emotes
*Torva
*Primal
*D claws (Special works)
*All godsword (with spec)
* Home is Edgeville (I know alot of servers use this home but i really like it :P)
*NPC vendors all around the home 
* Has a custom minigame at home as well
*custom quest tab interface, Shows amount of player, PC points, PK points and the slayer task.
*and yes of course we have a pk point system
* The server also load 525 Graphics... It has moving whip!! LOL

(sorry for the fail list of features i dont really know how to post properly, this is my first ALMOST good post lol)
