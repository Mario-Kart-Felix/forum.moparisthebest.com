    <description>Stop trying to sell my source you fucking retards.  Any money gained off it should go straight to me anyway for wasting 2 weeks of my life coding it.  All you did was dl and once it was removed you think you&#39;re the only one with it.  Whatever, just stop trying to profit off of other people work or else I&#39;ll re-release it for everyone to use.
[center][img]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/Themes/default/images/warnmute.gif[/img] Releasing something only to withdraw the release is silly. Besides, once something enters the public domain it should stay that way.
If you don&#39;t like people selling your toy (which staff cannot prevent if it isn&#39;t done on this website) then actually re-release it, rather than winging.[/center]</description>
