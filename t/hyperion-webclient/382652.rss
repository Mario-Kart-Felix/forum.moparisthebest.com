    <title>Hyperion Webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hyperion-webclient/382652</link>
    <description>Im almost finished with the webclient (i think) and im at the point were i get mixed up with EVERY single webclient; jarring, signing, and cache zipping. so im left with these questions:

1. When i jar my client, it deletes java folders, but it also gets rid of the config.cfg, which is needed to load the clients name (Whatever this is, thats what it says on almost everything, like loading screens, login screens, etc.), the ip, and the port. [Fixed]

I tried adding an exception for .cfg files in jarmaker, but it doesnt work, can someone help me with that, kind of confused..?

2. When zipping the cache, i just make a zip file, and drag the contents in, right?


3. signing, i think i understand, but sometimes i have a problem with the signature of the webclient.

4. Whenever i set the manifest template to &quot;client&quot; it cannot find it, that i dont understand... [Fixed]
Thanks guys.
4b. I just found out when i opened my jar with winrar, there were NO class files at ALL in the jar file, i checked the jarmaker console, and it showed no class files being packed into the jarmaker.. this is weird.... [Fixed]

i put the java files etc in there manually, but it doesnt give me the &quot;cannot find client&quot; error, but now it just doesnt load up, would i need to sign it? I tried turning off my security first then doing it too, it didnt work..</description>
