Hello Guys and Gals, this is Tyler.

I&#39;m here to inform you that I have a RSPS, that is back online. Some people may know of it, but many may not. The Server is called FreedomScape. FreedomScape is the newest server name, it was changed due to the last server name, not many liked so I changed it. So for those that is concerned. But FreedomScape is a RuneScape Private Server. Back in the day it wasn&#39;t as popular to many people. But as you may know, RitzScape, it is similar to RitzScape but it has my own updates and some extra stuff. Not to make to could amazing or anything, but it is a really good server. I have had people online doing beta testing and such. Most bugs have been fixed. Some suggestions have been accepted, still being accepted.

FreedomScape is just a little server to play in your free time, enjoy the game, and meet new people.

Why you should play this server?

I&#39;m not telling you to play this server, I&#39;m just suggesting it. It is totally up to you. All i recommend is that you give it a try, better to try and not like it than to not know if you like it or not. Up to you. If so read the section below. Maybe I&#39;ll see you around.  

-------------------------------

Go to the website that will be located below this paragraph, Sign up and become a member so I have an estimate of players that would to be apart of the community. At the website below you will be able to get a lot of updates and information.


-------------------------------

Client problems:

If you get something like this when you run the client:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: client : Unsu
pported major.minor version 51.0
at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)
at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassCond(Unknown Source)
at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(Unknown Source)

at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source)
at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source)
at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source)
Could not find the main class: client. Program will exit.
Press any key to continue . . .&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All you have to do is download the latest version of Java,
because it uses the latest version I have used. 
If have problems just send me a message to my email:
