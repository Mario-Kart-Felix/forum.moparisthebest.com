    <description>So I&#39;m basicly thinking about starting a medieval Server with lots and lots of quests. 
It has to be like a fairy tale with castles etc. 
The better armour is gunna be mithril. 
Adamant/Rune/Barrows/dragon armour can be earned by completing a story line of a city (example: Camelot). 
The last quest is -obviously- gunna be a very hard quest. 
I&#39;ll also implent more story lines, like one for skillers, one for pkers and one for mains. (3/4 of the quests will be the same, other quests will be edited so your type of account can do it -with some challenge-)

So my question is: 
What source/client should I use to make quests/stable server?
PI?
Delta? Never used (is it worth the time to geting used to it?)
Hyperion?
Shard?
Apollo?
508?
634? (No more higher)

And if you got ideas or want to help me making this server, feel free to post it underneath :)

Hyperion design sucks<br>
Apollo is bloated with unneeded features that are confusing<br>
Rune-Source has no features at all and is extremely flat</p>
<p>ScapeEmu is good. Missing a lot but good.<br>

Looks like a good framework.</p>

              <p>The big three currently are Hyperion, Rune-source, and Apollo. these three servers each have their own strengths and weaknesses and each come with a decently large amount of users. PI and Delta are terrible from a performance perspective, while Hyperion, Apollo, and Rune-source are all very clean compared to PI and Delta so you will have to do a much large amount of programming to get a well rounded amount of content for your player base.</p>
