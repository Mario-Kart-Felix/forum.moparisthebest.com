    <description>HEY, For awhile now ive wanted to host, code, and run a rsps.  Preferably dodian if I can.  I love the old school nustolgic and I used to code for one, but dont remember how I was able to.  Ive never run a servee before but I think I got the portforwarding down.  Classpath, and paths are set.  Im using Windows vista.  If anyone can TEAMVIEW with me asap I would certainly appreciate seeinf and learning to do this watching another do so or help figure some kimks out!

              <p>I suppose, all I need, realy.  Is a good Java 32 bit for Windows vista.  That works with alot of servers usualy.  Usualy seems to be my problem, or maybe im not putting a code in the server edit correct.  Also, im just not sure if I portforwarded right.  I mean, I can’t even get on a mopar server with basic ip.</p>
