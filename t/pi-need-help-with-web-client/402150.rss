              <p>They need to reply so people can correct any mistakes and work together to solve it. That would be a lot better. So I’m not PMing I’m replying. What I would do is download a webclient ready project insanity base. then i would look up a video on how to use JAR Maker on rsps. after you make the .jar add this to your website for the game:</p>
<p>a</p>

<p>replace client.jar with the direct download link of your servers client.jar. if you have any other problems you should start a new thread because they will be about something else. I would use [PI] Lost Legacy the only problem with that server is that you will have to manually download the cache and put it in your c drive folder bc if u dont it doesnt download right from the client for some reason im still trying to fix that.</p>
<p>If you need the code for the whole page heres something I just html coded for you:</p>
<p>[code]</p>


YourServerNameHere


Welcome to the official website of YourServerNameHere. The owner is: OwnerNameHere. Play the webclient below. If there are any problems report them to this email: YourEmail. Thanks for choosing YourServerNameHere. Enjoy!



Click<a>here</a>to download the client.
<br>
There might be an error box with no game background that says: "Error Connecting, Please report.". If that happens then download <a>this</a> and put it in the C drive folder in My Computer/Computer.

[/code]
<p>if you want to make that into your website you can use <a href="http://webs.com" rel="nofollow noopener">webs.com</a> with html file hosting mode. make sure you name it index.html when you save the page there.</p>
