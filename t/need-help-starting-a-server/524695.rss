    <title>[Need Help] Starting a server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-starting-a-server/524695</link>
    <description>Me and a friend have decided we want to create and run our own rsps. The only problem we have is that we don&#39;t have a clear understanding on how to get the server up and running. We also need a coder to help, since we have no experience in coding as-well. We have a good understanding on how to run a website since we have many times before, we also can do a little gfx, but if you&#39;re really experienced in gfx and want to help out you are free too. We can also afford the vps for the server. If you are interested in helping us out, you can add me on skype @ imvhizi.
