    <title>[Cheezscape Based 317] need server help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cheezscape-based-317-need-server-help/362731</link>
    <description>ok, im running a cheezscape based 317 atm and it runs off of hamachi network because i dont have a router atm i blew it up. anyways id like someone to try and log onto my webclient and see if you can...

1. do it without using hamachi (i dont think so)
2. talk and chat and see how laggy it is.
3. see if you can even connect to the server.

if you are interested in helping me PM me and have about 30mins to spare. 

you will be rewarded...your choice of a reward.</description>
