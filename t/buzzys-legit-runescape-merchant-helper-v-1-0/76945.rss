This program is used for merchants who are constantly buying or selling items. It has a user friendly interface, which can help a lot. I will update if I get feedback on quality and suggestions. I came up with this idea a long time ago and made some short beta versions of it. This was written in Basic. For those who say this is a simply coded program, why didn&#39;t you make it then?

The program works like this, a menu comes up and asks you whether you are buying, or selling.

In the selling choice the program asks what you are selling, and how much you are selling it for. Then, with your input of how much someone is about to buy, it calculates in a blink how much they should be putting up, no longer will you have to take time to calculate, and risk losing the sale.

The buying interface works pretty much the same way, it asks you what you are buying, and how much you are buying it for. I think that this one is a lot more useful. Say you are buying 10k lobs, for 225ea, and someone tries to sell you 537, they&#39;re going to want fast selling, and this program can tell you how much money your going to need as fast as you can type 537 =).

Heres Some Screenies:
