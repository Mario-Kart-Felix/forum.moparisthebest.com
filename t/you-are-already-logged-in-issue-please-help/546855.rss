    <description>i just downlaoded moparscape today and so far i have tried everything that i have seen to get this to work.

i just want to play from the local hosted server. i go to start server and start the server. that works fine. then i go to login with any random account. even like sdjnfkerng. but its always telling me that im already logged in. has anyone else had this issue and if so what did you go to fix it? thanks guys 

i have read something about using another client or whatever but i cant figure out how to make a local server to play on when i do that any help is greatly appriciated</description>
