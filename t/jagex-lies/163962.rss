    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagex-lies/163962</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;We are aware that many players will have strong opinions about this change, [b]and as the players of the game we value your opinion[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

well that is the biggest lie i have ever seen. Also i love how they make a topic in the rants section so they cant simply delete it in a day and not care what people posted in it.

So i know there are alot of topics about this but honestly i think rs is going downhill. I just want to know how many people think jagex is killing their own game.</description>

<p>well that is the biggest lie i have ever seen. Also i love how they make a topic in the rants section so they cant simply delete it in a day and not care what people posted in it.</p>
<p>So i know there are alot of topics about this but honestly i think rs is going downhill. I just want to know how many people think jagex is killing their own game.</p>
