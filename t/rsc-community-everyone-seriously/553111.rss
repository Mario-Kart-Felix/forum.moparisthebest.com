    <title>RSC Community. Everyone. Seriously</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsc-community-everyone-seriously/553111</link>
    <description>[i]Let&#39;s be honest, the RSC scene has been withering away for a long while and it has reached it&#39;s lowest state ever.  At the rate it&#39;s going who knows if there will be enough people around to call it a scene/community.  However, it CAN be fixed and the changes needed are the most difficult challenges to face, and they&#39;re not coding/development related... it&#39;s purely people related.  I&#39;ll try to make this brief.[/i]

There is one monumental problem and another which seems nearly trivial...

[b]1.  Multiple Servers Splitting the Community[/b]

With each server the RSC community becomes more separate, coincidentally splitting players apart.  Imagine logging ing and only 60 people are online, no one in the wild, everyone immensely spread out.  Oooooh that&#39;s right, you don&#39;t have to imagine it, for this is what is going on as we speak.  It is a desolate state and deters people from wanting to stay online.

For a moment, let&#39;s forget about the ing aspect.  Having a active forums is a vital and often overlooked aspect of any server.  Having an abundance of activity on forums brings a more attractive landscape to the potential player&#39;s eye, for forums is what they see first.  Even for those who already play, I&#39;m sure many will attest active, interesting forums makes you more willing to come back and look.  

Comb through RSC forums and you&#39;ll see countless adverts for servers.  Everyone wants to do it themselves, create their own masterpiece, which I wholeheartedly understand, but it&#39;s not what works.  Server owners combining together and forming one grand server, that is what works, it is what&#39;s necessary for RSC to survive.  It is [b]THE[/b] solution to player counts, to inactivity... it just needs everyone to look past themselves.
 
[b]2.  Mods inactivity[/b]

I&#39;ve been a mod for majority of the time I played, for Project RSC and RSCE and I admit near the end of watch I didn&#39;t come through for the community to the extent I should have.  When players need assistance they require the mods appointed to serve them.  With a larger server comes more mods and would help to greatly diminish player dissatisfaction regarding mod inactivity.  

[b]In Closing...[/b]

I realize this is one hell of a long shot, since there are server owners with gripes against one another.  You can establish &quot;heads at the table,&quot; if you will, to help fortify relationships and continuity.  This can work, you guys can make it happen.  (Create a voting system between y&#39;all-call it democracy).  You don&#39;t have to like someone to find success, or to do something for the betterment of a whole...just ask your coworker, or relative :P  Seriously tho, for the sake of the community, if server owners can put the game first and come together to create and manage the last great RSC server, it has a chance to flourish the way it damn should.

[b]This isn&#39;t about anyone one person, this about everyone.  We all play this game because we were too addicted to quit lol.  If we let it die, let it die because we beat the addiction, not because we beat it to death.[/b]</description>

there are people who won’t play emulation because of the history of how corrupt it has been.<br>
Some people won’t play revolution because of crooks and how corrupt he has been…</p>
<p>I feel both servers are doing what they need to do to stay alive. On one side people want pk supplies and want to pk, don’t care how it is introduced, admin spawning, etc…</p>
<p>On the other side, you have the original RSC die hards that want to train for a year to get enough pk supplies for a month. Which isn’t something anyone wants to do on RSCE…</p>
<p>They will never combine due to money, pride, and control.</p>

<p>Your attempt to get me to play “other servers,” yet some I’m not a grown up for wanting to enjoy RSC.  FYI, I only mod now.  Life is too busy to play the actual game for me.  Downside of being a grown-up, I suppose.</p>

              <p>Casey, the game was built on the same principals as Dungeons &amp; Dragons and look at where D&amp;D is at today, it has a huge player base with people still into the original game. Even arcade games get a shit ton of attention! So why can’t RSC? Just because the company who created it decided to fuck over all the players that made them popular doesn’t mean there can’t be a following, if “private”.</p>

Why bother caring?  Why bother even coming down to RSC forums?  Those are questions you can ask yourself.  You seem to think we’re wasting time wanting to keep it alive, but find yourself down here posting in the forums.  I’m not slighting you, but what’s the point in your post?</p>
<p>Furthermore, most of us do have fantastic lives, we choose to reminisce playing a game we enjoy.  We don’t care about the graphics… have you honestly never played something simply for the joy of it?</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-i">Let’s be honest, the RSC scene has been withering away for a long while and it has reached it’s lowest state ever.  At the rate it’s going who knows if there will be enough people around to call it a scene/community.  However, it CAN be fixed and the changes needed are the most difficult challenges to face, and they’re not coding/development related… it’s purely people related.  I’ll try to make this brief.</span></p>
<p>There is one monumental problem and another which seems nearly trivial…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1.  Multiple Servers Splitting the Community</span></p>
<p>With each server the RSC community becomes more separate, coincidentally splitting players apart.  Imagine logging ing and only 60 people are online, no one in the wild, everyone immensely spread out.  Oooooh that’s right, you don’t have to imagine it, for this is what is going on as we speak.  It is a desolate state and deters people from wanting to stay online.</p>
<p>For a moment, let’s forget about the ing aspect.  Having a active forums is a vital and often overlooked aspect of any server.  Having an abundance of activity on forums brings a more attractive landscape to the potential player’s eye, for forums is what they see first.  Even for those who already play, I’m sure many will attest active, interesting forums makes you more willing to come back and look.</p>
<p>Comb through RSC forums and you’ll see countless adverts for servers.  Everyone wants to do it themselves, create their own masterpiece, which I wholeheartedly understand, but it’s not what works.  Server owners combining together and forming one grand server, that is what works, it is what’s necessary for RSC to survive.  It is <span class="bbcode-b">THE</span> solution to player counts, to inactivity… it just needs everyone to look past themselves.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2.  Mods inactivity</span></p>
<p>I’ve been a mod for majority of the time I played, for Project RSC and RSCE and I admit near the end of watch I didn’t come through for the community to the extent I should have.  When players need assistance they require the mods appointed to serve them.  With a larger server comes more mods and would help to greatly diminish player dissatisfaction regarding mod inactivity.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">In Closing…</span></p>
<p>I realize this is one hell of a long shot, since there are server owners with gripes against one another.  You can establish “heads at the table,” if you will, to help fortify relationships and continuity.  This can work, you guys can make it happen.  (Create a voting system between y’all-call it democracy).  You don’t have to like someone to find success, or to do something for the betterment of a whole…just ask your coworker, or relative <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  Seriously tho, for the sake of the community, if server owners can put the game first and come together to create and manage the last great RSC server, it has a chance to flourish the way it damn should.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">This isn’t about anyone one person, this about everyone.  We all play this game because we were too addicted to quit lol.  If we let it die, let it die because we beat the addiction, not because we beat it to death.</span></p>
