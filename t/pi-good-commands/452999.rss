    <title>[PI] Good commands?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-good-commands/452999</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t find very many good snippets for awesome commands. I need stuff that would be good for donors. Such as the ::qspk command. I&#39;d like primarily stuff that does unique anims and gfxs and benifits donors in many small ways. That way I can start giving benifits instead of riches for donations, that way my economy is even better. Or if you know of any good anims/gfx that aren&#39;t used by default that I could put into a command, I&#39;d like to know of that too. Yes I have a gfx list, but I want peoples opinions as well. Thank you. :)</description>
