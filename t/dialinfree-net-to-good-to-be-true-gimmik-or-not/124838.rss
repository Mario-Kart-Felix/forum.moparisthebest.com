   I live in michigan and i came accross dialinfree.net they say they are a free internet provider for the western part of michigan with a no-cost Free unlimited internet Accesss. They Have local number for my area So after a little thoght i Decided To try it out for a Few mins i was surprised, 
By how faster it is then my people pc connection I got Around 54.8kbs With it And i was wondering 
Is this internet service Really Free like juno Until they removed the Free Access number for my area Or is there charges involved with this service at www.dialinfree.net i looked around a little at the site and they have a paid service At around 12.98 a month i think and you get support with it The free Service offers no-free Support if you use the free service and you need help i think you have to pay $5 a Question.



 Please Tell me what you think of this and if it is a scam or not idk what to think and i really couldn&#39;t find anything On google or yahoo answers that really answer my questions.</description>
