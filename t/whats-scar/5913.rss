    <title>What&#39;s SCAR?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-scar/5913</link>
    <description>Sorry if this isn&#39;t the correct section for this question; there are just so many SCAR sections I didn&#39;t know which one to post such a simple question in. Anyway I was just hoping that someone could tell me what SCAR is, what it does, how safe it is, and how easily it can get you banned. Thanks.</description>

              <p>No, you can’t edit stats and/or dupe. There has only been 1 (maybe 2) things that have ever allowed you to dupe in real RS. (and those were all fixed by jagex and don’t work anymore) All other things that say they can dupe or edit stats are scams. There probably won’t be mass bans because bots (unlike scar) actually mess with the client, which in a good bot actually makes it less detectable, but if Jagex gets wind of it they will be able to detect it more easily. If you get a good script for SCAR, it will act like a human so (theoretically) JageX won’t be able to tell if you’re autoing. Your main concern will probably be from other players reporting (if you have a good script)</p>

              <p>Interesting. Does it just auto, or can it dupe and create items like one can in a private server? Also, do you think there will be mass bans of people who use SCAR as Jagex has done in the past to other macroers?</p>

              <p>SCAR is an autoing program for RuneScape.  It can do mostly anything, depending on what script you get. It’s probably the safest cheating program out right now, and it mostly depends on what script you use on the detectability.<br>
You can obtain it at <a href="http://dylock.net/scar" rel="nofollow noopener">dylock.net/scar</a></p>
<p>edit: and in case you were wondering what scripts are, they’re sort of a set of commands for SCAR. A script basically tells scar, for example “if you see a monster, then click on it and wait for it to die. Then take any good drops, check health, and repeat until you’re out of food.”</p>
<p>That’s the basic idea, although it’s not quite that simple.<br>
Here is a basic script I wrote in about 30 seconds:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">program Example;
procedure WriteStuff;
begin
SendKeysSilent('working script made by rabcarl')
wait(1000)
writeln('script finished, ending')
terminateScript;
end;
begin
WriteStuff;
end.</code></pre>
