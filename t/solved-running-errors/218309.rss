    <description>Thanks, those of you who weren&#39;t jerks and helped me instead of flamed me.

Technically, all of the images are taken from RuneScape. Not only is Jagex not accredited with their work, but they also have mentioned, numerous times, that you may not take any images from their site without their consent.</p>
<p>There are a myriad of reasons why private servers are illegal. If Jagex wanted to, they could simply suit you for the above. They wouldn’t even need to go into anymore details.</p>
<p>Now, should we go over some more copyright laws and how most private servers infringe on Jagex’s right? (The only, ONLY reason why Jagex does not suit, I bet, is because it would cost them a lot of time and money. Also, it brings them traffic, sometimes, for those who started on a private server and moved to RuneScape or those who got fired back up into playing that horrid game again.)<br>

No, private servers are not illegal. Modifying JaGex’s cache is, however.[/quote]</p>
