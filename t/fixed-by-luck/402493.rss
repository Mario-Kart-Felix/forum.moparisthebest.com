Press any key to continue . . .[/code]

I think that means the port is in use. Now I think that is what it means but I&#39;m not sure. And if that is what it means, I have no other things open except my antivirus doing a sweep. Could someone suggewst how to open that port? (yes I have portforwarded correctly cause it used to work) And one thing could you try for me. Can someone got to rsps-hq.com and tell me if it is up. Because it was working for me then all of a sudden it says internet  explorer cannot connect to webpage. If it is up then I have a major problem.

I tried to go to rsps-hq.com/playjokerscape or whatever and it wouldn&#39;t says internet explorer cannot display the webpage. I think it may be trying to contact the server through the port and since it never connected, it can&#39;t end it. I really need some help....

I also went to google.org and it says the same thing...it&#39;s like it won&#39;t connect to any site using port 43594. PLEASE HELP</description>
