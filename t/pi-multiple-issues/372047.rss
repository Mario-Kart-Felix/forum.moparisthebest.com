    <description>I&#39;m using Destination-pk a PI based source . It has a few errors i need help fixing.

1. Fishing is messed up a little you can fish but once you click somewhere else you move away and are still doing the fishing emote.

2. Woodcutting and mining is the exact same thing.

3. It seems the weapons have the correct stat bonuses but defensive is too effective i suppose it&#39;s hard as heck to hit some npcs / you hit really low with weapons like gses even though the correct str bonus is intact.

Thanks for your time!</description>
