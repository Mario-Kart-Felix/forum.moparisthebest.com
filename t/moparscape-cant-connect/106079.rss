<p>ok for the first problem you cant connect make sure your server or someone elses server is online and that you have connected to their hamachi if they have it available, make sure you have the correct port it should then work.</p>
<p>for the second problem close the browser and open it again by clicking on the internet explorer symbol and typing in the url again. works for me. hope i helped.</p>
