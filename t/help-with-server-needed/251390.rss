    <description>Whenever I try to run server it comes up saying

Starting pimpscape Server on 0.0.0.0:43594

I have phonescape source and have compiled and everything but it doesn&#39;t run properly.
Is there something with no-ip i have to do? or with a source file</description>

              <p>that starting … means your server is running on localhost atm…<br>
but<br>
if you want host it for public, then you should download no-ip update client, google it and if you are only login in localhost for testing your server, try log in with client that ip is setted to 127.0.0.1 and port 43594.</p>

You are no help. He is clearly a first time poster, and you have discouraged him.<br>
