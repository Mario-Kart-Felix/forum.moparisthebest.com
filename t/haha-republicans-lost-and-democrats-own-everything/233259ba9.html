Yes. Democrats have a majority in the House and it&amp;#39;s VERY close majority in the Senate. In the Senate, Democrats have 50% and Republicans have 49%, everybody is wai&amp;hellip;">

He’s most likely talking about the fact that the UN doesn’t do much for countries under mass killing regimes. The Saddam regime is just one example.<br>

He never said anything about a draft. Oh, and think about it… Firing a weapon at the middle east is a bad idea. It would be worse than Hiroshima and Nagasaki because 1. It’ll just anger people further. 2. Bombing the middle east would probably hurt Israel too. 3. It’s not government-condoned, bombing the place would only create more terrorists.</p>

        <p>“Actually it’s still his country. Why don’t you go to china and preach your little laws with the emperor.”</p>
<p>The People’s Republic of China is a communist-controlled country where they have little freedoms.</p>
<p>“I’d like to see what you think of their opinion when your head is on a stick.”</p>
<p>Even if I were killed, it would have been done covertly. They have concentration camps you know. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>“China is part of the UN too, you know?”</p>
<p>And your point is? I never excused China of any wrong-doing.</p>
<p>“Um it doesn’t matter who put him in power”</p>
<p>This is true, however, the U.S. still played a large part by supporting the Ba’ath party.</p>
<p>“it doesn’t even matter that the US and Iraq were allies”</p>
<p>When did I say they were ever allies?</p>
<p>“Just because someone put him in power does not mean they own that person and whatever territory he keeps.”</p>
<p>This is also true, however, illegitimate. He obtained power illegally.</p>
<p>“Defend ourselves? Are you fucking kidding? No American died when he gassed the curds.”</p>
<p>True, but let’s take a look at the Gulf War (which never really ended anyway, considering Saddam was totally negligent during the U.N. peace process. I might also add that, we never really declared war on Iraq. Some would argue war was already declared due to Saddam’s violations.)</p>
<p>The number of coalition wounded in combat seems to have been less than 1,000. However, as of the year 2000, 183,000 U.S. veterans of the Gulf War, more than a quarter of the U.S. troops who participated in the War, have been declared permanently disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs [1]. About 30% of the 700,000 men and women who served in U.S. forces in the Gulf War still suffer an array of serious symptoms whose causes are not fully understood [2].</p>
<p>"So why are you saying we “have a right to take up arms and defend ourselves”</p>
<p>If the country is hostile against the U.S. and our allies?</p>
<p>“Do you know why people went into the election in such a anti-republican way? Because of the Iraq war.”</p>
<p>Anti-Republican? It was a close race. The democrat strategy is insult, attack &amp; triumph. They have no real strategy for Iraq. All they are going to do these last two years is attack Bush and make him look unsuitable for the nation, which, trust me; will not gain any leverage for the democrats in the '08 election. The people do not want to hear of how much of a failure their leader is, they want to hear progress in Iraq, social policies as well as foreign policies. Will the democrats give them these things? Of course not. They’ll avoid it at all costs. JUST TO make the republican president look badly.</p>
<p>“If you still favor the iraq war, then I consider that unethical cause that’s our people dying there for no reason.”</p>
<p>How can you say such a thing? There is no reason? Are you blind? The impending civil war will be the immediate death of millions of people, and you say it’s not worth it?</p>
<p>“You really are fascist aren’t you?”</p>
<p>What? What does fascism have to do with this? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>“I was being radical to prove my point.”</p>
<p>Sorry, I failed to catch the sarcasm. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>“You’re saying it was the business of Canada and Britain to go and fight them?”</p>
<p>How about Israel? The Ba’athist rule of Iraq was radically socialist &amp; Islamic, hence the deaths of hundreds of thousands of secular Kurdish people in Southern Iraq. They would not conform to their radical belief, thus they die. Sad world isn’t it?</p>
<p>“Your ignorance is exponential. Bush admitted that there were no WMDs (nuclear weapons in their definition) and said intelligence failed.”</p>
<p>Could you back up this statement with a source? If what you say is true, then it invalidates my entire argument.</p>
<p>“Do you think Bush even gave a shit what the cost was?”</p>
<p>Considering the amount of money that pours into Iraq effects the people’s opinion of him, I’d say so.</p>
<p>“He thought he could just jump in there, take saddam down, everyone would be happy, and then we could get out.”</p>
<p>I’m sure everyone thought this.</p>
<p>“You are wrong. Look it up. Once again, Bush admitted it in public.”</p>
<p>He may have admitted to it, but intelligence does not lie, we have found mass stockpiles of Chemical weapons &amp; agents. It’s common fact. Perhaps it was not part of their original agenda, but it is still a smack in the face to those who don’t believe any good has come out of Iraq. Saddam was supposed to immediately dispose of all chemical weapons in accordance with the U.N., this just proves how negligent he really is.</p>
<p>You can’t ignore the global community, it keeps the world ticking, even if it is a wishy-washy organization.</p>
<p>“What the fuck? That doesn’t even make sense. Please prove your statements, don’t just rant about stuff you can’t back up.”</p>
<p>Here’s a good list of the U.N.'s failures. This list includes what I’m ranting about. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>"Other serious security failures include:</p>
<pre><code>* Failure to prevent the 1994 Rwandan genocide, which resulted in the killings of nearly a million people, due to the refusal of the security council members to approve any necessary military action.[21]
* Failure by MONUC (UNSC Resolution 1291) to effectively intervene during the Second Congo War, which claimed nearly five million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), 1998-2002 (with fighting reportedly continuing), and in carrying out and distributing humanitarian aid.
* Failure to intervene in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, despite the fact that the UN designated Srebrenica a "safe haven" for refugees and assigned 600 Dutch peacekeepers to protect it.
* Failure to successfully deliver food to starving people in Somalia; the food was instead usually seized by local warlords. A U.S./UN attempt to apprehend the warlords seizing these shipments resulted in the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu.
* Sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers. Peacekeepers from several nations have been repatriated from UN peacekeeping operations for sexually abusing and exploiting girls as young as 8 in a number of different peacekeeping missions. This abuse is ongoing despite many revelations and probes by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services.[22][23] A 2005 internal UN investigation found that sexual exploitation and abuse has been reported in at least five countries where UN peacekeepers have been deployed, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Burundi, Côte d'Ivoire, and Liberia. [27] The BBC carried a similar report, and also cited a member of the World Food Programme as an offender.[24]"

<p>“He doubled the deficit! We’re the biggest debtors in the entire world”</p>
<p>And, what reform plan do you have in mind that can fix this?</p>
<p>“??? We had foreign friends such as Canada, Mexico, Germany, France, and many more.”</p>
<p>Canada, again, Canada can’t not be our friend under NAFTA. They need us.</p>
<p>Mexico? Oh of course, their opposition to immigration reform is really helping us out. That’s their biggest source of income.</p>
<p>Germany? See NATO.</p>

 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO /ˈneɪtoʊ/; French: Organisation du traité de l'Atlantique nord; OTAN), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance between 29 North American and European countries. The organization implements the North Atlantic Treaty that was signed on 4 April 1949. NATO constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its independent member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. ...</p>

<p>France? See NATO.</p>
<p>“Ever since the Iraq war, a lot of people didn’t back up the US at first, so Bush openly called them names, etc.”</p>
<p>Where’s your source for this? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>“That pissed them off and Canada + Britain entered the war and Canada withdrew their soldiers”</p>
<p>Britain is still in Iraq.</p>
<p>“So far America has almost no foreign friends.”</p>
<p>Yes, we’re so anti-social. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningc164.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>“How would you like it if they brought back the draft,”</p>
<p>They don’t need to reinstate the draft, we have enough volunteer soldiers in Iraq. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>"and you would get sent there fighting the war and you can laugh at someone cutting off your balls. "</p>
<p>Such confrontations are highly rare, indeed, most warfare is now fought with suicide bombs, roadside bombs &amp; car bombs.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’d like to apologize for the sloppy format, your quoting system confuses me greatly. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningc164.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
