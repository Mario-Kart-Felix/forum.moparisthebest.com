<p>No doubts there, of course Saddam committed many crimes in the past.  But it was in the past.  Making him accountable for his acts was never the issue, it was going into Iraq under false pretenses.  We went in because of threats of weapons of mass destruction and involvement with 9/11, not because he was a bad person.  Why not get UN assistance to have his regime overthrown and let him be tried by the international court?  The UN only refused to invade because of insufficient evidence of WMD’s…so I don’t disagree that he should be hanged, just the way we went about doing it.</p>

<p>Yes. Democrats have a majority in the House and it’s VERY close majority in the Senate. In the Senate, Democrats have 50% and Republicans have 49%, everybody is waiting on that last percent.</p>
<p>Finally the Bush Humon Torture act (The act doesn’t have a name so I just call it that), can be rejected hopefully. The Patriot act can go fuck itself and Bush won’t be able to take away any more of our rights (hopefully). Just two more years… just two more years. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyc164.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>If anyone wants to read about the Bush Human Torture act I was talking about. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/opinion/28thu1.html?ei=5088&amp;en=3eb3b23c27944ff9&amp;ex=1317096000&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1163030486" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Refer to this article.</a></p>
<p>If anyone wants to argue what the <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/hr3162.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">patriot act</a> <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> does, read the act and see what it does first. Oh by the way, it’s called the patriot act, so that if any one is against it, then they are supposively unpatriotic. Fuck them if you think so. Anyone not against this law is unpatriotic and a terrorist (someone causing terror. You don’t have to be blowing up bombs to cause terror).</p>

So you think it’s ok to take someone away for any reason no matter what it is? Turn off Fox News and wake up. If you don’t believe in civil rights, then you sir are a terrorist and I won’t even bother reading whatever you say. I don’t want to be contaminated with bubble scum.</p>

Saddam can do whatever he wants. It’s his country. We have no right to go into another man’s home and tell him what to do. Who the fuck died and left America in charge?

<p>Im going to have to disagree with you there ron. Even though i dont live in US i still know that saddam was a crazy and relentless torturer. He is not getting hanged because we invaded his country. He is getting hanged because he murdered 100s of people. They have found torture chambers with live cables hanging from the ceilings. Ready to shock the crap out of some civilian.</p>

<p>Again, it was not our business. He didn’t have nuclear weapons. Him gassing the curds didn’t have anything to do with us. We just pretended that we felt bad for them just to get an excuse to invade the country. Like I said before, nobody died and left America in charge of the world.</p>

<p>No doubts there, of course Saddam committed many crimes in the past.  But it was in the past.  Making him accountable for his acts was never the issue, it was going into Iraq under false pretenses.  We went in because of threats of weapons of mass destruction and involvement with 9/11, not because he was a bad person.  Why not get UN assistance to have his regime overthrown and let him be tried by the international court?  The UN only refused to invade because of insufficient evidence of WMD’s…so I don’t disagree that he should be hanged, just the way we went about doing it.[/quote]<br>
Exactly! BobDole, you’re very smart. And that comment isn’t given in terms of politics in ignoramus country.</p>

<p>Insufficient? Okay sure, their weapon’s inspectors getting forcibly removed from the country, yeah, there’s nothing going on there.[/quote]<br>
THERE WERE NO FUCKING WEAPONS! IT WAS A FACT!</p>
<p>The Bush administration, when questioned, said “Intelligence Failed” when they were asked “Why did we attack Iraq when there was no evidence of Weapons of Mass destruction”. Fuck you, intelligence didn’t fail. They lied. And Saddam shouldn’t be hung. The administration should be! AND ALSO! The whole war was illegal! Congress didn’t even give Bush the right to do it, and that retarded jack ass did it any way. That man should be impeached and imprisoned until he suffers the consequences of of ass fucking the USA.</p>

        <p>“So you think it’s ok to take someone away for any reason no matter what it is?”</p>
<p>Never did I hint at such a thing, stop putting words in my mouth.</p>
<p>“Turn off Fox News and wake up.”</p>
<p>I don’t watch Fox News, and shame on you for assuming so. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>“If you don’t believe in civil rights,”</p>
<p>Quite the master of at putting words into other’s mouths. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>“Saddam can do whatever he wants.”</p>
<p>Actually, he has to correspond with some set of U.N. guidelines. Mass killing of innocent people isn’t too favored in the global community. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>“It’s his country.”</p>
<p>No it wasn’t? He came to power due to a military coup that was supported by the U.S. So, essentially, it’s our country; had we not helped during this military coup, Saddam would be a sitting duck. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>“Who the fuck died and left America in charge?”</p>
<p>No one did, but when an establishment that is bent on peace actively fails at securing our nation’s interests, as well as the interests of our allies, then we have a right to take up arms and defend ourselves. Do you know why Germany, France &amp; Russia were opposed to the War in Iraq? Germany had oil ties with Iraq, which is a complete violation of U.N. imposed sanctions, France the same as Germany, and Russia was covertly selling MUNITIONS to Iraq. Yay for the opposition. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>“If someone came into my home, I would tell them to fuck off. If they still didn’t then I would have them killed.”</p>
<p>Refer back to your own civil rights mumbo-jumbo.</p>
<p>“I’m surprised he didn’t kill the UN inspectors”</p>
<p>Uh, because he had some form of intelligence? He would’ve been in such deep shit if he did that.</p>
<p>“Again, it was not our business.”</p>
<p>Okay, but it WAS the business of our allies. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>“He didn’t have nuclear weapons”</p>
<p>That was never the original debate in the first place, it was his capability of W.M.D.'s</p>
<p>And according to Wikipedia, a W.M.D. can be defined as the following:</p>
<p>“Terms used in a military context include atomic, biological, and chemical warfare (ABC warfare), nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) after the invention of the hydrogen bomb, and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN), recognizing the threat of non-explosive radiological weapons.”</p>
<p>We have found stockpiles of Chemical weapons &amp; agents. If you had read the article I had posted, your ignorance would have dwindled by just a bit. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkc164.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>“Him gassing the curds didn’t have anything to do with us.”</p>
<p>Refer back to your Civil Rights mumbo-jumbo. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>“We just pretended that we felt bad for them just to get an excuse to invade the country.”</p>
<p>And lose $400,000,000,000 in the mix. Oh yes, we’re quite the war-mongering country. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>“THERE WERE NO FUCKING WEAPONS! IT WAS A FACT!”</p>
<p>Refer to my article bub. You are quite wrong. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>“The U.N. is helping a ton on keeping the world together”</p>
<p>By raping innocent women &amp; children in poverty stricken areas? Oh, of course.</p>
<p>“Bush came and fucked it up”</p>
<p>How, exactly? By invading one country, the U.S. has seemed to disrupt all world politics? Please…</p>
<p>“Did you know, our foreign friends of the US has diminished to almost nothing?”</p>
<p>Like?</p>
<p>“Canada was pissed off because US withdrew a lot of there troops from Afghanistan and Canada was stuck there fighting the war,”</p>
<p>Haha, it doesn’t really matter if Canada was pissed, they’re still bound to NAFTA. So really, we haven’t lost a great friend.</p>

<p>Im going to have to disagree with you there ron. Even though i dont live in US i still know that saddam was a crazy and relentless torturer. He is not getting hanged because we invaded his country. He is getting hanged because he murdered 100s of people. They have found torture chambers with live cables hanging from the ceilings. Ready to shock the crap out of some civilian.</p>

<p>I must agree, but I’m also sure that Bush wouldn’t mind taking control of their oil iether, however it’s a country we are going to war with, not just Sadam!</p>

        <p>sometimes i truley think i live in the best country in the world <em>(New Zealand)</em> i mean we seem to keep out of all this crap by a mile. I think a person with half a brain would have thoguht saddam had WMDS. I mean hindsight sure is great isnt it. Way back when invasion started im sure you guys would have had your mouths securley zipped. But now that its gone and past. You can all say o yess i thought that all along. Its like when a sports team wins in a national league that you dont neccesarily support. Then your like o yes i suppoest them through and through.</p>

        <p>[quote=“bumblescum, post:33, topic:23325”]“Saddam can do whatever he wants.”</p>
<p>Actually, he has to correspond with some set of U.N. guidelines. Mass killing of innocent people isn’t too favored in the global community. :P[/quote]<br>
Actually it’s still his country. Why don’t you go to china and preach your little laws with the emperor. I’d like to see what you think of their opinion when your head is on a stick. China is part of the UN too, you know?</p>
<blockquote>"It's his country."
<p>No it wasn’t? He came to power due to a military coup that was supported by the U.S. So, essentially, it’s our country; had we not helped during this military coup, Saddam would be a sitting duck. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
</blockquote><br>
Um it doesn’t matter who put him in power, it doesn’t even matter that the US and Iraq were allies, what matters is who was controlling the country. He was a dictator, and that was his country. Just because someone put him in power does not mean they own that person and whatever territory he keeps.
<blockquote>"Who the fuck died and left America in charge?"
<p>No one did, but when an establishment that is bent on peace actively fails at securing our nation’s interests, as well as the interests of our allies, then we have a right to take up arms and defend ourselves. Do you know why Germany, France &amp; Russia were opposed to the War in Iraq? Germany had oil ties with Iraq, which is a complete violation of U.N. imposed sanctions, France the same as Germany, and Russia was covertly selling MUNITIONS to Iraq. Yay for the opposition. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
</blockquote><br>
Defend ourselves? Are you fucking kidding? No American died when he gassed the curds. He didn’t gas the Americans. So why are you saying we “have a right to take up arms and defend ourselves”. Do you know why people went into the election in such a anti-republican way? Because of the Iraq war. If you still favor the iraq war, then I consider that unethical cause that’s our people dying there for no reason. If you sign up for the war, which I bet you won’t, then you can say what you wish while a guy with an AK 47 is shooting at you and your own blood breaks your fall when your legs collapse.
<blockquote>"If someone came into my home, I would tell them to fuck off. If they still didn't then I would have them killed."
<p>Refer back to your own civil rights mumbo-jumbo.</p>
</blockquote><br>
You really are fascist aren’t you? Civil Rights mumbo jumbo. You really are demented. Do you like having rights? If you don’t, I suggest you go to N. Korea and have an orgy.
<blockquote>"I'm surprised he didn't kill the UN inspectors"
<p>Uh, because he had some form of intelligence? He would’ve been in such deep shit if he did that.</p>
</blockquote><br>
I was being radical to prove my point.
<blockquote>"Again, it was not our business."
<p>Okay, but it WAS the business of our allies. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
</blockquote><br>
You’re saying it was the business of Canada and Britain to go and fight them? That doesn’t even make sense. but at least you admitted that it wasn’t our business. Some progress there…
<blockquote>"He didn't have nuclear weapons"
<p>That was never the original debate in the first place, it was his capability of W.M.D.'s</p>
</blockquote><br>
No kidding.
<blockquote>And according to Wikipedia, a W.M.D. can be defined as the following:
<p>“Terms used in a military context include atomic, biological, and chemical warfare (ABC warfare), nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) after the invention of the hydrogen bomb, and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN), recognizing the threat of non-explosive radiological weapons.”</p>
</blockquote><br>
And according to reality, when Rumsfield was talking about WMD’s, he was talking about Nuclear Weapons. No one is going nitty gritty into the definitions.
<blockquote>We have found stockpiles of Chemical weapons &amp; agents. If you had read the article I had posted, your ignorance would have dwindled by just a bit. ;)</blockquote>
Your ignorance is exponential. Bush admitted that there were no WMDs (nuclear weapons in their definition) and said intelligence failed. 
<blockquote>"Him gassing the curds didn't have anything to do with us."
<p>Refer back to your Civil Rights mumbo-jumbo. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
</blockquote><br>
Again mumbo jumbo civil rights. Take your facist ass back to Nazi Germany man.
<blockquote>"We just pretended that we felt bad for them just to get an excuse to invade the country."
<p>And lose $400,000,000,000 in the mix. Oh yes, we’re quite the war-mongering country. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
</blockquote><br>
Do you think Bush even gave a shit what the cost was? He’s just thinking one day, oh hey, I’m going to spend 400 billion dollars on a war. No he wasn’t thinking that. He thought he could just jump in there, take saddam down, everyone would be happy, and then we could get out. Everyone though it would be a half year war until the shit hit the fan.
<blockquote>"THERE WERE NO FUCKING WEAPONS! IT WAS A FACT!"
<p>Refer to my article bub. You are quite wrong. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
</blockquote><br>
You are wrong. Look it up. Once again, Bush admitted it in public.
<blockquote>"The U.N. is helping a ton on keeping the world together"
<p>By raping innocent women &amp; children in poverty stricken areas? Oh, of course.</p>
</blockquote><br>
What the fuck? That doesn’t even make sense. Please prove your statements, don’t just rant about stuff you can’t back up.
<blockquote>"Bush came and fucked it up"
<p>How, exactly? By invading one country, the U.S. has seemed to disrupt all world politics? Please…</p>
</blockquote><br>
He doubled the deficit! We’re the biggest debtors in the entire world and you’re jerking off to this whole thing? He did fuck it up. Why do you think people call him the worst president in the world? Why do you think Hugo Chavez called him the Anti Christ? How senile are you?
<blockquote>"Did you know, our foreign friends of the US has diminished to almost nothing?"
<p>Like?</p>
</blockquote><br>
??? We had foreign friends such as Canada, Mexico, Germany, France, and many more. Ever since the Iraq war, a lot of people didn’t back up the US at first, so Bush openly called them names, etc. That pissed them off and Canada + Britain entered the war and Canada withdrew their soldiers. So far America has almost no foreign friends.
<blockquote>"Canada was pissed off because US withdrew a lot of there troops from Afghanistan and Canada was stuck there fighting the war,"
<p>Haha, it doesn’t really matter if Canada was pissed, they’re still bound to NAFTA. So really, we haven’t lost a great friend.</p>
</blockquote><br>
You would laugh about that? How would you like it if they brought back the draft, and you would get sent there fighting the war and you can laugh at someone cutting off your balls.
<p>~Ron</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot to mention. Democrats one majority in Congress too. Yay!</p>
