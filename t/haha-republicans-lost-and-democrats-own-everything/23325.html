<p>Yes. Democrats have a majority in the House and it‚Äôs VERY close majority in the Senate. In the Senate, Democrats have 50% and Republicans have 49%, everybody is waiting on that last percent.</p>
<p>Finally the Military Commissions Act, can be rejected hopefully. The Patriot act can go fuck itself and Bush won‚Äôt be able to take away any more of our rights (hopefully). Just two more years‚Ä¶ just two more years. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyc164.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>If anyone wants to read about the Bush Human Torture act I was talking about. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/opinion/28thu1.html?ei=5088&amp;en=3eb3b23c27944ff9&amp;ex=1317096000&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1163030486" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Refer to this article.</a></p>
<p>If anyone wants to argue what the <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/hr3162.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">patriot act</a> <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> does, read the act and see what it does first. Oh by the way, it‚Äôs called the patriot act, so that if any one is against it, then they are supposedly unpatriotic. Fuck them if you think so. Anyone not against this law is unpatriotic and a terrorist (someone causing terror. You don‚Äôt have to be blowing up bombs to cause terror).</p>
<p>~Ron</p>
<p>PS: I‚Äôm so fucking happy.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyc164.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Edit: Democrats one majority in congress too! WOO HOO! Now they got the job, hopefully they can do it right. War is not over yet. Oh and I found the name of the act that let bush torture whoever he wanted on any premises. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúMilitary Commissions Act‚Äù.</p>

        <p>Do not get me wrong, I do not support the Republicans, however at this point Republican rule will be the best, as we need to finish the war in Iraq, also the election of Democrats will cause higher taxes. I would not consider iether of the government systems good at this point (the Democrats are still better than Republicans).<br>
P.S.<br>
Don‚Äôt get too sure, we‚Äôll only find out the true results of the VA vote tomorow (probably Democrats will win, but still; oh, and Steel is winning in Marryland :mad:)</p>

</aside>
<p>cruel, state why you think it doesn‚Äôt cause terror. Because it does. That‚Äôs why there was a lot of commotion when it was created. If you actually read the article, which I know you haven‚Äôt, then make a statement and back it up. Without any proof, everything you say is like pissing in the wind.</p>
<blockquote>Just an inconvenience. I support profiling people... and in times of war, there is no time for people whining about violations of their rights. Although, it should be nearing it's death... losing it's usefulness.</blockquote>
So if the Bush administration some how thought you were involved with terrorism or just didn't like you, and they took away your rights, and no one ever heard from you again (This is in the Military Commisions Act), you wouldn't care? You would just say, "Well since we're in war, I would rather die for my country then have a choice whether I live or die. " That's completely retarded.
<blockquote>And I'm all for pulling troops out and bombing people to hell... but people would be whining even more about innocent people dying... so how does that help your cause? Bush has been fighting all wrong. He's a pussy and cares too much about public opinion... he should have fought the war more aggressively.</blockquote>
He should have fought the right country. Again, Iraqis were not involved in 9/11. He has twisted your naive ignorant little brains into thinking there is a cause in this shit of a war. But there isn't. 
<blockquote>We've wasted too much time... we should stop caring about other countrys and allow genocides. When we go into foreign countries, people whine either way... so just let them die.</blockquote>
Yes. Yes just let them die, so they can live. That might sound corny, but it's true. Just leave them alone. They aren't Americans. Why are we there? Why are we trying to shove our values down other peoples' throats when they clearly don't want them and couldn't give a rat's ass about them.
<p>Right now, the Iraqis would rather die than be under Fascist American rule. We created this chaos and we were supposedly trying to help. So now Iraq hates us and we create new terrorists every day. We kill 1 Iraqi and that person‚Äôs family is not going to be justifying his death because he got in the way. That family is going to get out weapons and fire at the soldiers. Wasn‚Äôt the ‚ÄúWar on Terror‚Äù supposed to decrease the amount of terrorists? Boy, didn‚Äôt you support the wrong war.</p>

<p>"Obviously, no massive stockpiles of chemical weapons.</p>
<p>Regardless of what individuals think about Bush, what he said about Iraq and how he justified the war, in the end it was not for him to pass judgement. Judgement began with the terms of the ceasefire of 1991, laid out in their entirety in UN Resolution 687.</p>
<p>And, according to the UN weapons inspection reports as well as new findings made since, Hussein‚Äôs Iraq thoroughly violated both the spirit and letter of the ceasefire terms. Under standard international law, any one instance of doing so gives any signatory nation ‚Äúcasus belli‚Äù, or ‚Äúcause for war‚Äù.</p>
<p>UNR 687 specifically made the nations which comprised the 1991 Coalition signatories to the ceasefire. This included the United States.</p>
<p>Hans Blix, in his final report to the United Nations, stated that the following had been discovered, all in violation of the ceasefire:</p>

<li>
<p>An ongoing program for the tailored production of assassination bioweapons. Half a dozen Iraqis had been used as test subjects by the time of the invasion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>650+ pounds of biological growth material, initially declared in 1991 by Iraq, never recovered. Iraqi declarations of 2003 omitted this and tried to hide the fact by renumbering the pages of the original declaration. The material, Blix said, was capable of producing 5000+ liters of anthrax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6,500 chemical munitions containing, collectively, 1,000 tons of chemical agents, never recovered. Again, the Hussein regime falsified paperwork in an effort to hide the existence of these weapons, but the plot was uncovered by UN inspection teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ongoing production of intermediate-range ballistic missiles capable of striking Israel, to include the use of manufacturing equipment previously declared destroyed by the Hussein regime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parts, plans, and materials for the production of nuclear weaponry, to include a working bomb design and 100 tons of yellowcake uranium. Some of this uranium had already been partially enriched and was discovered at Iraq‚Äôs former nuclear weapons research facility. According to a recent New York Times article, pre-1991 Iraq was within a year of bomb production. According to the weapons inspectors, Iraq was waiting for sanctions to be lifted before reconstituting its nuclear and other WMD programs. It is safe to say that had sanctions been lifted by 2001, Iraq would very likely have detonated a test bomb by now.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these items represent what Hans Blix called ‚Äúmaterial breaches‚Äù of the ceasefire. They do not include Iraq‚Äôs refusal to abide by more than a dozen non-WMD-related ceasefire terms, including the repatriation to Kuwait of kidnapped citizens and known prisoners of war. Out of over twenty terms which Hussein‚Äôs regime agreed to in 1991, only two were ever met.</p>
<p>UNR 1441 sought to put an end to Iraq‚Äôs refusal to abide by these terms, setting a deadline for 100% compliance.</p>
<p>After the deadline passed, according to 1441, Iraq would receive NO FURTHER CHANCES FOR COMPLIANCE. This meant that no further diplomatic solutions could be offered once past the deadline ‚Äî none could be formulated that did not amount to giving Iraq yet another chance for compliance.</p>
<p>The deadline came and passed with Iraq still not in compliance‚Ä¶whereupon France immediately threatened to veto any military action against the Hussein regime. The UN had painted itself into a corner. Whenever the Security Council next met to discuss Iraq, France would invoke its veto of military action, 1441 would block any further diplomatic solution, and the UN would be completely unable to enforce 687 in any way. Hussein would get off essentially scot-free.</p>
<p>However, the meeting never took place and France never got the chance to exercise its veto. Instead, the United States and Britain invoked their rights as UN-appointed signatories to the ceasefire and declared they would see to its enforcement. This is the same legal basis as was used to create the ‚ÄúNo Fly Zones‚Äù and justify Clinton‚Äôs 1998 ‚ÄúOperation Desert Fox‚Äù.</p>
<p>Regardless of anyone‚Äôs personal opinion of Bush, good or bad, the facts are stark and clear: Hussein had twelve years to comply with the ceasefire it agreed to, refused to do so, and was given an ultimatum for compliance by the UN which he likewise refused.</p>
<p>There is likewise no question that Hussein‚Äôs regime did not account for, and in fact tried to hide the existence of, weapons of mass destruction. The fact that these weapons have not yet been found does not negate the fact that they did indeed exist, and that Hussein‚Äôs refusal to turn them over was a cause for war. Even if they did not exist at all, Hussein‚Äôs violations of the remaining ceasefire terms provide more than sufficient cause.</p>
<p>Hence, there is no question that the war was justified as an act of international law enforcement, and would have to have been conducted regardless of what Bush actually had to say about it."</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy are we trying to shove our values down other peoples‚Äô throats when they clearly don‚Äôt want them and couldn‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass about them.‚Äù</p>
<p>Are you suggesting a despotism is better than democracy? Are you suggesting Saddam killing hundreds of thousands of Kurdish people, better than an active, stable democracy? With minimal  corruption?</p>
<p>‚ÄúRight now, the Iraqis would rather die than be under Fascist American rule.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ah, yes, that‚Äôs why they turned up to vote for their legislative branch of government, and their president/prime minister. The U.S. controls nothing in Iraq, with the exception of the troops there.</p>

Do not get me wrong, I do not support the Republicans, however at this point Republican rule will be the best, as we need to finish the war in Iraq, also the election of Democrats will cause higher taxes. I would not consider iether of the government systems good at this point (the Democrats are still better than Republicans).<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>So you agree with the Military Commissions Act? That‚Äôs the torture act created by the Republicans. I bet you would turn the other cheek if they thought you were involved in anything. You can be one of those ‚Äòdissappearing people‚Äô we heard about</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt want your opinion on everything, I want it on the main issues. Comment on what I said above, and not just parts of it. Take everything into consideration.</p>
<p>Finish the war in Iraq? Last I heard, we won the war in Iraq and yet our people the brave soldiers who went to fight this shit war are dying right and left. Should I be happy that it‚Äôs cleaning out the gene pool or should I be angry that my fellow American is dying for no reason.</p>
<p>~Ron[/quote]</p>
<p>No, I do not support their torture, however from their point of view it is nessesary (bastards), I do agree that there are many other methods of maintaining power rather than this. Please note that this is a decision made by Bush, and in case you didn‚Äôt notice the senate isn‚Äôt only republicans and I‚Äôm positive that some republicans voted against. As for the war- launching nuces will kill many civilians and devistate the country even more, also the over use of nuces might cause the whole planet to die, there for, they are only to be used in desparate situations.   No, our fellow citizens shouldn‚Äôt be out there, but do we have a choice? Bush is still at power, and we‚Äôll just have to deal with it for the next 2 years :mad:</p>
<p>P.S.<br>
How you like the Bush State of Union speach (the link is posted in my last post)? For once he speaks the truth</p>
