<p>^ why so serious?[/quote]<br>
i used to hate you, but i gotta say, your by far the best mod on these forums.<br>
on topic: go into client.java and search</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void Deleteobjects() {</code></pre>
<p>youll see like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> 	       deletethatobject(3509, 9497);
 	       deletethatobject(2898, 3428);
 	       deletethatobject(2956, 3212);</code></pre>
<p>etc, go on silab client <a href="http://client.silabsoft.org" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> and right click the object, get the coords and add them where those 2, four digit numbers are, compile, and voila.</p>
