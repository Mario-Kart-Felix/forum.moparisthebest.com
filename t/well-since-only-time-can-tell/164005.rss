    <description>I know they&#39;re a lot of these kind of topics today, but tell me your thoughts whether Jagex will stay with the current system, or go back to the orginal one.


As with the SS riot back in January, I believe they will switch it, mostly because of the uproar in game, and on the forums{topic in rants section with nearing 20k+ posts} but not totally undo it, they probably will bring back pking imo.</description>

<p>Even one of the staff members said that they knew it would be a bumpy ride to remove features such as PKing, but after that they’ll be able to focus on updating the game rather than its security. I have a feeling something BIG (much bigger than summoning) will be coming next year.[/quote]</p>
<p>Jsgex is definately planning something big. They have to make up for all the crappy updates they made to stop some people from making money off the game besdes them.</p>

Why don’t they make it so money can’t be brought into the wild?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>They already did, but according to them that wont stop the traders and I see how. Not only are they trying to stop RWT, but also ways of “unfairly” trading stuff over to a lower level account of yours. I both agree and disagree with their methods. First of all, I think that giving YOUR items to YOUR own account is 120% fair. Why? Because you already spent the hard work and time getting the money, or skill, to get the achieved item. Of course, that still is an unfair advantage since you’re making a lower level character with much more expensive and better equipment.[/quote]<br>

<p>That was the most shitfaced post I have ever read.  I’ll debunk it just like Loose Change.</p>
<p>They’re not undoing the updates, but they will make changes to keep people happy.  THAT’S WHAT THEY SAID.</p>
<p>No, they aren’t going to sell gold themselves.  It has nothing to do with real world economics.</p>
<p>The GE isn’t for foreign people.  You think they can read and understand the entirely English/German interface but can’t type ‘Buying shit’?  Common sense, retard.</p>
<p>They won’t delete inactive accounts, because there is no point whatsoever.  And an ex-member can only use number of bank slots a free player can, so shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>And yes, they would care, because unhappy customers = no customers.  Is that such a difficult concept to understand?  Retard?</p>

Heres what jagex needs to do:<br>
Make dummy websites, that claim to sell a mil for $2.<br>
People will fall for it, every IP and name will be monitored.<br>
If the last ip on the account matches the IP of the buyer, they ban the account on suspisions.<br>
People will figure out that they are rigging sites, and will be afraid to buy gp<br>

<p>Its basically the perfect crime; If you want to call it that…<br>
They “Sell” the gold,<br>
They “Try” to “Stop” the gold.</p>
