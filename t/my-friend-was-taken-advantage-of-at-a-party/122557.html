<p>My m8 fucked a guy at a party the other day while she was drunk, now she is worried she may be pregnant  and she has to go to a clinic.[/i]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Oh great, I hear many stories like this every day. I simply reply with:</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><br>
Dave says:<br>
How fucking stupid of her.</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
And then I get a reply of:</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i"><br>
Blonde says:<br>
What? It wasn’t her fault; she was taken advantage of by this older guy. I feel so sorry for her.<br>
</span>[b]<br>
How is it not her fault? Even when I am completely pissed out of my head, throwing up and all I want to do is fuck – I still would use a condom. So how can she be so drunk that she can’t simply say “no” or “ok but only if we use a condom”.</p>
<pre><code>This leads me to believe that girls like the girl at the party are just trying to make an excuse for what they did because they are too embarrassed to admit they wanted to have sex. Sure there are many girls who have been actually taken advantage of, but only to the extent that it is actually classed as rape. I am not at all condoning the guys actions; what the guy did was wrong, but there is no way truth in saying that what the girl did was right.

So in conclusion, don’t be stupid at a party. No matter how drunk you are. Alcohol cannot be blamed for saying yes to what you would usually say no to.

I believe that when a person is under the influence of alcohol, we can see who the person really is, without all the inhibitions created by our society. So if the person agreed to having sex, that’s what she really wanted at the moment. When the person is sober the morning after (aka under the influence of inhibitions by our society), she knows who she really is. In this case, according to our society, a slut.</p>
<p>If a person is an asshole while drunk, don’t blame the alcohol, blame the person, because that’s what he/she really is.</p>

        <p>Haha o just had a close incident about this. My chick mate was drunk as a skunk. And this guy was hitting on her all night. She kept saying no but he was real friendly. I kept a close eye on her as i didnt know the guy. IN the end she ended up so drunk she couldnt stand and fell into his arms etc. He enjoyed it and fondeled her hair etc. Just as i was about to leave a impression of my dr martin boots in his face. I had to help mate who was puking. When i got back he was real close to her. I just walked up and picked her up off ground and carried her away. Although he did try and say she was fine i just walked off. BY the time i got back without her he had gone but if i ever see him again.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: Dont hit on drunk chicks when they are saying no to you, especially ones that look remotely punk, as they probably have big as mates with a nice pair of dr martin boots on ( i.e me) just waiting to curb stomp your head in.</p>

<p>That’s bullshit, sure alcohol loosens inhibitions, but it dosen’t force you to do anything you don’t want to do.</p>
<p>In court, if someone beats the shit out of someone while drunk, it’s still assault… so if someone fucks someone while drunk and dosen’t like it in the morning, tough shit imo.</p>
