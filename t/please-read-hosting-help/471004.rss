    <description>I got my hands on Project Annihilation package. I ran it with eclipse, all the blah blah. And I got it working.

Well, I got multiple computers at my home which I want to use while working with this project. I was wondering how can I host this server for home use only if possible, or host it period if it comes to that. I want to be able to login to the server and see my other character, all from two computers at my house. 

I tried to follow the hosting guides I see posted. But with this pja, I cannot figure how to take a no-ip and put it with eclipse, server, or even put to the client. The whole ctr+f - find &quot;server&quot; &quot;ip&quot; or anything like that, does not work because I cannot find the file which has that. 

Also, I have these files on a lab-top, which is wireless connect to a router. The second computer is also wireless connect. I got a main computer which is direct connected to router, which is my work computer, so I don&#39;t use it for any projects.



[b]So.. back to topic. I need help figuring out how to take the server + client and host it for home use between two computers basically.

              <p>On the second computer. I downloaded the 459 client which is what works with the server. I edit the ip section and change it to my no-ip. I’m still not getting connection.</p>
<p>I did the uturrent, made my port forward. And of course, IP got the no-ip up. What I’m I missing?</p>
<p>Also… the way I run the server, I use eclipse. I don’t know if that the issue?? Or I’m just missing something…</p>

              <p>Make sure you’ve port-forwarded the hosting computer. Don’t give the hosting computer’s IP out to anyone. Keep it to yourself. You’ll probably also need to use uTorrent to make sure the port is open.</p>
<p>Now in order for your client to connect, you’ll need to edit the proper method in the client.java of your Client. If you were able to connect to it before, just search up “127.0.0.1”. Replace that with your no-ip.</p>
