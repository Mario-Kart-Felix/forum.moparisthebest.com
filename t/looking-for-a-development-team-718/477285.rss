    <title>Looking for a Development Team - 718</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-development-team-718/477285</link>
    <description>Well let me start off saying, that I don&#39;t have the best experience. All that I&#39;ve learned was from meddling around on my 667, and 718 servers. I know the basics, and I admit that, but that&#39;s never enough. I&#39;m more of a hands on person, I like to learn things as I go. If you&#39;d like to join me please list your experience below. The source is going to be Ben&#39;s Project, and in the future hopefully be hosted. Thanks for reading :)</description>

              <p>As same as you guys, I don’t have all the best knowledge in developing servers…but I do have decent Java Skills, such as I took a class last year for Computer Programming and learned alot, such as Arrays, Integers, Strings, if statements, cases, and many more…all I gotta do is learn how to apply that to the runescape private server in which I need to code! Which is basicly just knowing where everything is and how it all works, like I need a branch of what all the little parts connect to in order for the server to start.</p>
<p>If you’d like to talk, here’s my Skype: michael_the_shorty<br>
If you do not use skype, then just reply here I guess. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I am intrested in coding 718 as well as 317. Like you I don’t have too much knowledge at the moment. However I know and understand basic java stuff. I am also handling minecraft server at the moment so I might be able to host that as well (at least in the beginning).</p>
