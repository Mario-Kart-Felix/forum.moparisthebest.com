    <description>Well, i cant runmy server because the black box that is supposed to open when u click runserver dosnt stay open.. it just shuts, and i have tried everythingon the forums nothing seems to work, maybe i tried somthing and did it wrong? i just want som1 to help please. and i used and auto clicker to click the box, and i figured out that it said inside somthing like, &#39;java&#39; was not recognized as an internal or external command&#39; and.. at first my compiler wouldnt work, so sombody told me to edit my enviorment labels and i realized that the 2 enviorment labels werent there, so i added them with the right values and everything.. thought that was the problem by a chance, then i went to run my server and it emediatly closed theblack box, saying &#39;java&#39; was not found as an internal or external command.. and i have tried many things, as i said b4. but maybe i didnt do somthing right?</description>
