    <description>Ok, i recently opened purelife in beta and have been making huge changes to the server, i already have a client that i let people download and use till i figure out more about clients for some reason i have clientsyndrome and cannot work with clients well. What i really need is a client manager for this project!

requirements:
Skype/tv
NEED TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE WEBCLIENT!!!!!!!

What will you get in return? You will be a staff member of the server and when a donations option is promoted we can discuss your cut in cash.

Message me on here ! or post here. 

sincerely,

<p>Also, you are not allowed to offer anything in return. Especially when discussing the “cut” of the cash you get from donations. Donations should be used only to help pay for the VPS/Domain name/other things necessary to run the server; not as a form of payment.</p>
