    <title>C# Client-Server Framework</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/c-client-server-framework/540617</link>
    <description>[b]Intro:[/b]
I built a client-server framework in c#
It&#39;s basically everything you need to make an application/game/... in a client-server environment.
It&#39;s my first actual finished project I made after &quot;mastering&quot; c# so feedback is definitely appreciated.

[b]Information:[/b]
I&#39;m using serialization for communication between the client and server.
A base class is used, which should be inherited by all the data-transfer classes (the objects that get serialized and send over the network)
for security purposes. We don&#39;t want people to &quot;cheat&quot;.
When they are not valid they will be rejected and the connection will be closed.

The server is a simple command prompt that uses input commands to perform actions on the server.
Obviously since this being a framework we only need a few base commands which are:

[ul][li]launch (launching the server)[/li]
[li]shutdown (closes down the server)[/li][/ul]



[b]Here&#39;s a look to the command prompt of the server:[/b]

There&#39;s also a basic authentication system build in since basically every server-network application needs/will use it.
Response codes are in it as well.

[b]When the server is offline when trying to connect to it:[/b]

[b]When the server goes down while we&#39;re connected.[/b]

[b]Simple account detail checks.[/b]

If the account doesn&#39;t exist it will be created automatically.
The authentication/account management is very very basic,
it&#39;s a piece of cake to change it to your likings.
Same counts for the authentication form, and the game form where you are redirected to after logging in is just and empty form.


[b]Process:[/b]
SERVER
 - Wait for connection requests
 - Accept the client
 - Create new connection object with the client assigned
 - Let the connection listen for incoming data

CLIENT
 - Try to connect to the server
 - Create new connection object with the client assigned
 - Send an authentication request
 - Receive a response code
 - Listen for incoming data


[b]Github:[/b] https://github.com/randqm/Csharp_client-server_framework


If you would like to have the whole solution I can make a download for it.
It&#39;s built with visual studio 2012 so be aware of possible problems when using another version.</description>

I think he’s one of those that think enums are nothing but ‘bloat’, promote bad programming practice, and the lack of object orientation with them… that would be my guess. That seems like the common protest of enums.</p>

              <p>With serialization the danger is that you’ll easily start losing track of total overhead of a single object. Something that seems small could turn it to be huge once serialized.<br>
It generally is better to write data through a BinaryWriter, and just write away the member fields manually. It’s more work but generally more efficient and controllable. If you’re making games, this is what you want to do, either with a simple library or something you make yourself.</p>

<p> AtomicInt_: t4: depends on what kind of serialization<br>
 if AtomicInt_'s talking about java’s serialization, I agree with t4<br>
 if you are talking about json or xml or something, not bad<br>
 oh, that’s true<br>
 json and other text formats are fine<br>
 the only acceptible binary format is big endian integral</p>

<p>That said, most of t4’s reasons there are wrong (esp serialization impl one, even if it does change you should be fine as long as you use the proper methods and aren’t trying to manually decode the format)</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">Intro:</span><br>
I built a client-server framework in c#<br>
It’s basically everything you need to make an application/game/… in a client-server environment.<br>
It’s my first actual finished project I made after “mastering” c# so feedback is definitely appreciated.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Information:</span><br>
I’m using serialization for communication between the client and server.<br>
A base class is used, which should be inherited by all the data-transfer classes (the objects that get serialized and send over the network)<br>
for security purposes. We don’t want people to “cheat”.<br>
When they are not valid they will be rejected and the connection will be closed.</p>
<p>The server is a simple command prompt that uses input commands to perform actions on the server.<br>
Obviously since this being a framework we only need a few base commands which are:</p>
<p>[ul][li]launch (launching the server)[/li]<br>
[li]shutdown (closes down the server)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Here’s a look to the command prompt of the server:</span><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/EW7v2Yj.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>There’s also a basic authentication system build in since basically every server-network application needs/will use it.<br>
Response codes are in it as well.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">When the server is offline when trying to connect to it:</span><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/EAeDyZs.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">When the server goes down while we’re connected.</span><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/YDrR8NP.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Simple account detail checks.</span><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/UiCMF71.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/VosL4RL.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>If the account doesn’t exist it will be created automatically.<br>
The authentication/account management is very very basic,<br>
it’s a piece of cake to change it to your likings.<br>
Same counts for the authentication form, and the game form where you are redirected to after logging in is just and empty form.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Process:</span><br>
SERVER</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait for connection requests</li>
<li>Accept the client</li>
<li>Create new connection object with the client assigned</li>
<li>Let the connection listen for incoming data</li>
</ul>
<p>CLIENT</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to connect to the server</li>
<li>Create new connection object with the client assigned</li>
<li>Send an authentication request</li>
<li>Receive a response code</li>
<li>Listen for incoming data</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Github:</span> <a href="https://github.com/randqm/Csharp_client-server_framework" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/randqm/Csharp_client-server_framework</a></p>
<p>If you would like to have the whole solution I can make a download for it.<br>
It’s built with visual studio 2012 so be aware of possible problems when using another version.</p>
