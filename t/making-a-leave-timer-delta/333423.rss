    <title>Making a leave timer [delta]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-leave-timer-delta/333423</link>
    <description>Hi, How would i make a timer so that if a player dies a person cannot leave the area for 3 minutes?

I have looked on Google, MoparScape, R~S and R~L but have had no sucess, Help would be much appreciated..

I have managed to come up with this;

I declared this;
[code]public long leaveTimer = 0;[/code]

Then to my leave area object i added this;
[code]	case 2609:
	if (System.currentTimeMillis() - leaveTimer &gt;= 180000) //180000 = 180 seconds = 3 minutes
		sM(&quot;You have a penalty and cannot leave&quot;);
	{
		else
	}
		leaveTimer = System.currentTimeMillis();
			toX = 3222;
			toY = 3222;
		sM(&quot;You leave the bounty Hunter Crater&quot;);
	break;[/code]

Thankyou

Thats all ive got so far, but i don&#39;t know how to make it so when i kill someone who is not my target i get the penalty and cannot leave.</description>
