    <description>Recently i&#39;ve hade a problem with my computer, so i rebuilt it.

I have:
windows xp

i have been tryign to write stuff to cd&#39;s although they either say they are write protected or only allow me to write one set of data and then say its read only or access is denied.

i got roxio (cd-dvd writing wizard) under options it says the Read me is unchecked (check box) (means its not on) although its still writing read me discs.

I tried windows writing wizard and that has the same problem.

any programs that allwo you to write without read me, any drivers, any information would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in Advance,
RSC
