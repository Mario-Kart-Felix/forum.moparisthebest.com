    <title>We&#39;re Hiring iOS Developers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/were-hiring-ios-developers/546868</link>
    <description>Hey,

Im looking for experienced iOS developers in the UK who would be willing to relocate to yorkshire (its lovely here), It&#39;s a fantastic iOS developer position, working closely with other developers and designers to drive forward the exciting projects that we are engaged with on behalf of our clients.

We have some really big clients and work on some great apps, currently a 10 man team looking to expand.

If you are not a iOS developer but know someone who is if they are successfully recruited and within the job for 3 months you will get a £100 cash referral fee.  :)

You can inbox me for more information,</description>

In my trials, the window builders for Swing have been completely worthless for most practical application, it is easier to just design the JFrame via code, which can get quite troublesome. JavaFX is (from what I’ve heard) an improvement on swing, and has proven to be, although it also has it’s issues, as anything does. Yes, I was referring to visual studio, as that’s all I have experience with, and that has proven to be easier, in my trials of course. Writing applications such as games or GUI’s with lots of functions such as a calculator, has proven to be extremely frustrating.</p>

i’m too old for this shit! I remember when these lads only worried about making ruler_ cry. Now they are all grown up making job offers and leaving the house<br>

Haha, don’t say that - I’m only a few years behind you. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>And just to be clear, I don’t think this website should become a defacto job board. I was just noting with interest that it was a first. And that makes sense, as a lot of the guys who were around 16 or 17 back in 2006 will be starting to move deeper into their careers, and maybe they will recall peers here that they feel are suitable for offerings where they work.<br>
I’m interviewing for a senior .NET software developer position on Wednesday myself, and that marks a reasonable career progression for me. Despite only having the Java guru award, it’s actually the Microsoft technology stack that I work with professionally. Ironic considering I always made fun of a guy I went to highschool with because of his preference for C#.[/quote]Glad you made the right choice. Once you go C# you never go back.</p>

<p>Haha, don’t say that - I’m only a few years behind you. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>And just to be clear, I don’t think this website should become a defacto job board. I was just noting with interest that it was a first. And that makes sense, as a lot of the guys who were around 16 or 17 back in 2006 will be starting to move deeper into their careers, and maybe they will recall peers here that they feel are suitable for offerings where they work.<br>
I’m interviewing for a senior .NET software developer position on Wednesday myself, and that marks a reasonable career progression for me. Despite only having the Java guru award, it’s actually the Microsoft technology stack that I work with professionally. Ironic considering I always made fun of a guy I went to highschool with because of his preference for C#.</p>

<p>If I was into programming it could be beneficial for myself and I am sure it could be beneficial for somebody out there as well. When you work in a group of other programmers your style is able to be reviewed and if improvements are offered it can even help you.</p>

Eh, I’ll have to agree with you on this. I am unable to work on any freelancing websites currently as I am just several months shy of being the legal age required. Maybe we could have some sort of middle-man system for people who can’t legally agree to a contract, where a “trusted member” would verify both ends of deals are being completed and no scamming has been attempted, maybe.</p>

<p>True. <span class="mention">@OP</span>: Since you’re asking on here you’re probably better off looking for freelance developers who you can pay per-job, and take all the profit from the apps you make.</p>
