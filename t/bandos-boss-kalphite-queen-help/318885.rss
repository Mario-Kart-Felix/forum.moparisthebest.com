    <title>Bandos Boss &amp; Kalphite Queen Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bandos-boss-kalphite-queen-help/318885</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having problems with my Kalphite Queen &amp; General Graardor (Bandos Boss).
My KQ doesn&#39;t hit high enough, &amp; Graardor wont hit anything at all. But he does attack.
If anyone could give me a code to fix these problems &amp; tell me where to put it that would be great.
And also if someone could give me a code to spawn the 2nd form of the KQ after the 1st form is dead I would like that too.</description>

<p>To raise it’s defense you have to go into where it handles player vs npc combat and change it’s defense.</p>

              <p>umm in order spawn the 2nd kq form try looking at zooscape v1, it does the secound form better nicely. Um also you can look up the monsters in ur files area and look for that true false crap, then look where it says “hit=0” or sumthing like that and change it to whatever. There should also be one for how often they hit that max</p>
