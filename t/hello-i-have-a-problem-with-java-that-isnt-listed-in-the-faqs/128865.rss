    <title>Hello, i have a problem with java that isn&#39;t listed in the FAQ&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hello-i-have-a-problem-with-java-that-isnt-listed-in-the-faqs/128865</link>
    <description>I try to load up one of the servers in a browser and a white screen shows up with a java box on the upper left hand corner. Then it looks like it is about to load and then the java box disappears and a red &quot;x&quot; in a box appears were it was. I need a little bit of help concerning this and how to fix it. Thank you.</description>
