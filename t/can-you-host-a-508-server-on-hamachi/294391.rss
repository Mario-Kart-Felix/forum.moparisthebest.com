    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-you-host-a-508-server-on-hamachi/294391</link>
    <description>Ok, I was wondering can you host a server on Hamachi?  Like my friend tried to use a 508 HD client. (Which works with me) It wont connect for him.  If you can send me a tutorial on how to make a 508 server, post it here.  PLEASE!!!!  I need the help.</description>
