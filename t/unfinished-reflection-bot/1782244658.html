<p>i love how you seem to love open source, though open source more often than not involves licensing and giving credit where it is due, it appears that you have no problem with theft of intellectual property. your apparent hypocrisy and stupidity is unrivaled</p>

        <p>Yakman, while I respect you as a developer and a poster - it’s your “open source is the solution to all problems” attitude that introduces many problems to the FOSS world, in my opinion, not least by making everyone think that we are all stark raving mad communist uber-hippies who are all fighting to steal their personal freedoms one badly written C++ application at a time.</p>
<p>Because you use this development model, every single developer in the world should be forced to use it to, by you rereleasing their product under a different license illegally (that is essentially what “leaking” is, no?) This is freedom?</p>
<p>I use FOSS. I use a <em>lot</em> of FOSS, from my operating system to my window manager to 90% of my applications. Do I completely denounce commercial software? No. I use commercial software, shit, I have written closed-source commercial software.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, open source is not about changing the world. It is not about forcing anyone to do anything they don’t want to do. It is about having the source code to your applications available to change how you wish, enabling personal customisation and the easy collaboration of developers. That is <em>it</em>. It’s a <em>development model</em>, not a poor way for the laymen to learn about Communism. (That said, it has nothing to do with Communism anyway, the metaphor is very very loose).</p>
<p>Right this is absurdly ranty, so, summary time: Leaking shit is wrong, whether you hide behind the “i believe in open source!” banner or not.</p>

        <p>yes, I’m sorry, i admit i did wrong,<br>
i didn’t realise my posts sounded like they were trying to force my believes onto other people, i guess i just liked to moan loudly.</p>
<p>in my defence though, i have nothing against credit where credit is due, its just a few lines in the readme file saying who helped you.<br>
also, in my previous post, i was talking about <span class="bbcode-i">using</span> leaked code, not really doing the leaking myself</p>

        <p><a class="mention" href="../../u/mopman-2.html">@Mopman</a>: Well put. I loved the last line <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It’s interesting that the people that have pushed me to <span class="bbcode-b">open</span> my source and accused me of <span class="bbcode-i">information whoring</span> are the ones that would benefit most from my acquiescing. I think the case can be made that the ones that scream the loudest for opening someone else’s source, are likely the ones that would gain the most. Tell me, what does the developer that actually wrote the code really gain? Fame? Respect? Nothing. How absolutely typical… While it’s nice to have your ego stroked, it sure as hell doesn’t pay the bills and put food on the table[sup]1[/sup]. While some code is written for the pure love of the craft, let’s be real, much code is written to line the pockets so you can code another day.</p>
<p>I’ve had many conversations with other individuals that know just about everything about the rs client. (Most are simply not active here… wonder why…). Every one of them has been told, in one way or another, that they should <span class="bbcode-b">open</span> their source for the good of the community. Bull. If wL had released his real server and his completely renamed client, it would have been far more information than the community needed. It was completely his prerogative to decide not to give his code to the community at large.</p>
<p>I believe there are times and places for open source and closed source. Like Mopman eloquently put,</p>
<p>[quote=“Mopman, post:23, topic:178224”]…<br>
At the end of the day, open source is not about changing the world. It is not about forcing anyone to do anything they don’t want to do. It is about having the source code to your applications available to change how you wish, enabling personal customisation and the easy collaboration of developers. That is <em>it</em>.<br>
…[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree that if you plan on giving something away for free, you sure as hell should provide the code so that others can learn from it. Licensing under that model, is more, I think, to protect the code from being abused and also to allow the original writer to get his/her/their ego(s) stroked every so often.</p>
<p>If my system was one that was going to go out to the public freely, I wouldn’t have a problem gpl’ing it. That’s just it, I have no intentions to do so. Most of my code is completely closed source. Most of the information behind it is also. Some may call it <span class="bbcode-b">knowledge whoring</span>[sup]2[/sup] but I disagree. If someone came to a knowledge of something on their own, why should the be disparaged just because they don’t feel like spoon feeding anyone that comes after them? Sounds like something kids do when something ‘gets too hard’ and they want someone to give them the answer; whining.</p>
<p>[sup]1[/sup]: Yes, I know first hand that having a good coding reputation can land you all kinds of fantastic consulting jobs it is more an exception than the rule.<br>
[sup]2[/sup]: A malapropism if you ask me as it has nothing to do with prostituting knowledge. Perhaps <span class="bbcode-b">knowledge hording</span> would have been more appropriate</p>

I found myself with long run-on sentences that really took away from what I was trying to say when I had inlined my ‘footnotes’. The only solutions I could think of were superscripts.</p>
<p>As far as the elitist attitude goes I agree with you. It sucks. But that is precisely why I did the research I did. I wanted to know what the supposed elitists knew. And now, I do.</p>
<p>Another interesting pattern I’ve seen is that the term <span class="bbcode-i">elitism</span> is used along with <span class="bbcode-i">knowledge whoring</span>. Elitism seems to be just a term used on someone that may take a jab at someone else making a stupid/ignorant/wrong statement. Further, the person making the jab seems to be someone that could answer the questions just cba to do so.</p>
<p>I know I’m considered to be in the group of <span class="bbcode-i">elitists</span> for whatever valid or invalid reasons. The people to whom I have shared information seem to refrain from that term but those to whom I have snubbed seem to embrace it. I see a pattern.</p>
<p>“If we don’t get spoon fed by you and you mock us, you are an elitist and we hates you”.</p>
<p>So be it. Instead of complaining, read my sig and then learn to read code.</p>

</aside>
<p>The idea behind releasing code to the public is that the public gets the code, not just a group of people who you wish to have the code. I know moparscapers for the large part are genuine idiots who live in a bubble-wrapped world of copy and paste, but not so long ago[sup]1[/sup] the cheating scene revolved around copy and paste tutorials on modifying the client. I must admit that even I used these tutorials, though unlike [some] others, I made a point to find out why something worked.</p>
<p>There are many, much better ways to learn as opposed to learning by reading code tooled to suit runescape cheating. There are essentially two things that you will have a problem with and need to “learn” how to overcome them, what you want to do and how you will go about it. Though looking at code written by other people may help you learn both these things, a self-driven person with a brain will be able to sketch out what they want to achieve and then learn whichever tools he is using in order to complete this goal. If you write your own code, you will (should…) know exactly what is happening and why, if you just leech someone else’s and don’t understand it, chances are that you will just accept the fact that it works and never give it a second thought until it breaks.</p>
<p>One of my bigger gripes with this community is that you all seem to believe that releasing “stuff” will magically solve everything and make the world a happy place. It will not, purely for the fact that many of the people bleating and making a fuss that code should be released wouldn’t understand it even if it were perfectly documented. That said, people who make a fuss when they release code[sup]2[/sup] more often than not release something poorly designed/written/commented and then proceed to claim that it is something that it is not.</p>
<ol>
<li>A relatively short time anyway, perhaps 5 years ago.</li>
<li>You all know who I mean. I have also been guilty of this.</li>

        <p>“Bob” is a “look and don’t touch”, albeit brilliant, person. Eventually he has some time on his hands to surf to a forum in order to view current hot topics in a community that he cares for (though he may be unwilling to admit it.) Seeing a conversation that he believes to be a worthy cause he makes a seemingly innocuos post to influence the direction the conversation is headed toward. Though his argument is wonderfully put, there is something even more special in his post than the words that he painstakingly typed out. Beyond the words, there is the revival of a new idea: footnotes. The application of something so obvious yet helpful seems to have slipped through the cracks of the community. Eventually “Bob” comes back to see that many of the posts after his own contain footnotes, and as a result, “Bob” is able to understand what other people are saying with far more clarity. It seems that both parties have benefited: Bob AND the community.</p>
<p>I personally believe that many of the arguments presented thus far are fundamentally flawed in that they are based on the idea that the said person releasing code is doing it out of the kindness of his/her heart, and can benefit no longer once the code is released publicly.</p>
<p>Releasing code is an investment…plain and simple. If one releases code to a community, they are not only encouraging people that benefit from the code to act in the same manner, but they are also guiding the community toward their idea of perfection. The problem is that one person’s idea of perfection can conflict with another person’s idea of perfection. In some cases, they can combine to form an entirely new (and far stronger) reflection of perfection (ultimately, this is the investment that I speak of).</p>
<p>By releasing code to the masses, one can find that there are two outcomes: the release is a total flop and nobody learns from it, or a special few are able to rise above the general masses and see the code for what it truly is…an investment in their future. When all is said and done, those few in the latter case are able to break out of the norm, destroy circular reasoning, and keep the community fresh with new ideas. Giving birth to new life in the form of ideas is a strenuous task when it really comes down to it,  but if even one of those baby ideas grows up into an adult and gives birth to new baby ideas then it was all worth it; everybody can learn something new.</p>
<p><em>Philosophical</em><br>
Guys, if you have ever wanted to give birth, then releasing your code is probably one of the closest things you can get to doing it. So go ahead and give birth, some of your babies are bound to die, but there’s a chance that a few will survive and follow in your footsteps…</p>
<p>^Has something like that ever been said before? Because that came off the top of my head haha.</p>

<p>I started with my updater using PSB’s and Ollie’s updater. It’s a great way to learn how things are done when you see the code.<br>
Except a lot of people at the cheating scene, only come to leech, not to learn. So releasing something usualy ends up with a lot of flames at you (from the noobs).<br>
However I’m still eternal gratefull to psb and ollie for their work.</p>
