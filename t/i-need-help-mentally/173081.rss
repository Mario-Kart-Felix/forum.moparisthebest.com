    <title>I need help (mentally)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-mentally/173081</link>
    <description>Lately I have been feeling very strange (mentally). I am an overall happy person, I have no reason to be sad/depressed whatsoever. It&#39;s not so much that I am actually sad, it&#39;s more like a placebo of emotion; the more I think of this problem, the more negative I feel. The more nagative I feel, the more I think of the problem. The emotions are not sad, mad, or anything else, they are just...negative. I am a fairly spiritual person, and I am very good at channeling energy. So when I concentrate, I am able to force these emotions out of my being, and pull positive emotions in (sorry if this sounds too hippy-ish). This works, it puts me in a very good mood very fast. However, this lasts for about 10 minutes, and as soon as one minuscule thought of doubt enters my mind, or one small part my consciousness that lacks confidence in the control of these negative emotions becomes appearant, the negative emotions slowly re-enter my consciousness.

This is very aggravating, I have absolutely no reason to be unhappy. My life is great, I have an amazing girlfriend, supporting family, and true friends. It&#39;s odd, because when I am with my girlfriend, I never feel these emotions, and everything seems perfect. I know it&#39;s all in my head, however the human brain can be easily influenced by &quot;whats in your head&quot;, which is why I call it a &quot;placebo of emotions&quot;.

The most irritating part of this is it isn&#39;t something most people could understand, so I haven&#39;t told anyone. So, I&#39;ve turned here.

Edit: Just posting this has helped. I am trying to keep feelings of doubt from entering my mind.</description>

              <p>The Puberty remark isnt really a “smart ass” remark it is actually a reasonable answer. But if you do have these depression problems like you are saying try talking to your school’s guidence program. Or a teacher parent or even a friends parent. Don’t talk to any random friend try talking to a best friend you know a lot. Even though some people seem to be good friends you never know. Your girlfriend might even be a good person to talk to. but if you need to talk to someone ill talk, i have had this problem before. I know that you dont know me andthis might even help. here is my e-mail and aim.</p>

              <p>It’s actually pretty normal to feel depressed for no reason at all as a teenager. I know a lot of people that have done it. Don’t worry too much about it. Just try to do some things that you like to do (playing videos games, listening to music, hanging out with your family/girlfriend) and try to remind yourself that everything is fine. It seems like it’s something that should pass over soon. If it doesn’t, then it might be something to worry about.</p>

              <p>Lately I have been feeling very strange (mentally). I am an overall happy person, I have no reason to be sad/depressed whatsoever. It’s not so much that I am actually sad, it’s more like a placebo of emotion; the more I think of this problem, the more negative I feel. The more nagative I feel, the more I think of the problem. The emotions are not sad, mad, or anything else, they are just…negative. I am a fairly spiritual person, and I am very good at channeling energy. So when I concentrate, I am able to force these emotions out of my being, and pull positive emotions in (sorry if this sounds too hippy-ish). This works, it puts me in a very good mood very fast. However, this lasts for about 10 minutes, and as soon as one minuscule thought of doubt enters my mind, or one small part my consciousness that lacks confidence in the control of these negative emotions becomes appearant, the negative emotions slowly re-enter my consciousness.</p>
<p>This is very aggravating, I have absolutely no reason to be unhappy. My life is great, I have an amazing girlfriend, supporting family, and true friends. It’s odd, because when I am with my girlfriend, I never feel these emotions, and everything seems perfect. I know it’s all in my head, however the human brain can be easily influenced by “whats in your head”, which is why I call it a “placebo of emotions”.</p>
<p>The most irritating part of this is it isn’t something most people could understand, so I haven’t told anyone. So, I’ve turned here.</p>
<p>Edit: Just posting this has helped. I am trying to keep feelings of doubt from entering my mind.</p>
