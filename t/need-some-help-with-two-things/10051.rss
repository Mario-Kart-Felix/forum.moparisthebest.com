right ok<br>
go to client.java and search makeglobalobject then go right down to the bottom of it then copy and paste the code so it should look like this for example  makeGlobalObject(2974, 3372, 2783, 0, 10);<br>

right the first arrow and the second arrow are your corridinas sorry for bad speling the third arrow is the id and if you want to take away a object you have to just take away the makeGlobalObject(2974, 3372, 2783, 0, 10); just delete it ok so there… [br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 23, 2009, 10:57:12 am[/size][hr]srry the arrows didnt come our right the 2974,3372 is the corridnates and the 3372 is the id<br>
