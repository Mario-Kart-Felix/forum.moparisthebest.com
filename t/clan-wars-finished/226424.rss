    <title>~~Clan Wars [Finished]~~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clan-wars-finished/226424</link>
    <description>Okay guys... guess what! After absolutly NO help from anyone on the help forums forcing me to push back my plans for my new Clan Wars, I ended up finishing it without the origional hopes that I had wanted... But nevertheless, I completed a new form of Clan Wars that it totally different from the rest because...

1. It does NOT use the Castle Wars arena
2. It is NOT a shitty remake of Castle Wars
3. It is NOT just a pk box with two flags and two seperate portals so that people can just loot other peoples kills

...no my Clan Wars is actually more rewarding than the other shit version of Clan Wars, and here is what is different about my Clan Wars...

1. The arena is located in the Lava Maze (Blocked off with objects)
2. The rules for this game are TOTALLY different
3. There is an actual PURPOSE for playing this Clan Wars

...okay so you&#39;re probably wondering (if you actually read this far) what is the purpose of playing this game, what are the rules, and will this be good?

Okay so here are the rules for my new Clan Wars...


-You are not allowed to leave after you&#39;ve started playing Clan Wars (you&#39;ll see why in just a second)
-You MUST wear your team cape that was given to you (until the end)
-You SHOULDN&#39;T kill your own Clan Members

How to play Clan Wars...

-You start off at Home and you go through the Clan Wars portal
-You then pick which Clan you are going to go in to
-When you do this, you receive a Clan Cape, and a Clan Ring
-The object of the game is to kill one member from the other Clan and obtain their Clan Ring
-Once you have done this you can then leave through the exit portal * (after you search through the maze to find it)
-Then at the portal, you have to take off your cape and exit through the portal to back to the Clan Wars choosing center
-You will apear in front of the Clan Wars Chest
-When you do, you have to have both rings in your inventory to be able to receive the reward in the chest (500k)
-Once you do this you can then enter in another Clan Wars portal and keep playing...

*There are other options throughout Clan Wars... you don&#39;t HAVE to leave after you kill one person, you can defend/guard the exit portal so members from the other clan can&#39;t escape, or you can kill new members as they enter the clan wars arena, or just simply go on a rampage and kill everyone that you see (remember, you can still get PK points from this minigame), or you can just loot all of the dead players for their stuff...


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well I hope you like my new version of Clan Wars, I&#39;ll post a tutorial on how to add it (how I added this minigame) to your server... 
Thanks,
