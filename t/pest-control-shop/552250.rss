              <p>Yeah you’ve given us very limited information.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/beale">@Beale</a> has told you how to make the items worth points, however I’d recommend doing it within a shop as it can get messy otherwise:</p>
<p>Add this into “public int getSpecialItemValue(int i)”</p>
<p>[CODE]</p>
<p>if (myShopId == 17) {<br>
switch(id) {</p>
<p>case ****:<br>
return “value”;</p>
<p>}<br>
}</p>
<p>[/CODE]</p>
<p>Now in the HandleOtherShop method add:</p>
<p>[CODE]</p>
<p>if (c.myShopId == 17) {<br>
if (c.pcPoints &gt;= getSpecialItemValue(itemID)) {<br>
if (c.getItems().freeSlots() &gt; 0) {<br>
c.pcPoints -= getSpecialItemValue(itemID);<br>
c.getPA().loadQuests();<br>
c.getItems().addItem(itemID, 1);<br>
c.getItems().resetItems(3823);<br>
c.getPA().sendFrame126(<br>
"<span class="mention">@whi</span>@Pest Control Points: <span class="mention">@gre</span>@" + c.pcPoints + " ", 7333);<br>
}<br>
} else {<br>
c.sendMessage(“You don’t have enough Pest Control Points”);<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>[/CODE]</p>
<p>In the BuyItem boolean add:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (c.myShopId == 17) {
				handleOtherShop(itemID);
				return false;
			}</code></pre>
<p>And finally in the buyFromShopPrice method add:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (c.myShopId == 17) {
			c.sendMessage(c.getItems().getItemName(removeId)
					+ ": currently costs " + getSpecialItemValue(removeId)
					+ " pest control points.");
			return;
		}</code></pre>
<p>This now completely handles the shop with the ID = 17 as the pest control point shop if you don’t already have pest control points saved as an integer, go to player.java &amp; add this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Now to save this integer we need to go to playersave.java and search for “rights”:<br>
This will take you down to the first part which you need to edit, I’d scroll down a few under rights and start there but anywhere will do.</p>
<p>Add this:</p>
<p><code>} else if (token.equals("pc-points")) {
						p.pcPoints = Integer.parseInt(token2);</code></p>
<p>Now search for “rights” again but this time add:</p>
<p><code>characterfile.write("pc-points = ", 0, 12);
			characterfile.write(Integer.toString(p.pcPoints), 0, Integer
					.toString(p.pcPoints).length());
			characterfile.newLine();</code></p>

              <p>[quote=“beale, post:2, topic:552250”]Well seeing as I am not allowed to spoon-feed on this forum, I will just give you the basics. You will need to look in shopassistant.java and establish the shop ID and that it requires pcPoints or whatever the int is. Then to set the price, you will see “public int getSpecialItemValue(int id) {” or something along those lines. To set the price of a special item, all you need to do is <code>case *itemID*:
return *amount of points for item*;</code> thats all you gotta do, hope you can figure it out from there. Honestly, if that doesn’t help, you can probably find the code for other special item shops that were already in your source and just copy+paste and change the shop ID and what points it requires. Goodluck[/quote]</p>
<p>Okay and is there a certin number the shop has to be to say points ect… I remember reading something along the lines of if shop id is 14+ it is pk points ect… but my slayer points shop and pk shop are both under that.</p>
