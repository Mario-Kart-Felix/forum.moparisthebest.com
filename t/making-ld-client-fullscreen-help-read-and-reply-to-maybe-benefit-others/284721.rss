    <description>hey moparscapers, just wondering if you can make a LD client fullscreen? maybe you put some stuff from a HD fullscreen client into a LD one, that might work? if so please email me at beanburrito1@hotmail.co.uk. :)




thanks for your help (if you choose to do so)

              <p>there must be a way, surely! maybe if the client is built like a HD client but is coded differently, or something is added to a LD client therefore making it fullscreen? i mean, it has to be possible</p>
