[size=12pt][u][b]Synopsis[/b][/u][/size]

Titanfall is an action packed FPS for Xbox One, Xbox 360 &amp; PC. It has acrobatic first-person shooting and giant robots galore. I am attempting to recreate this as a 2D retro looking platformer.

I know this may seem a little odd and you may be wondering how this would work. Of course this is going to be a difficult challenge. Respawn has created a one of a kind game. But we think we may have a solution of sort for making this amazing game in a 2D way.

[size=12pt][u][b]Servers[/b][/u][/size]

As we all know Titanfall is an online only type of game. We want to do this the same way (with a possible offline mode where no exp is gained). So, we have purchased 3 modern servers just for that. We feel these are more than enough to handle players as well as host the data required. Here are the specifications:


[ul][li]ASUS Z9PE-D16 Server Motherboard[/li]
[li]2 x Hexa-Core Intel Xeon E5-NNNN CPUs with Hyper-Threading (24 cores)[/li]
[li]128GB Registered ECC DDR3-1600 RAM[/li]
[li]Adaptec 6805 w/ write-caching enabled (Zero-Maintenance Cache Protection)[/li]
[li]8 x Seagate 6GB/s 1TB SAS Hard Drives[/li][/ul]


[size=12pt][u][b]Graphics[/b][/u][/size]

We would like to have a retro type feel for Titanfall 2D. As of now we do not have a graphic artist so if you would like to join the team PM me and I will set-up a contract referring to pay and other business.

[size=12pt][u][b]Music &amp; Sound Effects[/b][/u][/size]

We have emailed Respawn in hopes that they will allow us to use the official music/sound effects but still have not received a reply. As of now we do not have a composer so if you would like to join the team PM me and I will set-up a contract referring to pay and other business.

[size=12pt][u][b]Funds[/b][/u][/size]

Funds for this project are very important. Unfortunately it is something we are lacking. This is mainly because of the servers we have recently purchased, so once we have enough of the game done and can create a sample video Kickstarter is where we are thinking of going. We also plan on allowing donations on the website once we set it all up.

[size=12pt][u][b]More About TITANFALL 2D[/b][/u][/size]

The game will be a platform style, fast paced, online shooter. Parkour is going to be implemented with ledges and small obstacles around the map with buildings behind the platforms that you can wall run along.

Of course there will be the three types of Titans including the; Atlas, Stryder, and Ogre.

Burn Cards, all weapons (including titan weapons) and attachments, and abilities are going to be included.
