[url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,181132.0.html]Making Your Own Script[/url]
[url=http://]Custom Code By .Jay Laze - Coming Soon[/url]


[i]Post feedback if your using it please, or I wont give you the right script for this. Dont be lazy, do it for the script![/i]

First, before you use this you have to see how it works:
The link goes to another thread that shows how this javascript run on your website. say if you had only 1 domain, well this javascript makes new special www. domain codes for your website. You could have multible worlds on the same website only they lead to link. Might not look like links, but if you go to the link above, you should learn more about this.

[code=javascript]&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
var cmd=document; var r=0; var clientsecretcodeuse=&quot;/j28s7adw8&quot;;
function e(w,m,s,h,p,l) {
if (r==0) { cmd.write(&quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;); r=1; }
else { cmd.write(&quot;&lt;tr class=r2&gt;&quot;); r=0; }
cmd.write(&quot;&lt;td class=&quot;+(m==0?&quot;f&quot;:&quot;m&quot;)+&quot;&gt;&quot;);
if (s==0) cmd.write(&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;http://&quot;+h+&quot;.urldomain.com&quot;+clientsecretcodeuse+&quot;\&quot;&gt;&quot;+&quot;Client &quot;+w+&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;);
else cmd.write(&quot;Client &quot;+w);
cmd.write(&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;);
cmd.write(&quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot;+(s==0?p+&quot; Noobs&quot;:s==1?&quot;Cut Off Atm&quot;:&quot;Full of Noobs&quot;)+&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;);
cmd.write(&quot;&lt;td class=&quot;+(l==0?&quot;us&gt;WorldNameHere&quot;&quot;)+&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;);
cmd.write(&quot;&lt;td class=&quot;+(m==0?&quot;f&gt;Free&quot;:&quot;m&gt;Members&quot;)+&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;); // 0 free member and 1 member
cmd.write(&quot;&lt;/tr&quot;);
} e(1,0,2,&quot;f4g&quot;,0,0);
&lt;/script&gt;[/code]

[size=14pt][b]What all you need to change[/b][/size]
Today I will explain to you how the Player Counter works. You see, Saturday night - August 4, 2007 I was just randomly looking at runescape sources because I was going to get the cache for the latest client of runescape (Yes that is in my Project Tex &amp; this is why it&#39;s only 2% done). I tryed looking at there applet and found nothing of use to me. So i decided to go backwards at there things and what do I get? My lil bro told me thats now how runescape worlds work. Dude! Wtf, ok look at there source in world sellect part of runescape &amp; tell me if you see god dam &quot;world 20    us east 1    free&quot; writen down. Lol he checked and said wtf! $5 for me XD - anyways let me explain the basics properly, the link above is kinda sloppy to me.

First you need to know a little Java &amp; HTML table tags, if you know this then I garrentee you&#39;ll find the errors above lol. So this is how it works

First there are few variables defined in the javascript &amp; these are for commands, if you know what a string is in java then you should know that these are basically a string.
[size=8pt]
[b]cmd[/b] = The document, this will be used to give command lines for the script.
[b]r[/b] = Defines weather the world is for free players or for member players
[b]clientsecretcodeuse[/b] = is the code you will be using for your clients (Your server worlds)[/size]

[b]The functions[/b]
[size=8pt]Well this is short commands so they are used for serveral things...

[b]E[/b] - Name of function
[b]W[/b] - Telling the script to import &quot;/j28s7adw8&quot; at the end of runescape.com (runescape.com//j28s7adw8).
[b]M[/b] - If the client is members or not
[b]S[/b] - Whats the statue is for the server of the client. Full, Offline or how many connections online.
[b]H[/b] - Imports a www. code into the domain
[b]P[/b] - Connections that are online from the client world.
[b]L[/b] - Server description ID.[/size]

[b]Making The Frame[/b]
[size=8pt]As you can see, I imported tables into it so that the worlds sellect options are organised. When I stated early that &quot;you need to know a little Java &amp; HTML table tags&quot; this is where your HTML skills come in at. 
This command line I will make will determine if the world is free(0) or for members(1). Basically it is to define colors on runescape, but since you probably want have different table colors you should just take the one with [i]else { cmd.write(&quot;&lt;tr class=r2&gt;&quot;); r=0; }[/i] off.
[b]
if (r==0) { cmd.write(&quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;); r=1; }[/b] - r1 is actually saying row 1, meaning another color for that row.
[b]else { cmd.write(&quot;&lt;tr class=r2&gt;&quot;); r=0; }[/b] - this one explains the same as above, but with different color. if you dont have other colors just take this one off[/size]

[b]The Same Here Too[/b]
[size=8pt][b]cmd.write(&quot;&lt;td class=&quot;+(m==0?&quot;f&quot;:&quot;m&quot;)+&quot;&gt;&quot;);[/b] - Is defined weather the world is member version or not. The [i](m==0?&quot;f&quot;[/i] tell the script that it is a free world &amp; that is a value, the m part is another value which is added as a value of 1. If you didnt know that this one was to define a color in the &lt;tr&gt; class then there you go. What this line is trying to say is &quot;Is 0 member?&quot; but then theres f &amp; it tell it &quot;No f is 0, your 1.&quot; [/size]

[b]Players Online[/b]
[size=8pt]This is your main line here! You will need it for your hosted domain. Ever wondered when you copyed the world links you get that .com//l0,p0,j1 at the end of runescape urls? Ever wondered why theres no god dam www. for the server clients? Ever wonder how they manage so many servers without making pages?!?! Well I will tell you how then! They dont make pages, they use a copy of it and let the javascript determine what the url will be for that world. As stated above &quot;[b]H[/b] - This is to import a host line for the client which does not require a www. instead it would use things like y3s. instead of the www..&quot;, this H is defined as Host Line. yes the main thing you edit is the host line, without that you would be importing the same client saying its a different world all the time. No it isn&#39;t - someone logs on your server and will still be on the same world as you. I know how to make  multiple worlds without having to copy the files, but I want give you that info until later on.

this here is basically a command line example to write down the world which string e uses.
if (s==0) cmd.write(&quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;http://&quot;+h+&quot;.urldomain.com&quot;+clientsecretcodeuse+&quot;\&quot;&gt;&quot;+&quot;Client &quot;+w+&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;);

[b]s[/b] - The amount of players online that are using the domains client to play
[b]+h+[/b] - This is the server domain the client is on, that helps let players in the certain client.
[b].urldomain.com[/b] - This is the url of your domain such as .Noobscape.com
[b]+clientsecretcodeuse+[/b] - Imports server client code that you customly make yourself (for your clients)
[b]+&quot;Client &quot;+w+[/b] This will give a short word called Client like below you list will be displayed like.

World 1	FULL	US West 1	Free

@ - This will give a short domain like this: [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,181132.0.html]World[/url]
@ - &amp; +w+ defines the world number which you use to tell the list what world it is. [/size]

[b]Server Statues: is it Full, cut off or online?[/b]

[code=javascript]cmd.write(&quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot;+(s==0?p+&quot; Noobs&quot;:s==1?&quot;Cut Off Atm&quot;:&quot;Full of Noobs&quot;)+&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;);[/code]

[size=8pt]For this we will need to determine if the client is full of players(0), turned off(1) or is online(1). If your world is full then it will tell the client that it is Full if controller turns the client off it will print as offline &amp; wont be clickable anymore(for full too) the : you see in there stand for OR by the way meaning its thinking the client is offline or full.

People who know this probably think this is for countrys, no its really a description on the client.

[code=javascript]cmd.write(&quot;&lt;td class=&quot;+(l==0?&quot;us&gt;WorldNameHere&quot;&quot;)+&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;);[/code]

[size=8pt]
l==0 is what that description is, if we wanted to change that all we have to do is change the 0 to 8 &amp; it would display WorldNameHere after. Thing about that is the l is really a selective code number now the us&gt; variable is use to display the images of that but if you wanted to change that you would have to copy the files [url=http://www.runescape.com/css/main/server-3.css]here[/url] &amp; search us that is what put up the images then after that you&#39;ll put what that image represent.

[b]Is this client for members or free players?[/b]
This is to determine if the client is free or members

[code=javascript]cmd.write(&quot;&lt;td class=&quot;+(m==0?&quot;f&gt;Free&quot;:&quot;m&gt;Members&quot;)+&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;);[/code]
[size=8pt] m==0 meaning the world is free + the added object too which gives the value of 0 another number (that then becomes 1), if you have more you could do it like this though:[/size]

[code=javascript]cmd.write(&quot;&lt;td class=&quot;+(m==0?&quot;f&gt;Free&quot;:&quot;m&gt;Members&quot;:&quot;us&gt;USA&quot;)+&quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;);[/code]
[size=8pt]And now since I added another the value of 1 would turn to 2 meaning.[/size]

[size=8pt]0 - [img]http://www.runescape.com/img/title2/membership_benefits.gif[/img] Free 
1 - [img]http://www.runescape.com/img/title2/create.gif[/img] Member
2 - [img]http://www.runescape.com/img/gamewin/usflag.gif[/img] USA - The 1 I added XD[/size]

[size=8pt][b]Closing the function network[/b]
Finally were closing this dang operator for the script. All you have to do is add:
[code=javascript]cmd.write(&quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;);[/code]
at this &amp; then were off to making the script work! XD Once you add that your done for that &amp; only 1 line away from this! This is telling the script to close the table down after being used.

[b]Creating the statue client links[/b]
Remember the function we learned about yesterday? Thats like guidance:[/size]
[code=javascript]function e(w,m,s,h,p,l)[/code]

[size=8pt]If you dont know what these are then here is a guide for you:

E - Used for making the world client domain.
W - Client Number
M - Client Type (Free or Member)
S - Client Statues
H - Host code
P - Players online
L - Desciption ID[/size]</description>
