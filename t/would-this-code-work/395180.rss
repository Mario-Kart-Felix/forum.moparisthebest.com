    <title>Would this code work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-this-code-work/395180</link>
    <description>Okay on my server there&#39;s a bunch of fags who somehow get their character look as -300 or -120 when the regular settings are suppose to be from 0 to... 50.
This is a regular character&#39;s looks:

[LOOK]
character-look = 0	0
character-look = 1	0
character-look = 2	18
character-look = 3	26
character-look = 4	33
character-look = 5	36
character-look = 6	42
character-look = 7	10
character-look = 8	0
character-look = 9	0
character-look = 10	0
character-look = 11	0
character-look = 12	0

This is someone who has a nulled character&#39;s looks (which causes everybody in that player&#39;s radius to freeze):

[LOOK]
character-look = 0	13
character-look = 1	0
character-look = 2	0
character-look = 3	82
character-look = 4	30
character-look = 5	113
character-look = 6	-82
character-look = 7	-12
character-look = 8	0
character-look = 9	0
character-look = 10	0
character-look = 11	0
character-look = 12	-34


Still having this problem, feel free to help or if your a mod for some reason looking at this, just remove it.</description>
