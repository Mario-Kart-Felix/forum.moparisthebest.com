new barrows style for runescape 2012
Overpowered Npc for real Runescape effect
Most of armors are up to date with current Runescape stats[/b][/center]

My Problem is that there&#39;s to many errors in the client so i was not able to fix most of those ints and login interface was
all hybrid Everything involving the Client.java file does not effect the server when i compile so if some of you can help me fix this that would be awesome.

          <blockquote>
              <p>I’m not going to create an application simply because of the ideas you have for your server, but I would like to help you make your application format better:</p>
<p><code>Coding Experience: This is okay.
What other server have you worked with: This doesn't come close to mattering when you are working with one standard form of language.
Email Address: This is okay.
Do you know how to make a webclient through jarring/signing: This is okay, but is probably one of the most simplest things anyone could learn.
Which would you consider your best 317/508/600+: Once again, this is something that doesn't matter. Revision does not change the language you use.
On a scale of 1/10 what you say your at for coding: This is pretty much just a re-worded form of the first part of the application format.</code></p>
<p>Anyways, good luck on your project.</p>
