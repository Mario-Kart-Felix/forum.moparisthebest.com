    <title>New hoster.. Quickly!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-hoster-quickly/344582</link>
    <description>The hoster than i currently have is fuckin everthing up and says the server is 24/7 and it like 1/7 lol.

Anyway.. All i am looking for is a guy/girl who will RUN the source on there computer 24/7. i can give u the IP etc. It willt ake like 5 minutes to setup.

Its a WEBCLIENT so no need for client. And i can just send you the Source.

Msn?
