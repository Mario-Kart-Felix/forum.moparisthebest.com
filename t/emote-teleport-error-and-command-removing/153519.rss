    <title>Emote teleport error and Command removing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/emote-teleport-error-and-command-removing/153519</link>
    <description>ok well, i wanted to change one of the emote teleport from my source, so i went into client.java, searched the current coords, and just changed them to the new spot. now when i compile i get the error...

client.java:17226: illegal start of expression
                                     teleportToX = ;


i dont remember changing anything but the numbers of the coords, and i dont see how this could make an error. i moved the &#39;;&#39; around and it still is the same error. any help would be great.




also, ive decided to remove all commands from my server, so that it will have a better economy etc, and when i searched client.java for all the command names and stuff, i took it all out with no errors, basically removed everything that had to do with it, and after saving compiling and running, the commands work! you can type ::silab1 and go to the quest tab, scroll down, and click &#39;silab1&#39;. both of them still work. pleasee help me out here, ive been struggling for days with this.</description>

              <ol>
<li>“teleportToX = ;”? How can a number equal “;”?</li>
<li>Go to:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void customCommand</code></pre>
<p>and delete everything in between the “{” and “}”. Make sure you’re compiling the right thing.</p>
