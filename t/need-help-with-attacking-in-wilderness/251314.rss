    <title>Need help with attacking in wilderness</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-attacking-in-wilderness/251314</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using richscape&#39;s source released oct. 28... and i don&#39;t know if it originally had this error, but when your attacking in the wilderness it will keep attacking until they attack back then it like will reset your attack. then you click on them again and it resets their attack. 

I&#39;ve must of accidently deleted something or added something to cause this.... but i have absolutely no clue and i&#39;ve been trying to fix it for a while now.

So could anyone help me out? :confused:</description>
