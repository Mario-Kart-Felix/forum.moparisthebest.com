    <title>Players Able to Move Through Walls by Following or Attacking :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/players-able-to-move-through-walls-by-following-or-attacking/396591</link>
    <description>All I&#39;m wondering is how to clip a little section of the map so that if the player clicks to follow a player on the other side and click to attack them, they do not just run over the map and through the walls :)  Hope someone can help meh

Thanks,
