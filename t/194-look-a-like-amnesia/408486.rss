Read my post actually, don't just look at my pictures.
Its plainly written that I said I know smite wasn't in the 194 revision but I wanted it added, so I did. 
<blockquote>Wow, looks good so far Acorn. I like how you can barely see the characters eyes and that's about it. No other facial features to speak of.</blockquote>
I'm not sure if this is sarcasm or not to be honest, but thank you lol.

<p>Pretty sure this is delta based.</p>
<p>Goodluck, and adrians wasn’t a leech bro, he was showing pics of what was on the server already. It’s called a project, he isn’t going to have a bunch of his own features right when he starts rofl.</p>
</blockquote><br>
This is not delta or PI, also the reason I say Adrian’s is a leech is not because of his pictures but what he says hes “done” already.<br>
Hes done nothing but added running everything else he said he added was already in his source which is called leeching which I’m not a fan of supporting.

<p>OT: Good luck with the development, be sure to check back into this thread after a while, don’t quit on this mate.</p>

Thank you, also I won’t be quitting this anytime soon you can be assured I might possibly take a week break from it in the near future to finish up my current development but that’s about it.

<p>Read the thread before you post, I already mentioned that. RuneScape is shit now, thus not very fun. If you find a decent RSPS it can be a lot more fun. While your comment seems to be related, it’s actually not at all. There’s two completely different reasonings behind them.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p><em>facepalm</em> nevermind…[/quote]</p>
<p>God damn I hate ignorant people like you. The reason behind RSPS is to have fun, since RuneScape is no longer fun. So the difference between a RSPS and RuneScape is… Fun. :hurr:</p>
<p>The difference between a 194 look-a-like and a real 194 isn’t fun. They can equally fun. The difference is just that one’s a cheap-knock off and less impressive. RSPS are knock-offs as well, the difference being they’re more fun than the original. That’s not the case here (depending on who made them and how they were made).</p>
<p>I suggest you leave before you make yourself look even more ignorant.</p>
