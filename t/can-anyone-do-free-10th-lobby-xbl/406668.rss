<p>Through system link, people do it free all the time because it is free to host them like that. For actual Challenge lobbies people charge because they have to use Keyvault to host them. Keyvault can cost anywhere from 20$ to 200$, depending on what they are being used for.</p>

Isn’t it used to unban your gt?[/quote]<br>
Consoles.  Basically every console has a unique keyvault.  When someone gets console banned, its the keyvault that is banned.  A J-Tagged Xbox has the ability to read &amp; overwrite the keyvault.  So some people will copy the keyvaults from their unbanned Xbox, and sell them to people who have banned keyvaults so they can unban their consoles.</p>

              <p>This is off topic but i suggest you don’t do it, hacking imo is stupid and  lame and its just so much more fun knowing you worked for your gear and prestige’s, rather then getting it all in one day, being a fake like everyone else, and wasting money.</p>
