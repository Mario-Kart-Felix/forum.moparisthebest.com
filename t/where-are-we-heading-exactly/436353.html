        <p>It’s a question one should always ask himself, it is vital we all stay on course with our interests. Probably like yours, my interest is to make this community an active and safe environment which can be sustained. Now I understand I’m not perfect, nor are any of us, but that does not mean for one second that we can not succeed in achieving these goals. The only real failure is when you stop trying. So I present to you my plain text plan on how I think this community should be steered:</p>
<p>First of all, allow me to identify the main problems currently damaging the server:</p>
<ol>
<li>PVP</li>
<li>Taking too long to upgrade</li>
<li>Arguments</li>
</ol>
<p>I will now go over each point in details,</p>
<p>1)PVP - This server isn’t PVP at all anymore, I know this because I’m the founder of the society which rules it. New people join, they die, they quit. The process is repeated over and over we need a world without PVP, just a vanilla server where one can build legit. Perhaps W2?</p>
<p>2)Taking too long to upgrade - I’ve said this many times now, this is a genuine problem, all the servers that have 50+ players have upgraded ages ago. I’ve put forward various ideas to help this situation. Please don’t think I’m joking either, Moparisthebest, the server activity went from 20 on to 2 when the new update came out.</p>
<p>How are we ever going to grow the community like this? My point in regards to a community developer, using less plugins, and utilizing choice still very much stands active. (Speljohan offered to do everything and offered to negotiate with MITB about it)</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Arguments - Not to be rude, but since Davidi2 has gone there seems to be a hell of a lot less of these, but the general arguments and fall outs between players now seems to be about PVP (As they just want to build) so that goes back to my point of turning PVP off in one world (Don’t say residence is a solution either, it isn’t).</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll be honest, I’ve had many arguments with staff and players but I’ve now wised up a little more and have been inspired by Mopman and Lothy to shun people instead. As I’ve said before, we’re not here to baby sit everyone.</p>
<p>I see this as my responsibility to make this community work, if it doesn’t then that’s on me, I’ve written a books worth about this place just in this section, never mind the others.</p>
<p>I want to perfect an absolute master plan for fixing these matters, and more that crop up, then I’m going to <span class="bbcode-b">personally</span> make sure it’s solved, no matter what. You have my word on that. Mopar has the potential to have hundreds of players, yet we hold our selves back on silly systems and pointless plugins.</p>
<p>No more I say!  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

        <p>[left]Generally speaking it seems like everyone wants pvp they get it, then get rid of it. Then everyone wants pvp again. We want creeper explosions oh wait no we don’t, oh wait, yes we do. Because everything is mostly decided on by the community e.g annoying people who shouldn’t have a say because they are not the ones that have to deal with the fallout.</p>
<p>I’m just saying this to make it official but I’m also against multiple worlds. There could be 3 people online but it might as well be a shared single player world if their all in separate worlds. We’ve been stretching our player-base thinner and thinner during a time in which the player-base has been record low. It’s great that we can cater to everyone’s specific world taste but it just isn’t working because of the low server population. I know the whole multiple worlds thing isn’t going to be scraped because of all the recent work that went into setting it up</p>
<p>However I’m sure we can get more people whenever MITB gives the go ahead to start the advertising even tho we keep falling behind with upgrades.<br>

        <p>I’m with you on the multiple worlds, Moparisthebest seems to go off on his own parade when it comes to that. Honestly, we need one world, one set server ideas.</p>
<p>That allows quick upgrading as well. On your advertising point, even if we could get more people, how long would it last? A week tops? By the time we upgrade the new update is out which links back to the issue of over using plugins such as multi world and so on.</p>
<p>Put shortly, we’re trying to be more than we can handle. The issue we now have is the fact Moparisthebest won’t remove the world, oh the joys =/</p>

<p>Thank goodness someone else sees this as well, it’s not a new problem either, it’s one we have had from the very beginning, and I’m not sure what the solution is.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@multiple</span> worlds, I don’t much like it either, but I see it as far preferable to deleting everyone’s hard work and starting over every few months, which is the only other option that I see.  Certainly people would like that far less.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@upgrading</span>, I also don’t see another option, should we start trying to upgrade constantly with super-buggy alpha versions of bukkit? Or just wait until a recommended build comes out so we can have reasonable assurance that the server will be somewhat stable.  About speljohan updating some plugins, I don’t think he is interested at all as I sent him a PM a few weeks ago about something that should be even easier for him to do, and he never got back to me.  Not to mention it wouldn’t get us bukkit any faster than the team of developers that already knows what they are doing working on it.</p>
<p>So, PVP off in w2?</p>

        <p>That’s why we need to stop being so democratic on every single issue. We need a server which is consistent in what it offers, not changing every 3 months.</p>

<p>Refer to above point, from my point of view being active in PVP myself, I would argue people only argue for PVP when they become bored with what the rest has to offer. PVP adds the adrenaline rush to situations, the fun once they’ve ran out of things to do. An example of this is when W2 started, nobody killed anyone, as it progressed and the map was filled up it turned into a slaughter house. So what we really need to do to keep an active player base is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn PVP off, BUT offer a fun experience still.</li>
</ol>
<p>This can be a fair game, just basic minecraft. So we need to have good management over those who break the rules. We need to provide sufficient space for building, and stop cheaters. Just a reasonable server is enough to cater with. The reason why people keep changing their mind is because we do what they want, we have a mixed player base, if we stick one to thing only those who like the way it works will play which fixes the problem of them changing their minds so often.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Upgrade quickly</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll speak to Speljohan myself, but as I said on negotiable terms. I don’t know what he will want, but I imagine the time frame would be good based on his experience. The more successful MC servers have their own developers to cater for their own needs which provide upgrades a thousand times faster than Bukkit deliver. Those communities are nothing compared to the size of Mopar as a group. Yet we seem to have a player base of a 12 year old who’s hosting a server for his friends on his mothers computer. By the time we’ve upgraded we reach 20+ players for a week, then it just crashes to zero. It’s no good having 20 active people on for 3 weeks a year.</p>

        <p>Is it possible to have a PVP zone? people ony get pissed when ganked and items are stolen. But when people agree to PVP its alot of fun for everyone.<br>
I like the Pvp Day night thing thats installed. Have alot of people been compaining about it? I get the felling that people like it. I think the low Pvp is just due to low member numbers.</p>
<p>As for only 1 world. I don’t see how we could go to 1 world without making people mad. some live in w1 some in w2 and some now only in Creative. Most have main house in W2.<br>
I will bring it up again but making a payment system for W2 would put more people in it. It would add prestige and/or privilege and a sense of accomplishment of being there. I remember wondering in W1 when I stated and how when I got to W2 how I was now invested.</p>
<p>Just my thoughts</p>

        <p>I’m not sure where you get that feeling from <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Last week 3 people left due to it, they just wanted a world to get a long with everyone. That ideal word being world 2. PVP is effectively bullying now, who can kill people the most.</p>

<p>Also, needs more teleport abilities. I’m not doing that. normal rollback = messy</p>
