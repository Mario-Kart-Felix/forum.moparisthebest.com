    <title>Im thinking about buying a MacBook Pro</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-thinking-about-buying-a-macbook-pro/361513</link>
    <description>I am thinking about buying a 13 inch mac book pro. I am going to college next year, I want something small but reliable with good specs. I don&#39;t have all the money atm but I will in about a month or so. 

The question is should I wait for the next lineup of MacBook pros to come out or buy the 13inch from the current model to come out? Do you guys have any idea if the new lineup will be release before Christmas? Because I would like to buy the most recent model but I want to get it before Christmas. Also, don&#39;t try to convience me not to get one, I have already made my mind up. I am just trying to figure out if I should wait or not.</description>

              <p>Well it sees like they are supporting new and new hardware every month. A month ago when I tried it, my audio chipset wasn’t supported but with the new version of VoodooHDA my audio is supported. This driver wasn’t made by apple ethier. Almost all nVidia cards are supported by one of the nvidia drivers, and it seems almost any processor is supported anymore. There was no support for AMD in the native kernel but so many modified kernels are out now that you can’t get a fully working system with ease. The only thing with not much support is ATI and Intel graphics, but still a lot of ATI and Intel graphics work.</p>

<p>Not really, Linux is focused more on working on a wide range of systems with the most basic of functionality, then you customize to fit your system. Mac OS X is meant to work on just a minute number of systems, built by Apple. That just so happen to be similar to other PC systems, There are some bits of Hardware that will just never, ever, work with Mac OS X. Whereas if you buy a decent machine/popular one. You’ll more than likely have the majority of compatibility, minus a couple hindrances like missing audio in your case. But if you’re not one of the lucky ones, to have gotten a machine that is similar, then you’re shit out of luck in the osX86 game.</p>

<p>Blender is not a bad program for normal people, but in the workplace it doesn’t work. It has nowhere NEAR the capabilities of, say Maya. There are plenty of things I can do in Maya in seconds that would take much longer in Blender, not to mention MEL and integrated Python means I write quite a few scripts to get things done quicker.</p>
<p>And the same with every other Linux equivalent of a professional app.</p>

<p>On a side note, I just spent 3 days getting snow leopard on my AMD computer. So much extra shit was involved in that like using a modified kernel and other shit. Also, I didn’t even get my sound to work because the driver for it is beta and isn’t working for my audio chipset. I am buying a $15 dollar usb audio adapter off newegg though so that will take care of all my problems. Lucky apple added ATI’s 5850 and 5870 to there new lineups otherwise I would be shit out of luck on that, but now I have a good working hackintosh with full graphics capabilities so I’m not to impatient for getting the macbook. I will just get it when I get enough money. Lets hope that any new updates don’t screw up my setup.</p>

Wrong.</p>
<p>Linux doesn’t work on my pc. I’ve tried Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Debian, Gentoo and FreeBSD, none of which stay up and running for more than half an hour. Windows 7 on the other hand… Stays up for weeks![/quote]</p>
<p>First of all, FreeBSD runs on the FreeBSD kernel and not the Linux kernel, it may not run on your computer, I don’t know.  But the bottom line is Linux does run everywhere, from computers, to cell phones, to TVs, to VOIP phones, to satellite and cable boxes, to refrigerators and toasters.  I can also guarantee that if your computer runs windows or OSX it will also run Linux.  So I’d try it again. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>We know Linux is brilliant. But it is different, sometimes unexplainable as to why for my day-to-day usage, I’d rather use OSX or Windows (7) than Linux. There is consistency, support from companies who are obliged to ensure all works, and I need that my main operating systems.</p>
<p>Linux on a desktop is constantly improving loads, but overall, it isn’t at the level of OSX or Windows for usability and consistency. Not yet, and due to the way distributions are developed, it likely won’t ever be. You’re clearly fine with that, you don’t see a problem - that is completely fine, but a bit of objectivity wouldn’t hurt, would it?</p>
<p>This community isn’t stupid, people here aren’t computer illiterate and they do know what they’re buying. People here have used it all (mostly) and can make their choices based on good experience. It isn’t really stupid or a waste to buy something you prefer to use.</p>

<p>That isn’t even close to a valid argument, a better analogy to cars would be the choice between a $25,000 Chevrolet truck or a $50,000+ Cadillac truck.  Both are made in the same factory, with the same parts, both capable of exactly the same thing.  The difference is the Cadillac is shinier and looks fancier, people go ‘oooh, it’s a cadillac’ when in reality, it’s identical to the Chevrolet and your an idiot for paying double the amount for the same vehicle.  I would and do make fun of people who pay for ‘Cadillac’ or ‘Lincoln’ versions of a Chevy or Ford truck, the same way I do for people who buy ‘Apple’ versions of an everyday PC that costs twice as much and is capable of exactly the same thing (OSX is ‘supported’ on it, being the ONLY difference).</p>

<p>Yes but you’re getting a 13" laptop. So you’ll deal with it until then.</p>
<p>And if you’re only planning to leave it hooked up to a large monitor, you might as well buy an iMac or a desktop Mac.</p>
<p>If not, you will be carrying it around somewhere, and you might be using it for FCP etc. and it will not be fun lol.</p>

There are some Hackintosh setups that are fairly similar to real Mac’s. A friend of mine put his in a Mac Pro case, and it’s almost identical hardware to a real Mac Pro.<br>
