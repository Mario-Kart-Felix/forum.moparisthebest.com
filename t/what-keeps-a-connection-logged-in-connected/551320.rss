    <title>What keeps a connection logged in/connected?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-keeps-a-connection-logged-in-connected/551320</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not great with all the protocol and player updating but I&#39;m trying to work on some AI for experience with real connections.

I can get the connections to connect and the player spawns, but the player disconnects shortly afterwards. Is there something I need to do updating wise to keep this connection active? I can&#39;t see any errors displayed with the connection in the client or the server.

I was thinking maybe because I haven&#39;t made it constantly send data to the server and times out because it&#39;s idle?

Any help is appreciated.</description>

The client does need to constantly receive data so it doesn’t time out, but I don’t think it can be any data. I’m pretty sure it needs to receive the player update packet every cycle.</p>
