    <description>OK so i get all these error messages saying no responce from server, server is offline blah blah blah.

i double checked everything that you can possibly check

my java is jdk 20 and the run server says this when i hit edit

[code]@echo off
@title Server
cd Server
java -Xmx512m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.20-ga-bin.jar server[/code]

heres some pics that i made when i double check everything
