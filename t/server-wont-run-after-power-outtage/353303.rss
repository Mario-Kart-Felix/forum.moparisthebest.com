    <description>There was a big storm in my area and it knocked out power for like 12 hours and my server obviously went down.. I tried to run it, it says server is online but it still says error connecting to server, I checked my ports with PfPortchecker and it says they are both open.. Please Help!</description>

              <p>Yeah well I do have a Dynamic IP I have an Actiontec MI-424-WRv2 Router with Verizon ISP, but I reset my router config and re-portforward and the PfPortchecker still says they’re open ports, maybe my DNS server changed or something?</p>
