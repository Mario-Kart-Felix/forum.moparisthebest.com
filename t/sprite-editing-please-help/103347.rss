              <p>No, it’s not done with those little sideicon changers, or prayer icon changers. But before I get into that, this belongs in client hacking.</p>
<p>And to do that, you will need to get a cache unpacker. I don’t have one, very little people do, I do know where you can get an extractor, but I forgot where it is. It’s in moparisthebest somewhere. Then you need to find the right thing in the unpacked cache and edit it. If it is a model, you’ll need a model converter to convert .mdl files into something else and then a model editor to edit the converted type of file, because Jagex’s .mdl can’t just be opened with a .mdl editor, because I’ve tried. And then once you find the right one, you need to edit it. And then if it isn’t a model, you need to find what folder it really rests in and then find the proper program to open it. Then once you’re finished with that, you have to find a repacker. I don’t have one, little people do, and I don’t know where you can get one. Once you make one, or somehow get one, you need to repack the cache and voila you’re finished.</p>
