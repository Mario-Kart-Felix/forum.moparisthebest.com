He released the source code and said

&quot;I was never going to continue it and decided it would be best to have others improve on it than just have it rot on my desktop&quot;

I really want to continue and upgrade this source code but I am struggling and need help.

Please comment below if you are interested in this project and would like to help! I need someone who can help me with Java.

(BTW, im not another 10 year old with a dream... Im 18.)
