              <p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:17, topic:333821”]Chris, you’re scraping at straws… As you can see (and know) I was blatantly, BLATANTLY fucking around. There was what, 4-5 people in that conversation, all of which were Mopar members, one of which was you and one was Swo0osh, the other administrator and a mate of mine… Just by the way I was typing you can obviously see it was a clear fuck about, if any of you actually frequent IRC you will know but whatever. Conveniently you crop the exact part that makes it look bad… Paste the whole conversation and let it be read in the context it was written in. Also bare in mind that when the above was taken you had 6 players online, including the 5 of us in that MSN conversation, whilst running on EasyRSC… I do believe in that exact same conversation I was giving you advice on what to do, was I not?</p>
<p>Fact of the matter is, numerous people have approached me telling me what current deal you’re offering to advertise/attack/inconvenience RSCEmulation (or in particular myself). Every moderator on both RSCEmulation and RSCAngel are sick to death of banning your little followers who are being paid to advertise/spam/attack whatever you can in an attempt to leach more members from us. Again, conveniently, two of the reported IP’s are your personal IP AND the exact IP your server is hosted on, but I guess they must have been faked. Right?</p>
<p>It’s all well and good and claiming you wanted to know if Staminus host me or not but literally all Staminus IP’s begin with 72.20.<em>.</em> and that doesn’t explain why you would need to know what port RSCEmulation is running on… and why would you move people on the channel and say, “I don’t want any1 hearing this”[/quote]</p>
<p>My Staminus IP starts with 69, As you see in my signature. Ill shut my server down if you find proof that im paying anybody ANYTHING to advertise, etc… Including in game items and cash. Like i said 10 times already, I DONT ASK OR TELL ANYONE TO GO ON ANY SERVER TO ADVERTISE! They do it on thier own, And will continue to as you keep posting these idiotic paragraphs. I have no intention on telling them not to advertise on your server either. I like the new players. Stop crying.</p>

              <p>Yep, Someone came in my vent talking about attacking servers, Then attacked mine. People asked him to try RSCE, And he did. Not me obviously, And why would i try to stop someone from doing that to luke? All he has done was be immature towards me in the past.<br>
Also, Whoever recorded this obviously thought that this section was the most incriminating towards me. Where do i Ask him to attack? Somebody said that Luke switched to a VPS, So i had Them check by resolving the IP. The IP address comes with the client on the RSCE home page. It’s public. He was just too lazy to get it himself to Resolve it. The guy who asked for it clearly isn’t the one who attacked, And i Clearly said Nothing about any attacks, Only about the server he was on. Nice try though.</p>

(This is everything i said in this video)<br>
72.30.32.58<br>
Andrew, can you check if that’s a staminus ip?<br>
Here, It’s right there, In my comment<br>
Well he said he might be on a vps, I just wanted to check real quick.<br>
Ii dont know, the last i talked to luke, he told me he was paying like $800 per month and he had like a $2500 package or some shit.</p>
