    <title>[Question] Difference between Delta and PI?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-difference-between-delta-and-pi/461311</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been working with a blank 317 Delta source for a few weeks now, and it&#39;s nice and I&#39;ve got a pretty good grasp on how to work them. My question is, what&#39;s the difference between Delta and Project Insanity? It seems as if it&#39;s packaged/bundled differently, and the syntax seems to be a bit different. I was thinking of switching to PI, what&#39;s the difference and which would you recommend? I&#39;m not releasing a server, I&#39;m doing 317s purely to better my Java knowledge, so please don&#39;t comment saying, &quot;677, 722, 728&quot; shit like that.. Thanks! - The Web Guy</description>

Imo pi is much easyer to work with then delta…[/quote]</p>
<p>Clean deltas like randqm’s blakes and mine do not have 70% of the content in client.java</p>
<p>PI is for lazy ass people who just leech everything.</p>
