    <title>Keeping Viruses off you Computer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/keeping-viruses-off-you-computer/25428</link>
    <description>As this is a community of well... cheaters I thought that you guys might want to learn a bit about viruses and protecting your computer. (Also please note that this is made mostly for noobs because I assume that most of the older members are aware of most of the info here.)


This is an informative thread about how to keep your computer safe from malware and viruses. And just for those who don’t know malware is a combination of malicious and software—in other words bad stuff. Malware is basically viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, adware, keyloggers, backdoors, e-mail viruses, boot sector viruses, companion viruses, macro viruses, logic bombs, and XXSV (Cross Site Scripting Virus) all in one word. (Those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head… Maybe I will add more later.)

[u]Anit-Virus Programs[/u][url][/url]

Obviously the first form of defense would be some sort of anti-virus program. First of all I would like to warn everyone that Symantec’s Norton Anti-Virus is NOT the way to go. It is possibly the most used anti-virus out there, and therefore was the main target for “black hats” or hackers or whatever you want to call them. So most malware is coded just to go right around Norton when it comes looking for possibly infected files. Also there is almost no way to get it off your computer unless you delete the registry value. So here is a list of some anti-virus programs:

[i]AVG Free Edition[/i]
http://www.softpedia.com/get/Antivirus/AVG-Free-Edition.shtml 

[i]NOD32 Trial Version[/i]
http://www.nod32.com/download/trial.htm 

[i]Spybot[/i]
http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-Destroy 

[i]Spy sweeper[/i]
http://www.download.com/Webroot-Spy-Sweeper 

[i]Spyware Doctor[/i]
http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Popup-Ad-Spyware-Blockers/Spyware-Doctor.shtml 

[i]Xoftspy[/i]
http://www.xoftspy.co.uk/ 

[u]Web Browsers[/u]

The second way you can make your internet safer is to blow up IE. It doesn’t matter if you have IE1 or IE7, your gunna get screwed because of it. IE was created with the philosophy of trust (ya right) so there are many security flaws and exploits out there. And since about 90% of internet users use IE it is a prime target for the “black hats.” And I guess I will be using that term from now on since I don’t have a better word. Anyway… the BEST replacement for IE would be [i]Mozilla Firefox[/i] which can be downloaded here: 
http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=firefox-2.0&amp;os=win&amp;lang=en-US 

Another web browser is [i]Opera[/i] which can be downloaded here: 
http://www.opera.com/download/ 

Now for some tweaking of those web browsers you have…
This applies to any web browser you have. Even if you just downloaded Opera or Firefox or if you are still using IE. First if you are really paranoid about malware you can turn you security up. And despite all those warning I just gave you I am using IE for these instructions so tweak them a little to match the browser you are using.
1.	Click Tools Internet Options
2.	Click Security. Set it to High. (Or click Custom Level under the slider to adjust it to your personal settings.)
3.	From this screen you can also edit the list of Trusted and Restricted sites.
4.	Now click on privacy. If you are extremely paranoid you can set it to Accept no Cookies, but that’s for stupid people (no offence). I’d set it to Medium or Low.
5.	From this screen you can also click the Block Pop up button.
6.	Last is to go to Advanced.
7.	Under Browsing look down the list until you see Install On Demand (IE) and Install on Demand. (Other) Tick both of them off.
8.	This will keep your browser from automatically downloading programs that may be needed to view different forms of media. 
9.	(If you are using IE make sure to tick off IOD for sure. If you are using Firefox it asks you to prompt before it installs so you can leave that on as long as you check what your installing.)

[u]Downloading[/u]

If you are going to download a file that someone posts or from any other source and you suspect it of having a virus scan it with one of theses:

[i]Jotti[/i]—Best one
http://virusscan.jotti.org/ 

[i]Virustotal[/i]
http://www.virustotal.com/flash/index_en.html 

With these links you can scan your computer without installing anything:

[i]Sygate[/i]
http://scan.sygate.com/ 

[u]Email[/u]

I don’t know much about viruses being transmitted through Email (well actually I just don’t feel like typing it) but to stop most spam or other unwanted emails you can:
1. Find an email provider with good spam stoppers or whatever
2. Download this: [i]Thunderbird[/i] (a very powerful email program made by the developers of Firefox.) http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=thunderbird-1.5.0.8&amp;os=win&amp;lang=en-US 

[u]Limited Accounts[/u]

You can also make a limited account on your computer. Meaning not an Administrator. If you want even better security make a limited account with only limited rights. Only use this when surfing the net. The purpose is to stop yourself from downloading potentially dangerous files and to stop certain things from auto downloading. I personally have not done this but it is useful if you have a stupid brother or something.

[u]Pop Ups[/u]

Pop ups are very annoying for sure. Sometimes they give you …. suggestive images (porn). But the NEVER can harm your computer simply by popping up. Obviously sometimes if you click the links or play the games they give you could get some crap on your computer. But mostly they are for advertising and annoying the shit out of you if you have some sort of Trojan dropper and you get a pop up ever 1 min. The easiest way to get rid of this is to download Opera or Firefox. (Links above for those of you who are too lazy to read the whole thing.) You can also get so sort of toolbar that has a pop-up blocker (www.google.com/toolbar) You can also get some sort of other pop up utility.

[u]Firewalls[/u]

And last but not least are firewalls. These are your best and foremost protection against online viruses. The best of which is [i]Zone Alarm Pro[/i]. Or Zone Alarm for the free version. 
This can be downloaded here: www.zonelabs.com This includes a pop up blocker so if you download this and have some other type of pop up blocker utility uninstall it. (The utility not Zone Alarm.)


NOTE:
I will update this more when I have time, but right now my brain is fried since its 2 in the morning and I just thought of all that off the top of my head. Except for the links for websites. And last I would like everyone to contribute to this thread. IE: post some links for other programs or stuff you like or use.</description>

              <p>As this is a community of well… cheaters I thought that you guys might want to learn a bit about viruses and protecting your computer. (Also please note that this is made mostly for noobs because I assume that most of the older members are aware of most of the info here.)</p>
<p>This is an informative thread about how to keep your computer safe from malware and viruses. And just for those who don’t know malware is a combination of malicious and software—in other words bad stuff. Malware is basically viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, adware, keyloggers, backdoors, e-mail viruses, boot sector viruses, companion viruses, macro viruses, logic bombs, and XXSV (Cross Site Scripting Virus) all in one word. (Those are the ones I can think of off the top of my head… Maybe I will add more later.)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Anit-Virus Programs</span></p>
<p>Obviously the first form of defense would be some sort of anti-virus program. First of all I would like to warn everyone that Symantec’s Norton Anti-Virus is NOT the way to go. It is possibly the most used anti-virus out there, and therefore was the main target for “black hats” or hackers or whatever you want to call them. So most malware is coded just to go right around Norton when it comes looking for possibly infected files. Also there is almost no way to get it off your computer unless you delete the registry value. So here is a list of some anti-virus programs:</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-u">Web Browsers</span></p>
<p>The second way you can make your internet safer is to blow up IE. It doesn’t matter if you have IE1 or IE7, your gunna get screwed because of it. IE was created with the philosophy of trust (ya right) so there are many security flaws and exploits out there. And since about 90% of internet users use IE it is a prime target for the “black hats.” And I guess I will be using that term from now on since I don’t have a better word. Anyway… the BEST replacement for IE would be <span class="bbcode-i">Mozilla Firefox</span> which can be downloaded here:<br>

<p>Now for some tweaking of those web browsers you have…<br>
This applies to any web browser you have. Even if you just downloaded Opera or Firefox or if you are still using IE. First if you are really paranoid about malware you can turn you security up. And despite all those warning I just gave you I am using IE for these instructions so tweak them a little to match the browser you are using.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click Tools Internet Options</li>
<li>Click Security. Set it to High. (Or click Custom Level under the slider to adjust it to your personal settings.)</li>
<li>From this screen you can also edit the list of Trusted and Restricted sites.</li>
<li>Now click on privacy. If you are extremely paranoid you can set it to Accept no Cookies, but that’s for stupid people (no offence). I’d set it to Medium or Low.</li>
<li>From this screen you can also click the Block Pop up button.</li>
<li>Last is to go to Advanced.</li>
<li>Under Browsing look down the list until you see Install On Demand (IE) and Install on Demand. (Other) Tick both of them off.</li>
<li>This will keep your browser from automatically downloading programs that may be needed to view different forms of media.</li>
<li>(If you are using IE make sure to tick off IOD for sure. If you are using Firefox it asks you to prompt before it installs so you can leave that on as long as you check what your installing.)</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Downloading</span></p>
<p>If you are going to download a file that someone posts or from any other source and you suspect it of having a virus scan it with one of theses:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Jotti</span>—Best one<br>
<a href="http://virusscan.jotti.org/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://virusscan.jotti.org/</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Virustotal</span><br>
<a href="http://www.virustotal.com/flash/index_en.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.virustotal.com/flash/index_en.html</a></p>
<p>With these links you can scan your computer without installing anything:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Sygate</span><br>
<a href="http://scan.sygate.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://scan.sygate.com/</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Email</span></p>
<p>I don’t know much about viruses being transmitted through Email (well actually I just don’t feel like typing it) but to stop most spam or other unwanted emails you can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find an email provider with good spam stoppers or whatever</li>
<li>Download this: <span class="bbcode-i">Thunderbird</span> (a very powerful email program made by the developers of Firefox.) <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=thunderbird-1.5.0.8&amp;os=win&amp;lang=en-US" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=thunderbird-1.5.0.8&amp;os=win&amp;lang=en-US</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Limited Accounts</span></p>
<p>You can also make a limited account on your computer. Meaning not an Administrator. If you want even better security make a limited account with only limited rights. Only use this when surfing the net. The purpose is to stop yourself from downloading potentially dangerous files and to stop certain things from auto downloading. I personally have not done this but it is useful if you have a stupid brother or something.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Pop Ups</span></p>
<p>Pop ups are very annoying for sure. Sometimes they give you …. suggestive images (porn). But the NEVER can harm your computer simply by popping up. Obviously sometimes if you click the links or play the games they give you could get some crap on your computer. But mostly they are for advertising and annoying the shit out of you if you have some sort of Trojan dropper and you get a pop up ever 1 min. The easiest way to get rid of this is to download Opera or Firefox. (Links above for those of you who are too lazy to read the whole thing.) You can also get so sort of toolbar that has a pop-up blocker (<a href="http://www.google.com/toolbar" rel="nofollow noopener">www.google.com/toolbar</a>) You can also get some sort of other pop up utility.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Firewalls</span></p>
<p>And last but not least are firewalls. These are your best and foremost protection against online viruses. The best of which is <span class="bbcode-i">Zone Alarm Pro</span>. Or Zone Alarm for the free version.<br>
This can be downloaded here: <a href="http://www.zonelabs.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.zonelabs.com</a> This includes a pop up blocker so if you download this and have some other type of pop up blocker utility uninstall it. (The utility not Zone Alarm.)</p>
<p>NOTE:<br>
I will update this more when I have time, but right now my brain is fried since its 2 in the morning and I just thought of all that off the top of my head. Except for the links for websites. And last I would like everyone to contribute to this thread. IE: post some links for other programs or stuff you like or use.</p>
