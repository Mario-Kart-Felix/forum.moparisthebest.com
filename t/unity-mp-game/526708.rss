    <title>Unity MP game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unity-mp-game/526708</link>
    <description>This is just something im working on in my spare time, hopefully the end result will be a co-op game but I have not named the thread because im unsure of the final design. I posted this in other games because that other Naruto game is here and it&#39;d be an insult to call unity programming.

Currently im building a basic networking game system and then bringing that over to a co-op Amnesia type game. So I&#39;m going to be working on all the main features before actually fleshing out the game. If you haven&#39;t played my first &quot;horror&quot; game check out: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,587255.0.html


No im not using any tutorials. I watched a few but realized their approach to networking was not cheat-proof so I&#39;ve built this from the ground up as authoritative. I&#39;m also not using unities auto transform sync because its nasty.

This is being built as a general multiplayer base so I can adopt it to any project*


Right now I have (everything below all works in multiplayer):
- Full player connecting
- Items, ammo 
- missile launcher for the lulz, it explodes also
- basic AI system (may swap out for a node-based navigation system if needed)
- AI has health, takes damage, and delivers damage
- chat system


The hard part is pretty much done so the rest has been fairly simple. I&#39;m keeping track of almost all stats now I just need to draw it lol, hopefully starting the inventory soon.


Heres some screenshots of my beautiful testing area:

I&#39;m using unity free

<p>That’s true. Plus most of the people in our generation have been desensitized so much by scary movies, books, stories, shows, etcetera. If not co-op you’ve already made a single-player game like that, yes? Might as well go with the other idea then I suppose.</p>

Well im just rolling with the RPC calls for now, but I haven’t really been limited with it at all. I’ve made sure to disable any attempt at unity auto syncing stuff for me by disabling it in the networkView mostly because its a p2p update function and caused tons of issues and I had very little control.</p>

              <p>This is just something im working on in my spare time, hopefully the end result will be a co-op game but I have not named the thread because im unsure of the final design. I posted this in other games because that other Naruto game is here and it’d be an insult to call unity programming.</p>
<p>Currently im building a basic networking game system and then bringing that over to a co-op Amnesia type game. So I’m going to be working on all the main features before actually fleshing out the game. If you haven’t played my first “horror” game check out: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,587255.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,587255.0.html</a></p>
<p>No im not using any tutorials. I watched a few but realized their approach to networking was not cheat-proof so I’ve built this from the ground up as authoritative. I’m also not using unities auto transform sync because its nasty.</p>
<p>This is being built as a general multiplayer base so I can adopt it to any project*</p>
<p>Right now I have (everything below all works in multiplayer):</p>
<ul>
<li>Full player connecting</li>
<li>Items, ammo</li>
<li>missile launcher for the lulz, it explodes also</li>
<li>basic AI system (may swap out for a node-based navigation system if needed)</li>
<li>AI has health, takes damage, and delivers damage</li>
<li>chat system</li>
</ul>
<p>The hard part is pretty much done so the rest has been fairly simple. I’m keeping track of almost all stats now I just need to draw it lol, hopefully starting the inventory soon.</p>
<p>Heres some screenshots of my beautiful testing area:</p>
<p>I’m using unity free</p>
