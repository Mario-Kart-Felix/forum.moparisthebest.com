    <description>if you get something like
&#39;[u]java not found[/u]&#39;

right click on the compiler and change the jdk to your version.

if you get something like
&#39;[u]javac not found[/u]&#39;

you need to re-download your jdk and register it so that the javac.exe file is saved.

if you get sumthin like
&#39;[u]100 errors[/u]&#39;

your missing a bracket, if you have no idea where to put it then just undo what u did last.

hope this helped :D</description>
