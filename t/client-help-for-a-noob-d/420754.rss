    <description>Hey everyone. I&#39;m pretty new to this owning and editing rsps and I have some questions that I would really love to be ansered. Now some of these may be easily fixed but I just can&#39;t figure them out. Ok so...

1. On my server I have changed many thing there there are 4 statements that won&#39;t change. -teleport to (different server name) home -forums are found at www.prevscape.com [there rly found at prevscape.freeforums.org] -when your finished playing runescape [I want it to say my server name] -www.(different server name).com

Now I have looked in almost all of the different notebook files and can&#39;t find them. Is there a cretin section where I can find these in? [yes when searching through the notebook files I click &quot;edit&quot; and &quot;search&quot; so I don&#39;t pass the words]

2. When I spawn a item how to I get it to stay when I log out? I know this is prob pretty easy to do so PLZ don&#39;t spam me... I just don&#39;t know how. I can do npc&#39;s (roughy) but not objects

3. How to I make a tele in the spell book go to a different place. Example) say instead of teleing to fally I want to send it to evil bobs island. Or if I just want to add a teleport to a cretin place.

4. How to I put my server on media-fire for people to download (also how do I put it online for the public?)

5. If I have a item that is supposed to be a hat but is used as a wep how do I make it so I can wear it as a hat. Example) I have a gold party hat and when I wear it it says I&#39;m using a weapon 

6. Can someone give a link for some good custom items? I have some good customs but I&#39;m looking for some rly crazy and cool items like different color eles and things like that.

Thank you to anyone who can help me with these problems!!! :D</description>

<p>This is in your source, so it would be in Client.java</p>

<p>This is in your source also, Client.java,</p>
<p>search: addGlobal<br>
and then under there follow the layout, I believe the layout will be:</p>
<p>Obj, X, Y, Z</p>
<p>obj- being the object ID<br>
X being the x location<br>
Y "                        "<br>
Z "                        "</p>

<p>This would be found in clickingmost.java or clickhandler.java or some shit along those lines.<br>
Look up the coords of where the tele take you, then replace thouse with where you want the tele to go instead.</p>
