<p>Take the appropriate drugs and maybe you can develop a feel for dubstep and rave music.</p>

<p>I don’t think I need drugs to like music you twat</p>

</aside>
<p>Precisely. If you need drugs to make the music enjoyable, then it’s shitty music.</p>
<p>“Fuck you, the music is great. The drugs just enhance how it feels, and it loosens you up”<br>
That is certainly laughable. At the end of the day, all you have are a bunch of drugged out rave kiddies, waving around glowsticks, wearing glow-in-the-dark bead jewelery, and being completely drugged out, to the point where they take more drugs, to lessen the “crash” of the drugs that they just took.</p>
<p>“That’s only some people, that’s not me”<br>
You probably have longer-than-normal hair, black or blond, probably either much skinnier than you should be, or 20-40 lbs overweight, severely friend-zoned by the girl that you are going with, hoping that maybe, just maybe, you’ll see her tits pop out of her low cut shirt (if she’s wearing anything more than a bra), or sneak a peak of her “honeypot” while she’s dancing because, hey, the music is loud, she won’t notice right? After of course you make a move, and get severely rejected, you take another hit of “molly” (or MDMA for those of us whose IQ’s are greater than our ages), and dance the night away, becoming even more dependent on MDMA to feel better, eventually becoming dependent on it, and requiring more and more for you to feel “normal”.</p>
<p>“You don’t have any idea what you’re talking about”<br>
And you are ignorant to the facts right in front of your face.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t need to take any form of drug to enjoy music, nor do I cover myself up in glow in the dark body-paint or clothing and start throwing down some moves. I will say though, in my personal experience that some drugs do enhance your mood and actions when you listen to music. But eh, to you I suppose that’s laughable.</p>
<p>No, no, no and no. Initially I’d like to think why you assume if someone likes dub, house or trance you must be a Skrillex look-a-like, but then I realised you’re an absolute fuckpig. Also I’d like to point out breaking a statement down to “Hey, you’re friend zoned and guess what? You won’t ever get a girl!11” is quite poor.</p>
<p>You sure do know how to spout some absolutely stupid claims and then try to disguise them as “facts”, but eh I guess that’s just ignorance.</p>
<p>Also, just a quick note on the “hurr you said a slang term for MDMA you must be a moron” thing - Do you refer to <span class="bbcode-b">every</span> drug by its name, or do you just single out Molly because you’re yet again a fuckpig.</p>

<p>Alright, now you’re in my territory. It’s not much of ‘death metal’ anymore, that was prominent throughout the late 90s early 2000s, along with screamo, so don’t go there. Nowadays you’d be referring to metalcore or hardcore, similar but different. Emo is also completely different. Calling a person ‘emo’ has never been correct in anyway. It started as a genre of music a group of hipsters established a fashion to go along with it that you now consider emo.<br>
[/quote]Mmhm. And also just cause you listen to hardcore/metalcore doesn’t mean your emo either… &lt;.&lt;[/quote]<br>
but it does indicate you have an acquired taste for shit music!</p>
<p>OP: nope, i’d rather not get gangraped.</p>

That is certainly laughable. At the end of the day, all you have are a bunch of drugged out rave kiddies, waving around glowsticks, wearing glow-in-the-dark bead jewelery, and being completely drugged out, to the point where they take more drugs, to lessen the “crash” of the drugs that they just took.</p>

You probably have longer-than-normal hair, black or blond, probably either much skinnier than you should be, or 20-40 lbs overweight, severely friend-zoned by the girl that you are going with, hoping that maybe, just maybe, you’ll see her tits pop out of her low cut shirt (if she’s wearing anything more than a bra), or sneak a peak of her “honeypot” while she’s dancing because, hey, the music is loud, she won’t notice right? After of course you make a move, and get severely rejected, you take another hit of “molly” (or MDMA for those of us whose IQ’s are greater than our ages), and dance the night away, becoming even more dependent on MDMA to feel better, eventually becoming dependent on it, and requiring more and more for you to feel “normal”.</p>
<p>“You don’t have any idea what you’re talking about”<br>

<blockquote>Lads consider themselves to be the "battlers" of Australia, and are almost ALWAYS extremely patriotic, though still respect and admire English "Chav" culture (which is highly similar) and American "Gangster" culture. Which means they listen to anything (music-wise) from American Gangster Rap, R'n'B, Australian Rap, Chav-Rap, Hardstyle, Techno, etc, though varies depending on the Lad's personal interests and taste.
Seeing as these teens are extremely patriotic towards their flag, they have often extremely racist towards others of different nationalities, ie Lebs (whom very often dress extremely similar), Asians, Arabs, etc. There are numerous recorded bashings from young Caucasian males whom fit the description of lads, to boys of other races. But more often than not, these Lads are still friendly with another races. Lads are notorious for participating in many crimes, such as stealing and often find themselves banned from the shopping centers they loiter in large groups (often in gang colours) in front of.
Lads are also known for their use of Pig Latin, which some can in fact speak fluently and understand very well. People commonly associate them with the words, "Eshay Adlay" which means, "Hes Lad".</blockquote>
