[I] 
RuneEngine is a new source created from scratch &amp; coded in a totally different manner. It&#39;s a very powerful, clean yet complex source. Most of which is not from scratch, like at the moment playerHandler &amp; client, once we finish up on the other classes they will be wiped &amp; coded from scratch. The engine of the source is a C++ application compiled (world.class, listener.class, packetWriter.class, packetReader.class, packets.class, packetHandler,class) with natives, using a command line to compile the rest of the class&#39;s into the engine, keeping the server running beautifully.[/I]

[I]There&#39;s still talk over whether RuneEngine will be released for free. This is still a matter of discussing it thoroughly with the rest of the team.[/I]

              <p>Firstly, the java guru award is given to Java programmers who post stuff in the moparisthebest section, provided what they make is good.</p>
<p>Secondly, Jaywalker is the only person on that list that I don’t see as an incompetent big mouth. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Thirdly, Winterlove’s source and all of these other sources are shit. Hate to be the one to tell you sweety but this won’t be any different. As for IP banning me from your unmade server, be my guest. I won’t be missing out on much, presuming this toy does get off the ground.</p>
<p>Finally, you should stop talking yourself up so much. I can tell you, from experience, that people who gloat about being oh so good are usually completely incapable. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Oh and as for your work: It’s messy, ugly, and doesn’t even follow conventions that most people learn from day one. Now be a good boy and don’t reply to this. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

yes…but does “Dune” have access to it, and if so i would like him to post…<br>
along with the pics of his so called “server”<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Sadly, he does have access to it. Not because he’s good, but because he’s friends with Anime.[/quote]<br>
That is the sad part…he probably can’t code to save his life…let alone get a full 455 client and 456 server (or whatever he has)</p>
