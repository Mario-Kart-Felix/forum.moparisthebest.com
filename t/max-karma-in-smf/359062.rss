    <title>Max Karma in SMF</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/max-karma-in-smf/359062</link>
    <description>I did post this on MSCP, and I was given the correct code, but it doesn&#39;t work, and not to many people seem to look through the General Questions over there.

Anyways, I was trying to set a limit on Karma to 100.
I was given
[code]if ($user_karma_good &gt; 100)
  $user_karma_good = 100;[/code]
but it doesn&#39;t seem to work, as I can still give over 100 REP.
I&#39;ve already seen
http://www.moparisthebest.com/downloads/Karma.phps
so don&#39;t point me in that direction, please.

EDIT: SMF 1.1.11

If anyone could give me further help, I would be very thankful.

Thanks,
Ryan</description>
