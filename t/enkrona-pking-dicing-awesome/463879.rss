-----Gear info-----
Today a very confusing update was released that has items put into classes of how rare they are the order from least rare to most rare is shown below.

orange&lt;green&lt;purple&lt;yellow&lt;blue

red items are non-tradable.

orange items are common. and DEFAULT some items may be expensive but have not been added to the colors listed about and will remain orange. please post any questionable items here with a picture. if you think its more rare then take a screenshot and post here.

an orange item:

Green items are slightly rarer than the orange items they are usually pretty common but worth a little more. they are classified as uncommons.

a green item:

purple items are usually pretty valuable they are classified as rare items.

a purple item:

next are Yellow items yellow are classified as Epic items and are some of the most rare items in the game. worth more than rare items they are some of the best items int he game aswell. normally discontinued items are yellow due to the fact that they can not be obtained anymore.

a yellow item:

Blue items are the rarest items in the game usually very hard to obtain and are very very good. these are classified as Mythic items and there are very few of them.

a blue item:

Red items are items that cant be traded although valueless they are still pretty neat :D

a red item:

The newer AC shop
[img]http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/3090/acshop.jpg[/img]

-----MODES-----
This part is very important. when you first log onto an account you will
be given the option of 2 different game modes.

these modes vary in their abilities

the first is easy, easy is the fastest training mode..basically just lets
you max out your stats very fast. but the downside is you dont hit as well
as the other mode and your drop rates are reduced


the last option is extreme, these are very slow training but they have some bennefits
along with never losing prayer they are also blessed with higher drop rates
and hitting more often and slightly higher than mediums!

so choose wisely when you start your account. although you can always make
a new one :)

              <p>Today a very confusing update was released that has items put into classes of how rare they are the order from least rare to most rare is shown below.</p>
<p>orange&lt;green&lt;purple&lt;yellow&lt;blue</p>
<p>red items are non-tradable.</p>
<p>orange items are common. and DEFAULT some items may be expensive but have not been added to the colors listed about and will remain orange. please post any questionable items here with a picture. if you think its more rare then take a screenshot and post here.</p>
<p>an orange item:<br>
<img src="http://img831.imageshack.us/img831/3660/orangemf.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Green items are slightly rarer than the orange items they are usually pretty common but worth a little more. they are classified as uncommons.</p>
<p>a green item:<br>
<img src="http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/2459/greentiu.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>purple items are usually pretty valuable they are classified as rare items.</p>
<p>a purple item:<br>
<img src="http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/4650/purplew.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>next are Yellow items yellow are classified as Epic items and are some of the most rare items in the game. worth more than rare items they are some of the best items int he game aswell. normally discontinued items are yellow due to the fact that they can not be obtained anymore.</p>
<p>a yellow item:<br>
<img src="http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/2820/yellowlk.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Blue items are the rarest items in the game usually very hard to obtain and are very very good. these are classified as Mythic items and there are very few of them.</p>
<p>a blue item:<br>
<img src="http://img577.imageshack.us/img577/8127/bluefv.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Red items are items that cant be traded although valueless they are still pretty neat <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
