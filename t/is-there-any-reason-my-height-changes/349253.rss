    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-any-reason-my-height-changes/349253</link>
    <description>i try to tele anywhere and it changes my height.
except when i tele to home.
but it wasnt doing that a minute ago.
i teleported to castle wars and then tried to tele home but my height was like 3.
so i deleted my account and made another one and now whenever i tele anywhere except home my height will go up.

              <p>Find the commands you used to get to the place where it changed your height. It would say like</p>
<p>teleportToX = 1000;<br>
teleportToY = 2000;<br>
heightLevel = 3;<br>
Change the 3 to 0 if you want to be on the ground.</p>
