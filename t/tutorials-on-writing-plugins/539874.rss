    <title>Tutorials on Writing Plugins</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tutorials-on-writing-plugins/539874</link>
    <description>With the current build of the new base that we will be utilizing when everything is in place I feel like it would be wise to release some tutorials on writing plugins. There were a few concerns when we originally started this project about using Ruby as the official language for people to script in. So I want to start a discussion about how to best approach how to educate people on the bare amount of Ruby they will need to know.

1). Should we write tutorials on the plugin API and if so how should we present them to the public?
2). How deep into teaching people the language should we go?
3). Should we follow a model in all of our &#39;official plugins&#39; that we present in the tutorial in the hope that people follow them?
4). There was a suggestion by Spades on releasing a badge aimed at those who help write content or updates for the server. Do you think that can be a reality?

I think the hardest part of the plugin system will be getting people to install Ruby, Ruby development kit and all the required gems + MySQL (or SQLite) in order to set up their server environment correctly. Its a huge barrier for people but to blunt on the production server this isn&#39;t much of a challenge I just fear it will turn people off if its not a one click download.

Here is an example plugin script and database seed script:

[code=ruby]
module Woodcutting
        def self.included(base)
                base.extend(ClassMethods)
        end

        module ClassMethods
                def trees
                        [ :normal, :oak, :willow, :maple, :magic ]
                end

                def hatchets
                        [ :bronze, :iron, :steel, :mithril, :adamante, :rune, :dragon ]
                end
        end

        class WoodcuttingPlugin &lt; Plugin::Base
                include Woodcutting

                info :authors =&gt; [ &#39;sinisoul&#39; ], :description =&gt; &#39;The woodcutting plugin is responsible for handling when menu options to cut down trees is handled.&#39;

                def load
                        bind :object, :action =&gt; &#39;chop down&#39;, :ids =&gt; ids, :callback =&gt; :chop
                end

                # Callback for when menu action &#39;chop down&#39; is selected
                def chop(mob, target, route)
                        start_action(:routed, mob, :init =&gt; init, :target =&gt; target, :route =&gt; route, :radius =&gt; 1, :delay =&gt; 4, :immediate =&gt; true) do
                                unless chopped_down? @target

                                        # Get the required chance of getting a log from the base chance for the log type and woodcutting level
                                        chance = info(:chance, @type) + (@mob.get(:woodcutting_lvl) + 1) * 0.20

                                        # Roll on the chance for getting a log
                                        if rand(100) &lt; chance

                                                # Add item here TODO

                                                # Add the woodcutting xp to the mob

</aside>
<p>It was the scripting language I preferred to use because I enjoyed a lot of the language level features before I was working on the official server (RuneEmulator project). I didn’t have a larger audience in mind at the time since I was the only developer. I still feel like the current system in place is easy to utilize and that’s why I haven’t though about changing it.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:3, topic:539874”]1. Include example usage in the class-level docs.<br>

<p>Alright. I feel like this is an important piece of the project because if the tutorials are helpful and set a good example of practices then we can expect a lot of the content generated to be good enough quality to be on the production server which would save the development team a lot of time in regards of what they have to do.</p>
