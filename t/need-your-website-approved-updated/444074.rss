    <title>Need your website approved? [Updated]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-your-website-approved-updated/444074</link>
    <description>All website advertising on this forum must be preapproved by a moderator. There were no exact grounds as to how this worked, until now. If you want your website to be approved for posting, simply post your request application in this board and discuss it with the staff. We will either approve or deny your request and you will know why we made our decision (since you will be able to see the mass majority of our discussion).

All previously approved websites prior to the creation of this board are no longer approved. They must be sent back through this system before they can be approved.

[b]Update: [/b]Only websites related to rsps development need to be approved. General websites such as github, pastebin, google, youtube, and any other website not related and not censored may be posted freely. This is not to say you can just post a topic advertising it, though (unless it&#39;s entirely relevant). This last part depends on per-section rules.

Post any concerns you have for this system in this topic. Thank you!

<p>Not quite. The website approval concept existed before this board did, yet it wasn’t enforced well on the RSC side. It’s not too big of an issue right now, either way. We are going to discuss the idea of approving websites in much greater detail in the coming weeks, so don’t be too focused on any sort of ‘hidden motives’ you think exist behind this board.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you have any suggestions or concerns about how this board is run, feel free to post a topic in it and we’ll discuss it privately.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>To post it on the forums you would need it to be approved, but as far as I know having your forums link or a link to another site is an exception the the advertising rule.</p>

              <p>All website advertising on this forum must be preapproved by a moderator. There were no exact grounds as to how this worked, until now. If you want your website to be approved for posting, simply post your request application in this board and discuss it with the staff. We will either approve or deny your request and you will know why we made our decision (since you will be able to see the mass majority of our discussion).</p>
<p>All previously approved websites prior to the creation of this board are no longer approved. They must be sent back through this system before they can be approved.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Update: </span>Only websites related to rsps development need to be approved. General websites such as github, pastebin, google, youtube, and any other website not related and not censored may be posted freely. This is not to say you can just post a topic advertising it, though (unless it’s entirely relevant). This last part depends on per-section rules.</p>
<p>Post any concerns you have for this system in this topic. Thank you!</p>
