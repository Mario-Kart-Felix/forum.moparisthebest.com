    <title>How to change start stats to 99?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-change-start-stats-to-99/154013</link>
    <description>Hi I am using the RuneScape 3 client, and I was looking through the player.java file and I cannot figure out which area to change to make the starting stats 99 (not all, just the combat ones). If you could just tell me which area to modify that at, I would be greatful! Thanks![br][size=1]Posted on: October 24, 2007, 07:53:43 PM[/size][hr]Anyone?</description>
