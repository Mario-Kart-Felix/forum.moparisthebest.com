    <description>please note:this is my furst help secton. and i hope it might help you. if you have any questions please post at the bottom



For some time now some of the new compilers havnt worked for me. then i discoverd a lost thread that had 1 for jdk v6.3

first step for compiler is to make a new text document. name it compiler.bat. htne put this code in it
&lt;blockquote&gt;@echo off
echo Ghost&#39;s Simple Compiler
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_03\bin\javac.exe&quot; *.java
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_03\bin\java.exe&quot; server
pause&lt;/blockquote&gt;


That will fix your compiler for the new jdk verson 6.3


Another problem i had was with my run.bat. I was trying to get a auto restarter that would work but i couldnt find any.

You need to make a text document called run.bat and put thsi code in it

&lt;blockquote&gt;@echo off
color 0a
title ProjGhost pkz
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_03\bin\java.exe&quot; server
pause&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and then you can start it up perfectly.


if you want a working auto restarter goto this download site.

              <p>You would not need to “make a new text document” because the people who are reading this have a compiler.bat and run.bat and they would need to right click and hit “edit” then delete everything there and paste that in.</p>
