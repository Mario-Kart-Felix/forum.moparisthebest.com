    <title>Need help with client downloading</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-client-downloading/263003</link>
    <description>I need help, I dont know if this is where this belongs. But when I download a client something always pops up that asks me what I want to open the file with, I can&#39;t get around it I need help, I am not really good with computers so you&#39;ll have to bear with me. Any suggestions? And I have the Moparscape 3.2 w/ Aryan Client and it freezes on servers sometimes alot.</description>
