    <description>1) Is this the correct way to change my webclient&#39;s client class&#39; preloading model method when I want to get it from the cache because I always get a loading error. 

[CODE]
public void preloadModels() {
  File file = new File(&quot;c:/.ROAR_Cache/Raw/&quot;);
  File[] fileArray = file.listFiles();
  for(int y = 0; y &lt; fileArray.length; y++) {
   String s = fileArray[y].getName();
   byte[] buffer = ReadFile(&quot;c:/.ROAR_Cache/Raw/&quot;+s);
   Model.method460(buffer,Integer.parseInt(getFileNameWithoutExtension(s)));
  }
 }
[/CODE]

2) Anyone know why a custom item would become invis when added? It is not becomes I did not uncomment the preloading method.
a. When I added the spirit shield set, for some reason, all of them seemed to work except the Elysian Spirit Shield, which I do not understand why and i checked it over a few times. The Elysian SS would be invis when u wear it, but when its in inventory or on floor, it appears.
b. Same thing happened with the amulet of ranging. But it appears when worn and dropped, but is invis when it is in inventory or item equipped.

I heard that changing the ID helps somethings, I was wondering why this was the reason and if its not cuz of the ID, how can I fix it?

3) Some like body armor looked weird when you wear them. Like the whole body isn&#39;t covered. I added all PVP armor and they all worked fine, except the Vesta&#39;s chainbody, which doesn&#39;t cover the arms. I found the fix and it was because of the namingi, so now I am wondering why if you name an item a chainbody, it covers parts of the body and platebody, it covers all.</description>
