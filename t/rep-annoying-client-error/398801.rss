    <title>[REP+] Annoying Client error..?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rep-annoying-client-error/398801</link>
    <description>So, I have started randomly getting these errors whenever I try to run any clients. The client I am getting this error on, is the #474 client released with Hyperion #474. I&#39;ve tried everything, and cannot seem to fix this. I&#39;m sure it is something stupid; however, there is no need to flame the topic, or freak the hell out because I cannot fix this. So, chill out. If you have an answer, please reply. If not, keep your annoying comments to your-self. Thank-you.

The Error:

My Client folder layout:

My Batch File Code:
[code]@echo off
cd bin
java Client 1 live live highmem members english game0
pause[/code]

I truly don&#39;t understand what the error could be, everything seems to be correct. I&#39;ve tried placing the batch file in the class and java folders, and changing the paths, and nothing seems to work. Like stated in the title; rep++ will be given to the person who helps, thanks!</description>
