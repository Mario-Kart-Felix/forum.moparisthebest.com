    <title>[PI] Deimos - looking for testers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-deimos-looking-for-testers/549995</link>
    <description>[url=http://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Deimos/deimos.html]Deimos[/url] was a god in Greek mythology, personification of terror.
[size=8pt]Previous work: [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,631858.0.html]Allstar Reborn[/url].[/size]

I started this project a while back, wanting to make an enjoyable PI.
It&#39;s got a lot of standard PI Content, and some custom content. I&#39;m currently looking for a few
people to test it out, help me with finding &amp; fixing bugs, suggest ideas etc.

I also hope to meet some chill people (maybe a website dev), and hopefully have Deimos go public eventually.
