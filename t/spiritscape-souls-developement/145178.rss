    <description>[center]Spiritscape Soul[/center]

[center][IMG]http://i131.photobucket.com/albums/p284/Money_Maker_photos/soul.jpg[/img][/center]

Whats up ya&#39;ll after getting bored of doing nothing after school i decided i want to learn some more java. I got a winterlove source and am now using it for Spiritscape Soul.

Heres what i&#39;ve done over the past few days:

Started working on Server. September 16 2007
50% Runecrafting works(only in abyss). September 16 2007
Levelup Handler. September 16 2007
Commandhandler. September 16 2007
Announcement GUI September 16 2007
changed 50% runecrafting to 90% September 20 2007




What i&#39;m planning on doing:

Make 100% runecrafting Make talismans teleport you the altar when used on ruins and zammy mage tele to abyss
adding a banhandler.
Castle Wars,
Pest Control,
Home-made mini-games,
cooking handler,
combat handler,
All skills working 100% like rs,
add a couple spiritscape twists =P
Add wilderness ( may need help with this in the future)
Magic handler.
Adding Global objects handled

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Will add more to that list.

also i want to code a client with an amazing game frame and very interesting models =)

The client will come last.


I may need help with the client so i may hire client coders, afterwards.

When I&#39;m hoping to release around christmas time.

If anyone would like to assist me in coding please fill out this application:

I will post several videos on the server such as runecrafting once I&#39;m done.
