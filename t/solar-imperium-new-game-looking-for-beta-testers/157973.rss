    <title>Solar Imperium - New Game looking for Beta Testers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solar-imperium-new-game-looking-for-beta-testers/157973</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m a new member but I&#39;ve been around this community for quite some time.  I&#39;m just posting to let you guys know that I&#39;m doing a call for anyone interested in helping us beta test it.  It&#39;s an empire building game, which can be very addictive, so consider yourself forewarned :)

If you&#39;re interested in joining the beta just visit [url=http://games.gamegimp.net/solarimperium]http://games.gamegimp.net/solarimperium[/url] and register and then join the current game going on.

We&#39;ve got a few other games under development that will be needing testing shortly, so now would be a good time to get started beta playing if you enjoy this sort of thing.  

Thanks for your time,

              <p>Well it is beta.  I’m more focused on the the actual mechanics of the game rather than how it looks right now.  However, the layout on the frontpage is completely different than once you are in game.  What would you suggest as far as looks go?</p>
