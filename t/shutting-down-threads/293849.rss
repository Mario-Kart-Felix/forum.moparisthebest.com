    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shutting-down-threads/293849</link>
    <description>It&#39;s enough with the shutting down servers and sites threads. No one is getting shut down and no one has gotten shut down. Calm down, this is really not that bad. If you can&#39;t handle yourself and you think this is illegal/too illegal for you then you should just leave, don&#39;t come around trying to scare all the newfags.</description>

<p>I know. Why would you pay for an item on a Private Server? And donations for ITEMS is fucking retarded. If the user wants to donate to help the server, or help pay to keep the VPS or something, that’s one thing. But if the user donates because they KNOW they will get some kind of reward, That’s just ridiculous.</p>

              <p>I couldn’t care less if they shut down every single server that sell items. I really don’t agree with donations for items either. Shut 'em down Jagex.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

              <p>You know, Jagex shutting down all the servers that sell shit wouldn’t be a bad thing. Infact, it’d be a great thing. RSPS were made for fun, but now they’re just being made for money. That there, is failure.</p>
