              <p>My comments were constructive as they suggested you should work on making a better wireframe and blending colors better.</p>
<p>You should take a look at some of the better models here for examples on better wireframes and then compare it to your models. See where you can improve and etc.</p>

              <p>Ok, your going down hill. I know how hard it is to get some good things together when you start, but you really just need to listen to what we say. Use 100% prims because your wireframe will be 100% cleaner and thing your design through alot more. I’m not trying to make you made either, i’m giving you a hand by telling you that. Good luck with future models, keep it up. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
