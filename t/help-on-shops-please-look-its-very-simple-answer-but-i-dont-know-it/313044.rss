          <blockquote>
              <p>im pretty sure the prices of items in shops are based on the actual item found in item.cfg</p>
<p>the first three values next to the item id name and description are buy, sell and alch values (not sure the order).</p>
<p>so you would go into your item cfg search the item you want to edit the price of and change one or more of those values, youll have to</p>
<p>find out which ones which with somone else.</p>
