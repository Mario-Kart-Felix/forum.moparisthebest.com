Where to begin with any Introduction, over looking various projects such as XenoRune and Hyperion it seems to me that the introduction is the key to a project thread.

SO lets begin shall we there have been many past projects from me which haven&#39;t really developed into anything recognisable, I hope to change this with Scorpio. Scorpio is a private server using the 474 RuneScape era, this has items such as Godswords and Dragon Boots this was also the time of which some recognise as RuneScape&#39;s Best Days. No Trade Limit, No HD and the Wilderness was still available to player-kill.

Throughout development of Scorpio I will be testing everything I do with people that support the thread so you can get a look and feel for how it works and updates, this because I cannot test my updates fully without the use of the people who will be playing it! There will be mini-beta tests for a select few supporters, I will only pick those who will give the best feedback not those who just want to play. Don&#39;t be put down if you do not get chosen, there are many updates I may need help with and you will be just as important!

As Scorpio is a fairly new project that I have been working on for almost a week I decided to post a project thread and show you what I have done so far and aim to do. As my base was Hyperion I have had to create shops and trading from nothing and I couldn&#39;t use variables from the 508 servers out there for this either as it had changed! There are a lot of undocumented aspects of my work in which I hope to get a better understanding and knowledge of such as synchronization, executor services and loading formats such as a RandomAccessFile and a basic BufferedReader. This project should hopefully give me a greater learning for this.

So far on my list of learning I have learnt about the RandomAccessFile and it&#39;s advantages and disadvantages (Hard to modify without the use of a GUI or some other editing software). I have also learnt about MySQL functionality between client -&gt; server and server -&gt; client. Explored various techniques of using a simple SQL String Query and a StoredProcedure. I have made a forum -&gt; server integration for user registrations, however I do not save their game data in a MySQL Database I use a GZip Compressed file on a local machine. I perform [b]cron[/b] jobs every 30 minutes for a backup on a local machine, every 7 days it deletes the previous weeks day as we don&#39;t want to be storing that much! (Incase of corrupt profile or a glitch exploit)

With my 474 I hope I don&#39;t set big goals in the future but small ones, progressing thoroughly and effectively. With this in mind I should fulfil my achievement of having the most successful 474 to-date. Coded by myself, no team workers just myself. I wont be releasing a BETA until I am comfortable with progress and need a lot of feedback. However for now you may sign up at the forums and follow the guide there to play Scorpio while it is still in development.

Hope to see you soon.
