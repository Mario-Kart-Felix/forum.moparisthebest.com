    <title>Back from the dead again - DIVINITY IN DARKNESS(l3etascape)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/back-from-the-dead-again-divinity-in-darkness-l3etascape/546348</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m back again... for those of you that know already what Divinity In Darkness was to become, or l3etascape was then you already know me as l3etal3lade, I lost my password... for those who don&#39;t, I was one of the original coders of rsps, when rsps came out working with AWSOME PEOPLE SUCH AS:

Phate, Miss. Silabsoft, Xerox, and many more people including shout outs to winterlove for getting me interested in RSPS DEV And JAVA after 8 ish years of not coding servers I am back.


I have recently reboxed my old external hardrive and got it working again I found my old source codes for Divinity in Darkness and l3etascape, also a blank original untouched winterlove source and rsc source among a treasure trove of 233GB/500GB Data worth of servers/ clients for misc games, bots, hacks, things from highschool, pictures, many things it was like a time capsule that you would dig up in a sense.  I have gifts I will be spreading to people possibly in the coming future once I verify the old sources are working and untouched I have a huge amount of files from many games and noes to sort through.

 LONG STORY SHORT = DIVINITY IN DARKNESS WAS A COLLABORATION WITH MANY SERVER OWNERS AND THEIR GATHERING OF PROJECTS OF THAT TIME BEAR THAT IN MIND THIS ENTIRE TIME.

I had a goal of making a server that was much more advanced then, I had/have in place a source code that has magic spells that will work based off of KARMA and that Karma is a player bound stat, the idea was to also map regions and towns and certain areas were a hot spot for good or evil players, npcs, and shop owners would react to you differently  based of choices you made. Which means choices were made in quests based of the morality of who you wanted to build into you characters file.

I had made the server loop to read files so I could add quest dialogue and edit parts of the server without restarting also so this too I will be working on. 

I believe if Miss. Silab and I had continued down the path we were going on coding together without servers possibly if Divinity In Darkness or as some had known it as Project Zero , may have been one of the top rated servers still running but I had issues in life and now am an adult and interested in coding again looking for a team of coder who we can all teach a little bit too each other, I have a base model already I as planning to use as a redev for my plan. I WANT A SERVER THAT EMULATES A REAL WORLD ALSO, RS HAS ALL THE ABILITY TO DO SO, MY, servers also progressed in time of day to night fall, and also I was offering seasonal value with the snow sometimes, so I wan&#39;t to create a realer vibe to a game. Are any Devs up to the challenege of this proposal? I want to make a server with changing weather globally in different areas like the world (EX: Varrock maybe has snow but ardy is beautiful) those random things I  am a developer that like to add random bits of mystique... 

Things I add as a dev are to deepen the game usually. Emotionally and drawn the user in. I want to Make a RSPS have real life events, and karmic records basically i have the source codes of servers that already have it implemented from years ago but I&#39;d like to get help translating my work into the newer server sources.

THIS HAS HUGE GROWTH POTENTIAL. PLEASE HELP ME START THE NEXT BEST SERVER DEV TEAM.</description>
