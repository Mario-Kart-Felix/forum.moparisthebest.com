    <description>I recently was in the military doing a logistics role in the navy however i injured myself and cannot go back for 1 year, Currently i am thinking about studying a Diploma of Information technology Networking because i wish to transfer to a more I.T role like a Communication Information Systems (CIS). However the study is not needed to transfer I am just really bored doing nothing for a year and would like to hear peoples opinions on this course if it would be worth it, or what they think of that kind of study?</description>

              <p>If you got nothing to do then it’s always better to do something.<br>
And yeah the course itself is worth it especially if you don’t know anything about networking.<br>
So what I imagine it’s going to be about based on what I’ve learned:</p>
<p>[ul][li]DHCP, DNS[/li]<br>
[li]Network schemes[/li]<br>
[li]Cisco routers, packet tracer[/li][/ul]</p>
