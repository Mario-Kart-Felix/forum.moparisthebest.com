    <title>Need Somebody to Setup my CacheDownloader</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-somebody-to-setup-my-cachedownloader/412841</link>
    <description>I have my cache in Dropbox.. I can pay RSGP to whomever sets my cachedownloader up (I have the cache in dropbox). ALSO, you may have to ReJar it for me just because when I try to JAR the client folder, I get &quot;Cannot find main class: client&quot;...

Idk other people can JAR it but not me.

I&#39;ll pay RSGP.. I know it&#39;s an easy to-do but I need it done and I cannot jar, so it&#39;s simpler for me to have you setup cachedownloader and stuff too..

Add me on MSN for help: dawgs007@hotmail.com

THANKS!</description>
