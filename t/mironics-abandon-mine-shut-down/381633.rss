    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mironics-abandon-mine-shut-down/381633</link>
    <description>[s]i opened a mine, for the new people,you may dig when you see a sign that says &quot;you may did beyond this point&quot;

we are nere Lumbridge just look for this statue of dirt outside
[img]http://img820.imageshack.us/img820/127/symbolq.png[/img]


Block A: a very long passage that leads straight from the entrance of the mine to the digging cave
Safe

Block B: there is a block B entrance on the surface, but you will have to find it yourself, otherwise use to door in block A that leads to block B, Block B leads to an abandon Gold cave, had a dungeon in it but i destroyed it still monsters lurk in it sometimes
 Cautious

V.i.P Block: This block is locked off to people who are not apart of the Mironics mine staff
this Block features a room. wiith a few tables... mainly a meeting room.
DANGEROUS If your caught in the ViP room and your nto a vip you will be killed.

Thanks. have a nice day and bring your own tools ;:3
