    <title>Windows Re-Installing Problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/windows-re-installing-problems/33212</link>
    <description>Hey,

     I was re-installing my windows from directions from [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,31099.0.html]here[/url] and I downloaded, and burned the ISO onto a blank disc. But there is one problem, no matter how many times that I change the boot settings in my BIOS, it ALWAYS boots to my hard drive. I have tried both of my CD drives, so I know it&#39;s not that. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s doing it now though. I have re-installed my windows many times before, and then haven&#39;t for about 8 months. The only thing that I might think would be my problem is the fact that I installed the stupid boot screen because I got sick of seeing the Windows XP logo everytime I turned my computer on. But, like I said, I&#39;m not sure if it is this. I already checked to see if the ISO was bootable (Magic ISO) and it is. Has anyone ever had this problem, and if they had, or haven&#39;t, do they know how to fix it.

              <p>I did, and I think I found the problem. I haven’t re-installed Windows XP Pro in about 8 months now, and last time I did it, it was from a neighbors CD. I’m burning the CD right now, so I don’t know if it works, but I extracted the ISO this time using WINRAR. So, I’ll post my results and tell you if that worked.</p>

              <p>Hmm… that is a strange problem. The new bootscreen should have nothing to do with it, unless you changed the bootscreen of the BIOS (in that case, it might be a BIOS flashing screw-up), but I doubt that that is the problem.</p>
<p>I have a feeling you didn’t set the boot order up correctly <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> And make sure you choose ‘<span class="bbcode-b">Save</span> &amp; Exit’ whenever you exit the BIOS settings <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
