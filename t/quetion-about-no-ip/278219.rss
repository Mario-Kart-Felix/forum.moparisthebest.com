    <title>Quetion about No-IP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quetion-about-no-ip/278219</link>
    <description>My server wont start with No-IP and I don&#39;t know why, I made an account with the DNS Host (A) and I started it and it has the smiley face on the downloaded version as if it is connected and I also edited my client and put in the right address but it still wont connect. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m doing something wrong.</description>
