    <title>Fun with Sorting Algorithms</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fun-with-sorting-algorithms/227198</link>
    <description>I find Algorithms kind of fun. I have here a list of some Sorting Algorithms, Their Description, and their implementation.

Basically, a while ago, I was assigned these to work on. I was told how each algorithm works, its design, but I was given no code or pseudo code. And this is what I came up with. If there is anything wrong w/ my implementation, please tell me so I can fix.


[b]Program.java[/b]

[code]import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Program
{
      public static void main(String args[])
      {
         Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
         ISorter sort =  new MergeSort();
         Random rand = new Random();
    
    
         int[] array = new int[1000000];
         
         for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++)
         {
            array[i] = rand.nextInt(100000);
         }
         
         System.out.println(&quot;Press Enter to Sort 1,000,000 ints with MergeSort!&quot;);
         input.nextLine();

         System.out.println(&quot;Sorting... Please wait...&quot;);

         array = sort.Sort(array);
         
	 System.out.println();

         if(isSorted(array))
            System.out.println(&quot;The Array is Sorted!&quot;);
         else
            System.out.println(&quot;The Array is NOT Sorted!&quot;);

	System.out.println();
         
         
      }

   static boolean
   isSorted(int[] array)
   {

      for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.length - 1; i++)
      {
         if (array[i] &gt; array[i + 1])
            return false;
      }

      return true;
   }
}[/code]

[b]ISorter.java[/b]

[code] interface ISorter
{
	int[] Sort(int array[]);
}[/code]



[size=17pt][b]Bubble Sort[/b][/size]

[b]Description: [/b] Bubble Sort is a very simple Algorithm, It basically searches through a list until it finds something out of place, It then swaps it with the next in line. And it continues to do so, until a loop through the list is completed without a swap. This runs well when a list is Nearly sorted. But worst when a list is Random. Its worst-case is O(n^2).

[b]BubbleSort.java[/b]

[code]
public class BubbleSort implements ISorter
{
	public int[]
	Sort (int[] array)
	{
      boolean sorted = false;

      while (!sorted)
      {
         sorted = true;

         for(int i = 0; i &lt; array.length -1; i++)
         {
            if(array[i] &gt; array[i+1])
            {
               int temp = array[i+1];
               array[i+1] = array[i];
               array[i] = temp;

               sorted = false;
            }
         }
      }

      return array;
	}
}[/code]

[size=17pt][b]Insertion Sort[/b][/size]

[b]Description: [/b] Insertion Sort Iterates through a list, and removes an element from that list, then puts it into an already sorted list. Its worst case is O(n^2).


[b]InsertionSort.java[/b]

[code] public class InsertionSort implements ISorter
{
   public int[]
   Sort(int[] array)
   {
      int select = 0;
      int temp = 0;

      for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++)
      {
         for (select = 0; select &lt; i &amp;&amp; array[i] &gt; array[select]; select++);
         
         temp = array[i];
         for(int s = i; s &gt; select; s--)
         {
            array[s] = array[s-1];
         }
         array[select] = temp;
      }
      return array;
   }
}[/code]


[size=17pt][b]Selection Sort[/b][/size]

[b]Description: [/b] Selection Sort Iterates through a list, and finds the smallest value, It then swaps the smallest value with the starting position. It also uses the idea of Partitioning. Its worst case is O(n^2).


[b]SelectionSort.java[/b]

[code] public class SelectionSort implements ISorter
{
   
   public int[]
   Sort(int[] array)
   {
      int select = 0;
      int temp = 0;
      
      for(int i = 0; i &lt; array.length-1; i++)
      {
         select = i;
         for(int c = i+1; c &lt; array.length; c++)
         {
            if(array[select] &gt; array[c])
               select = c;
         }
         temp = array[select];
         array[select] = array[i];
         array[i] = temp;
      }
      return array;
   }
   
} [/code]


[size=17pt][b]Quick Sort[/b][/size]

[b]Description: [/b] Quick Sort picks some value in a list, and uses it as a pivot. It then re-organizes the list so that anything less than that pivot is on the left, anything larger than it is on the right. It then Recursively calls Itself until the list is sorted. Its worst case is O(n^2), but on average its  O([i]n[/i]log[i]n[/i]). Results vary depending on the Pivot chosen, and how you chose the pivot.


[b]QuickSort.java[/b]

[code] public class QuickSort implements ISorter
{
   public int[]
   Sort (int[] array)
   {
      return QuickSorter(array, 0, array.length-1);
   }
   
   private int[]
   QuickSorter (int[] array, int low, int high)
   {
      if(high &lt;= low)
         return array;
         
        
      int rHigh = high;
      int pivit = high;
      high = high-1;
      int temp = 0;
      int rLow = low;
      
      while(low &lt;= high)
      {
      
         while (low &lt; rHigh &amp;&amp; array[low] &lt;= array[pivit])
            low++;
            
         while (high &gt;= rLow &amp;&amp; array[high] &gt; array[pivit])
            high--;
         
         if(low &lt; high)
         {
            temp = array[high];
            array[high] = array[low];
            array[low] = temp;
         }
      }
      temp = array[pivit];
      array[pivit] = array[low];
      array[low] = temp;
      pivit = low;
      QuickSorter(array, rLow, pivit-1);
      QuickSorter(array, pivit+1, rHigh);
      return array;
   }
}[/code]


[size=17pt][b]Merge Sort[/b][/size]

[b]Description: [/b] Merge Sort, this is my favorite sorting algorithm. It goes like so, Check if list length is 1, if so, its sorted. If its not, then divide the list into 2 lists, Then recursively call Merge Sort from there on each list. After that, actually MERGE the lists together. Its worst case is O([i]n[/i]log[i]n[/i]).


[b]MergeSort.java[/b]

[code] public class MergeSort implements ISorter
{
   public int[]
   Sort (int[] array)
   {
      return MergeSorter(array);
   }
   
   private int[]
   MergeSorter (int[] array)
   {
      if(array.length == 1)
         return array;
      
      int[] left = new int[array.length / 2];
      
      for(int i = 0; i &lt; (array.length / 2); i++)
         left[i] = array[i];
      
      int[] right = new int[array.length - left.length];
         
      int it = 0;
      for(int i = (array.length / 2); i &lt; array.length; i++)
         right[it++] = array[i];
      
      array = Merge(MergeSorter(left), MergeSorter(right));
      
      return array;
      
   }
   
   public int[]
   Merge (int[] left, int[] right)
   {
      int len = left.length + right.length;
      int[] toReturn = new int[len];
      int leftIter = 0;
      int rightIter = 0;
      
      for(int i = 0; i &lt; toReturn.length; i++)
      {
         if(leftIter &lt; left.length &amp;&amp; rightIter &lt; right.length)
         {
            if(left[leftIter] &lt; right[rightIter])
               toReturn[i] = left[leftIter++];
            else
               toReturn[i] = right[rightIter++];
         }
         else if(leftIter &lt; left.length)
         {
            toReturn[i] = left[leftIter++];
         }
         else
         {
            toReturn[i] = right[rightIter++];
         }
      }
      return toReturn;
   }
}[/code]</description>

FAIL. -Xprof profiles the application, breaking that output into native and interpreted code. JIT is enabled at all times (unless you specify a special option on the command line.
<blockquote>Last I remembered, Java's closest option was JNI (Java Native Interface).  However, if this is not the case anymore, my apologies.</blockquote>
WTF has JNI got to do with this? If I wanted to write shit in c++ and other bits in java I would have to deal with the shit associated with compiling directly into native. I would just write a normal c++ program and to hell with java. Enjoy compiling multiple versions for multiple platforms and that other native crap. JNI is an INTERFACE. It doesn't do anything to your code except provide a way for java and native to talk to each other.

Which means that Java DOES have the ability to JIT, but it is not completely available in the standered JVM, and even this profiler is not always available.

FAIL again. Some code is better at being interpreted. Some code better after it has passed through the JIT compiler. Why the hell would you force all code to be JIT compiled if the computer can optimize only the parts that are necessary and incur a performance hit with each compilation? There are a few articles that explain it in more detail so you get a second shot at this:

<p>Last I remembered, Java’s closest option was JNI (Java Native Interface).  However, if this is not the case anymore, my apologies.</p>
<p>Actually, I did some googleing before pressing the “Post” button, and found this.</p>
<p>Apparently, -Xprof only nativly compiles “hotspots” in the code, which are spots that the JVM takes a longer time to process.</p>
<p>I also found this:</p>
<blockquote>So is -Xprof useful? Yes, after all you are getting some profiling information for almost nothing. But it isn't a sufficient profiler to performance tune on it's own, except for very simple applications. And, of course, you only get output from -Xprof when the JVM includes HotSpot, which is not the case for all JVMs.</blockquote>
<p>Where as a JIT compiler is somethign more along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>In a bytecode-compiled system, source code is translated to an intermediate representation known as bytecode. Bytecode is not the machine code for any particular computer, and may be portable among computer architectures. The bytecode may then be interpreted, or run, on a virtual machine. A just-in-time compiler can be used as a way to speed up execution of bytecode. At the time the bytecode is run, the just-in-time compiler will compile some or all of it to native machine code for better performance. This can be done per-file, per-function or even on any arbitrary code fragment; the code can be compiled when it is about to be executed (hence the name "just-in-time").</blockquote>
<p>And upon even more investigation,</p>
<blockquote>One possible optimization, used by Sun's HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, is to combine interpretation and JIT compilation. The application code is initially interpreted, but the JVM monitors which sequences of bytecode are frequently executed and translates them to machine code for direct execution on the hardware.</blockquote>
<p>So, the “HotSpot” profiler, (-Xprof) is just a combination of JIT compiling and interpreting.  Which means that Java DOES have the ability to JIT, but it is not completely available in the standered JVM, and even this profiler is not always available.  However, having said that, I was able to find some third-party JIT compiler for Java online.</p>

Most often, this consists of source code or more commonly bytecode translation to machine code, which is then executed directly. A system implementing a JIT compiler typically continuously analyses the code being executed and identifies parts of the code whe JIT c...</p>

<p>I think people need to be encouraged to learn as many languages as possible, as they all have their advantages and disadvantages (except for a few that just plain suck).</p>

I love the idea of having a multi-platform language, and I think Java has done an excellent Job about it. But Java is not an ideal language for commercial applications, It tends to run slower, and the source code is not as secure.</p>
<p>About 91% of personal computers use Windows, about 5% use Mac, and about 2% use Linux, with 2% other (solaris, ect.).</p>
<p>Now C# will work fast and reliably on 91% of the personal computers. That’s 91%, that is a large majority. It will also run on Linux and Mac using Mono. So it <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> work on 98% of the personal computers. What would you want as a regular consumer, who knows nothing about computers? A program that runs on your computer, or any other computer, but runs slow. Or would you like a program that is really fast, and runs well on your computer, and on 91% of your friends computers?</p>
<p>You also cannot argue that the C# syntax is ‘so simple a child could understand it’, If you have looked at the C# syntax it is EXACTLY (with a few exceptions) like Java’s. Obviously some very intelligent Pro-Open source programmers like the C# language, otherwise Mono wouldn’t exist.</p>

<p>I have not implemented them myself yet, but I have checked the wiki’s on them…</p>
<p>I very well could be wrong, but Heap Sort puts a list of values into a binary tree, and then calls getMinimum, or getMaximum, and inserts it into a new list, until the tree is empty…</p>
<p>And bucket sort, from what i can gather, uses divide and conquer. It seems to have the same idea as merge sort, but is not done recursively.</p>

<p>
 In computer science, heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like that algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. The improvement consists of the use of a heap data structure rather than a linear-time search to find the maximum.

              <p>I find Algorithms kind of fun. I have here a list of some Sorting Algorithms, Their Description, and their implementation.</p>
<p>Basically, a while ago, I was assigned these to work on. I was told how each algorithm works, its design, but I was given no code or pseudo code. And this is what I came up with. If there is anything wrong w/ my implementation, please tell me so I can fix.</p>

     System.out.println("Press Enter to Sort 1,000,000 ints with MergeSort!");
     input.nextLine();

     System.out.println("Sorting... Please wait...");

And it continues to do so, until a loop through the list is completed without a swap. This runs well when a list is Nearly sorted. But worst when a list is Random. Its worst-case is O(n^2).</p>
