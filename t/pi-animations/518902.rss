    <description>So all of a sudden, my lesser demons look like they are tripping balls.. They are like jumping in the air, doing weird shit with their body&#39;s, Rune c&#39;bow does some weird animation, not like the normal one.. Godswords changed also, they do some weird shit when you walk with them, and the spec is different also. All of this was normal before, and i can&#39;t really find what the problem is.. I&#39;m not getting any errors in Eclipse also..
Any idea&#39;s? Help would be much appreciated!

EDIT: Found the problem, thread can be deleted.</description>
