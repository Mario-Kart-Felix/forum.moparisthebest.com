    <description>Hey guys i dont have Photoshop and im not very good at gfx what so ever so i was wondering if i could get one of you guys to make 1 for me

im looking for a banner which has the title &quot;Universal Gamers&quot; in centerish maybe with a little angle to make it stylish and a gaming sort of backround like pictures of games such as gunz maplestory and other popular games and possibly a 3D&#39;ish effect to the title? 

pixels Width 796 X Height 93
