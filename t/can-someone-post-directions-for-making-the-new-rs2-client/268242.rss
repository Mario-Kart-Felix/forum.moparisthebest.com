    <description>If someone could post a link or directions on how to make the Runescape 2 client, because the client I am trying to make right now is like really old... It was posted like a year ago. So I was wondering if someone could post (Directions or Link) on how to make the runescape 2 client. If you could help me I would thank you very much might try to give up an (rep).
