    <title>Tile Engine</title>

    <description>Hey, i&#39;ve started a tile engine in VB .Net(not the most suited language but that&#39;s what i&#39;ve written it in). It is going well, It can load in Terrain, Objects, Characters and Items packages and draws with a layered system, ie draws the terrain, then the sub layer objects, then the collision layer objects and characters. It has basic(incomplete) tile blending that blends terrain from one to another, making a smooth transition between the two, and it has basic interactivity, as in objects can be used, such as ladders to take you to another location on the map. However, the way it draws the map is it figures out which tiles are currently in view on the client. It then goes through each tile and draws the terrain, and then through each tile again and draws the sub layer, and then goes through all the tiles AGAIN and draws the collision layer. This is performed using a For Loop. There must be a better way of doing this as when it is showing 1000 tiles(each 25px by 25px) it draws very slowly at 8 FPS. How else could I do this.</description>

Besides, judging from this person’s experience, he would find it hard to do it the original way.</p>

              <p>Super_, You obviously have no alternate method and instead spend your time trolling. Guru my arse. Now whos bad? You lmao. and Lin, currently im using the System.Drawing.Graphics Class provided with the framework, and using the default DrawImage method in a For loop for each tile. I didn’t think there would be any need for alternatives before i started the project otherwise I would have used DirectX, and created some sort of virtual cache that stored parts of the map. I have searched up on the DMA and had a look for the fastpixel class you mentioned and couldn’t find much, although am I right in syaing that the fastpixel is LockBits?</p>

<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>: Look into DMA (Direct Memory Access). There’s sources online to make it easier for you, such as the FastPixel class, which just requires a method call and from there you can use its SetPixel method. You should get some huge speed boosts when done.</p>
