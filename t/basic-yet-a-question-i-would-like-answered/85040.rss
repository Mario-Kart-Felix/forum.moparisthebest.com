    <title>Basic yet a question I would like answered!</title>

    <description>Hello,

I was just wondering if there was a way to create a peice of land, or maybe there is just a peice of land, on the server base that you could just create from scratch, and the only way to get to it would be a command or something. I would like to know this very much because I would like to make a moderators island/city or something out of this. I have seen it done (I think in my first time experiences with servers).</description>
