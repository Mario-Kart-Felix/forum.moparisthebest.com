    <description>Hello Everybody and Welcome to the forum post of RazenClaw v2

First off, i&#39;ll start by saying that i did have an EPIC fail of a server back in Feb. that got about a constant 30 plays and a decent ammount of donations. Reason i shut it down is due to technically matters. BUT that was when i was just a fail coder. But ive learned a lot since then and ive decided to make RCv2.

-If you want to better keep track of my &quot;improvement&quot; id advise you go here... [URL=http://&quot;http://www.toodledo.com/views/public.php?id=td4cbf8eb7a7dd4&quot;]http://www.toodledo.com/views/public.php?id=td4cbf8eb7a7dd4[/URL]

-Im still not a PRO coder but im a pretty good one, but since im not PRO i need some help with things. I&#39;ll take some people (max of 5) to help me with the server. If you want to join just fill out an app:
