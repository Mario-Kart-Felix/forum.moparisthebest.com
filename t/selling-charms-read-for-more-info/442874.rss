    <title>Selling Charms (Read for more info)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/selling-charms-read-for-more-info/442874</link>
    <description>       For anybody who wants to get some charms for summoning with minimal effort, I&#39;ll be selling charms at Rock Lobsters. If you don&#39;t get how you can sell charms, you simply lootshare them and buy them later. I will be charging the costs of supplies (prayer potions + runes) with an additional 500gp per crimson and 1000gp per blue charm. For a comparison of prices, most people sell crimsons at 10-15k and blues at 20-25k. Why am I giving you guys such a good deal? Well, I figured I&#39;d make a Moparscape exclusive ;) Rune costs shouldn&#39;t get too high considering I&#39;m using a Staff of Light and Battle Robes (my rune usage is essentially cut by 2/3).

      If you are interested, please PM me [b]both ingame and on here![/b] My ingame name is [b]Eq[u][i]v[/i][/u]ilibrate[/b] (underlined the v to avoid confusion). I want PMs on here to both verify that you are in fact a member of Moparscape and to make a list of who wants charms. First come, first serve.

      If you don&#39;t know how to get to Rock lobsters or simply want me to bring you there, I&#39;ll charge another 3000gp. You will also need to bring a ranged weapon yourself, as I only plan to bring a blisterwood stake as mine.

      Aside from that, you&#39;re all set! I&#39;ll give you further details ingame when its your turn :) I will also try to update this thread for when I&#39;m available to sell charms. I will not be available for most of the day (due to school, track, sleep or dinner usually), but when I am available, I&#39;ll do my best to keep this up to date.

[u][b][size=10pt]PAYMENT:[/size][/b][/u]
Just to clarify how payment for this works:
-When paying for casts, you will simply pay in Death Runes or coins. You will pay me enough death runes to cover my usage or coins equal to the death rune&#39;s cost.
-When paying for charms, please pay AFTER you think you&#39;ve gotten enough. I will be keeping track of charm drops though, so don&#39;t lie about them (especially when they are less than 1/20 of the usual price). You will pay for them THERE. There is a reason for the safe spot :P

[b][size=18pt]I am currently [u]AVAILABLE[/u][/size][/b]. Please PM me HERE so I can set up.</description>

              <pre><code>   For anybody who wants to get some charms for summoning with minimal effort, I'll be selling charms at Rock Lobsters. If you don't get how you can sell charms, you simply lootshare them and buy them later. I will be charging the costs of supplies (prayer potions + runes) with an additional 500gp per crimson and 1000gp per blue charm. For a comparison of prices, most people sell crimsons at 10-15k and blues at 20-25k. Why am I giving you guys such a good deal? Well, I figured I'd make a Moparscape exclusive ;) Rune costs shouldn't get too high considering I'm using a Staff of Light and Battle Robes (my rune usage is essentially cut by 2/3).

  If you are interested, please PM me [b]both ingame and on here![/b] My ingame name is [b]Eq[u][i]v[/i][/u]ilibrate[/b] (underlined the v to avoid confusion). I want PMs on here to both verify that you are in fact a member of Moparscape and to make a list of who wants charms. First come, first serve.

  If you don't know how to get to Rock lobsters or simply want me to bring you there, I'll charge another 3000gp. You will also need to bring a ranged weapon yourself, as I only plan to bring a blisterwood stake as mine.

  Aside from that, you're all set! I'll give you further details ingame when its your turn :) I will also try to update this thread for when I'm available to sell charms. I will not be available for most of the day (due to school, track, sleep or dinner usually), but when I am available, I'll do my best to keep this up to date.
</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">[size=10pt]PAYMENT:[/size]</span></span><br>
Just to clarify how payment for this works:<br>
-When paying for casts, you will simply pay in Death Runes or coins. You will pay me enough death runes to cover my usage or coins equal to the death rune’s cost.<br>
-When paying for charms, please pay AFTER you think you’ve gotten enough. I will be keeping track of charm drops though, so don’t lie about them (especially when they are less than 1/20 of the usual price). You will pay for them THERE. There is a reason for the safe spot <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=18pt]I am currently <span class="bbcode-u">AVAILABLE</span>[/size]</span>. Please PM me HERE so I can set up.</p>
