              <p>I seriously wouldn’t recommend that because of what I put in there. I think everything I made had a few bugs, but I wasn’t that good with java at all. I’m pretty decent now.</p>

              <p>[quote=“wildskiller, post:2, topic:538545”]I use 637. The code inside my source is like 99% mine because I have completely removed everything but networking and have been putting some work into it for a week and a half.</p>
<p>My player loading and saving uses a DataStream. My interfaces are handled by an interface state superclass. My container is more efficient and supports multiple types. I’ve written degrading and is loaded by XML. My spells are loaded from a folder. My combat is pretty much perfect. I still have to write every skill, minigame, and monster. It’s pretty much a remake in another person’s perspective. You shouldn’t judge the code if you can’t re-write it.[/quote]<br>

              <p>I doubt it’s because of ‘poor code’ otherwise nobody would be using matrix, pi, delta, winterlove etc <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>It’s more down to what version people like to play. I personally love 508 and 530’s but that’s just me.</p>
