    <title>How to write name onto a file?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-write-name-onto-a-file/289325</link>
    <description>I am creating 2 directories called &quot;onBan&quot; and &quot;onMute&quot;, where the players will be temporarily placed until they are unban or unmuted. How do I code this so that it moves the players from the main directory (where all characters are originally located)? I also want to know is how to transfer names onto a list while server is still running, this way i don&#39;t have to restart server repeatedly.

I Need to figure out how to move a characters file to the onBan &amp; onMute directory.</description>

              <p>So then a variable in the player’s file is a better choice, and when they are banned/muted, set that variable to the time of the ban/mute, and make it so three days (assumption) later, that variable equals 0, in which case it is also false.</p>

<p>No, I am making it so that the ban/mute exceeds for a certain amount of time until player is unbanned/unmuted like in the Runescape game. This way I do not have to remember when to unban a player.</p>

              <ol>
<li>Trying to “move” the character files to a whole new directory is too much work that you don’t want to have to deal with. It would have to involve loading all the characters from the main directory, and the onBan, AND the onMute. An easier way would be to just create a field in the character files that says either isBanned or isMuted</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">player-isBanned: false;
player-isMuted: true;</code></pre>
<p>And for the list, it all depends on what you want to transfer. Do you want to transfer Banned users, muted users, or all players?</p>
