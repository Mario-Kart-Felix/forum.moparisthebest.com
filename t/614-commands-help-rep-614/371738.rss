    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/614-commands-help-rep-614/371738</link>
    <description>Well it seems my commands can only be used by admins and I&#39;m not sure why? I can only use a very few commands as a normal player such as item, home, and bank...

Anyone who can figure out how I can make it so all Players can use all commands I will rep++
Here is my Packets.java and my CommandHandler.java: [URL=http://&quot;http://www.mediafire.com/?gfr6699garw56x7&quot;]HERE[/URL]</description>

Your using a empty based source. Users posted them at the downloads section. No one on here is that good at coding. Most people concentrate on 317’s but the best you can get is 562 coders.</p>
