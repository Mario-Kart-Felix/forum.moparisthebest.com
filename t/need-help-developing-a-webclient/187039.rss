    <description>[center][size=32pt]NEED HELP DEVELOPING!!![/size][/center]

[center]Alright, I have an smfforfree website (not posting url because of advertising) and I have my own client for it. How do I make it into a webclient for the site? I&#39;m specifically looking for someone to help me make it. My server is Crank That Scape and we are very successful, and would be even better if we had one. Helpers will be rewarded on my server greatly! For more info such as website address and server ip, message me. Thanks![/center]
