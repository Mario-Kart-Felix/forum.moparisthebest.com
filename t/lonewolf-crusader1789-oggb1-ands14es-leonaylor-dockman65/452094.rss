    <description>Another round of fun. Some of these I have already fixed the damage for since it was not that much, would just like to have it noted that they have griefed before regardless.

ands14es just happened to be lucky enough to dig straight down into my mine right next to a zombie spawner. Sounds legit? (fuscate knows location, just posting to have a record of it)

This has already been solved, but I believe someone else also had some problems with this leonaylor guy.

oggb1 took my wheat and didn&#39;t even replant, He also stole some of my lily pads. He also helped himself to my sugar cane
[img]http://aar.im/i/20120-bc.png[/img]
This was from a while ago, just really to show that he has taken random blocks from me in the past. Can&#39;t find the other one of him I had though

Got him another bed and some nice glowstone =/

The above two are not really much damage, but it just keeps adding on to the other annoyance this guy is causing. From what I read in the new rules, harvesting crops is against the rules, so yeah. That&#39;s the reason behind that one.

This crusader guy decided to break in or out of my chest room (Not sure which) and let water in from a nearby lake


*edit* got griefed more while waiting for this to clear by dockman65 lol
