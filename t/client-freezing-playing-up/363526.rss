    <title>Client freezing, playing up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-freezing-playing-up/363526</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;ve never really had any problems with clients before so I&#39;ll try and explain this as well as possible. Basically, people have been freezing in all areas (somewhat randomly) and some even disconnecting. I believe the client is based of Boxingscape which I believe to be Bluur. 

I personally don&#39;t experience such crashes but others do. They say there is no error in the cmd. This makes it harder to locate.

Any help/information is widely accepted and thanked.

Thanks in advance.</description>
