    <description>I&#39;ve read [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=449295.0]This[/url] over and over, I still can&#39;t seem to get the Cache right. I don&#39;t know how to do the Cache. All I need is getting the Cache right and the jar &amp; cache downloadable. I don&#39;t know how to get the download link from dropbox, or even get the Cache right. Can you please help me, I&#39;ll repp ++.

Can you take a look at my cache.zip please:

I&#39;ve jarred my client now I&#39;m getting the &quot;Connection Error - Retrying in 5&quot;. Help please.
