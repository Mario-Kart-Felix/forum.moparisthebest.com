Another for support on that one, as mods can do it at-will, and will require nobody new to do the job. Also, would be less complaining, as there would be a board specifically made for decent tuts.</p>

Actually it was here, before MITB decided to switch and upgrade to SMF2.0. The mod was not available for SMF2.0 at the time, (might be now, idk), but after soo long of being without it, why decide to put it back? Sure, it would be nice for the people who actually look in there, but mods have enough work on their hands. Unless we promoted like 2 mods that live in different countries to do JUST tutorial approving, it wouldn’t be worth it. Lets just drop the topic, as this has been suggested many times, and never goes anywhere.</p>
