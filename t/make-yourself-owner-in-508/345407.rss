    <title>Make yourself owner in 508?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-yourself-owner-in-508/345407</link>
    <description>Umm, i took a long break from java and RSPS and by long i mean years. I forgot most things in knew before, anyway, how do i make myself the owner in a 508 and how to i get item id&#39;s to spawn things i want etc :) also, in 317&#39;s you can edit your stuff in your characters folder and what not, is there anything like that for a 508 where you can edit your character quick and simple? or...anyway at all?</description>
