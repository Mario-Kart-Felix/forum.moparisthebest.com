    <title>Evil Cowgod - writing Black Book 7</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/evil-cowgod-writing-black-book-7/109989</link>
    <description>Hi,

I&#39;m Evil Cowgod. For those who don&#39;t know, I ran the main cheating forums around 2001-2003. I&#39;ve always encouraged people to not trust anyone claiming to be me (although I doubt anyone would bother impersonating me now days), but we can fully prove my identity later. For now, just read the news flasher thingo from my original forum (the one where AutoRune was born): http://evilcowgod.conforums.com/ . I&#39;ll buzz Dylock and Kaitnieks when they come on MSN, but I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;ve kept any links to the community either.

I&#39;m here looking for someone who&#39;s willing to pick up the Black Book where I left off. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to find someone who&#39;s both keen to write, and whose word is respected by the community. I know nothing about what&#39;s happened since around the time Kaitnieks.com has died, and I&#39;m not interested in a full return to cheating.

Right now, there&#39;s a partly written version 7, written back in the days of Kaitnieks.com. Those cheating historians amongst you may be asking &quot;what about version 6?&quot;. A version 6 was actually officially released, but it sucked so much I recalled it. The contents of version 6 would presumably be released with version 7.

This thread isn&#39;t for recruitment (that&#39;ll come later), but more to see if people are interested.

Post your thoughts.</description>

<p>the black book is a good read, despite the fact that i habitually lose it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>Welcome back Cow, it is always great to have an old member return to the community.  A new black book of cheating would be great, and I believe we have plenty of talent here to assist you.  As for me, I have a good memory of most everything that has happened, but I am not a writer by any stretch of the word.  If anyone writing for the book needs some more details on specific things feel free to get ahold of me.</p>
<p>Cow, it would be great to see you on the IRC channel, <a href="http://irc.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">irc.moparisthebest.com</a> <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span></p>

<p>Yeah, I PMed you on Kaitnieks and asked your permission first. Anyway, I’m sorry I couldn’t make it up to standards, nobody else was stepping up and at that point you/everyone else was leaving the community, I felt I had to try. Anyway, good to see you back. Good luck!</p>

<p>I agree with I think it was BeBe, in that contributions should come from several people and then a final editor puts it all together in sequence. A sort of first version can be released and if anythings missing people can step forward to fill in the gaps. Certainly the last couple of years has had it’s many ups and downs so it would make a very interesting read!</p>

Lies, I’m Evil Cowgod. Tbh PSB or Semaphore would make perfect candidates. They can spell + know heaps about cheating lately.<br>
