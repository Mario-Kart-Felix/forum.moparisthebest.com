    <title>Portforwarding problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-problem/370386</link>
    <description>so all this time, my ports were forwarded, but today, all of the sudden, it stopped working! :o! so i decided to check my linksys wtrg45 router, and the ports were forwarded, and the checkbox was enabled! nothing had been touched on it since i first portforwarded it a few months ago, i went to the site canyouseeme.org, it said my port was closed, i tried 5555 too, it said it was closed too, so i checked my router firewall, everything was normal, what is wrong?
if it helps:
it says &quot;connection timed out&quot; on canyouseeme.org</description>
