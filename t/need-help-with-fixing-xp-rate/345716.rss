    <title>Need help with fixing xp rate</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-fixing-xp-rate/345716</link>
    <description>hey guys,

well just to let you all know, I have been working on a server for almost 6 months off and on. I am actually pretty close to
a complete finish i just need one last finishing touch. Which is really pissing me off to be honest. 

How the hell do i fix the exp rate? I am using a easyrsc base at the moment, when i change it on the control panel, the skills still are either really high or really low exp rate wise. And! they exp rate for each skill is different, and when you enter the wilderness the exp rate almost doubles or triples. Anyone know a fix for that?

and I am interested in if anyone could help me with a members/free wild command. i got one coded for whole game at the moment, but I am more so interested in just having in set for the wild.

Thanks guys, i appreciate the help.</description>

              <p>player class file, where it defines xp for skills. should be at the end search for exp.  tweak it by using " / * - + " keys.(You should know what the keys do:) )</p>
<p>If you have one wildy switch thats works properly, you can always tweak/modifi it to only change the gamestyle of wilderness, by using player.getLocation().inWilderness(). You will have to define that in whieldablehandler and itemactioan and all that.</p>
<p>Btw I would laugh my ass off if you worked on a server for 6 whole month and when you lanch it will totally fail. just a fun thought , im not saying it will.</p>
