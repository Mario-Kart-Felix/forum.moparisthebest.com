        <p>I want this game to have the features of multiple popular games, such as RuneScape, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, MineCraft, Mortal Combat, Inotia, and so onâ€¦ The player would be able to play every one of these games as a whole and enjoy it. The idea is to keep it single player with an option to host the current work you have.</p>

<p>[ul][li]Hunger will be the same as MineCraft: giving fishing and cooking a good role. Player interaction will make the character hungrier.[/li]<br>
[li]Building will be like MineCraft: giving construction a good role. Terrain can be generated randomly.[/li]<br>
[li]Farming could be used to plant and harvest berries and herbs for potions to heal pokemon.[/li]<br>
[li]Herblore would be used to make the potions.[/li]<br>
[li]Smithing would be used to make armour for your pokemon[/li]<br>
[li]Crafting could be used to make potion vials or poke balls[/li]<br>
[li]Combat stats would be used for pokemon moves like PP, Power, Accuracy, etc[/li]<br>
[li]Combat could be similar to mortal combat of 2012, where you would face opponents on a platform, and your moves would have mnemonics to them. The combat could be like Inotia, MineCraft, or even RuneScape.[/li]<br>
[li]Collecting cards similar to Yu-Gi-Oh cards could be obtained to apply abilities to your pokemon. They could be replacements for TM/HMs[/li]<br>
[li]Duels similar to how Yu-Gi-Oh duels works could be mini-games.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>I currently have these things on the project:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Fullscreen Accessibility[/li]<br>
[li]Movable interfaces[/li]<br>
[li]A* Path Finding[/li]<br>
[li]Resource loading[/li]<br>
[li]Window Interfaces and widgets[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The repository is public, so please place some pull requests if you like. I know a lot of people will disagree with how I handle things, but no one is perfect; thatâ€™s why you make the pull requests for improvements!<br>

<p>I will set up the networking for multiplaying after the single player state is completely playable.</p>
<p>This would be in 3D if I had really good knowledge over that subject.</p>

<p>I know anyone would think that Iâ€™m trying to just make another pokemon game, but it wonâ€™t be like any other. Original things should come and will be enjoyed.</p>
<p>[hr]<span class="bbcode-b">Development on this will be delayed for a while; Iâ€™m taking a strong pain medication, so I wont be as functional.</span></p>
