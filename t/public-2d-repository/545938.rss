    <description>I want this game to have the features of multiple popular games, such as RuneScape, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, MineCraft, Mortal Combat, Inotia, and so on.... The player would be able to play every one of these games as a whole and enjoy it. The idea is to keep it single player with an option to host the current work you have.

I need everyone&#39;s help with this project, so please request anything on the repo so we can make this game better than ever :D


[ul][li]Hunger will be the same as MineCraft: giving fishing and cooking a good role. Player interaction will make the character hungrier.[/li]
[li]Building will be like MineCraft: giving construction a good role. Terrain can be generated randomly.[/li]
[li]Farming could be used to plant and harvest berries and herbs for potions to heal pokemon.[/li]
[li]Herblore would be used to make the potions.[/li]
[li]Smithing would be used to make armour for your pokemon[/li]
[li]Crafting could be used to make potion vials or poke balls[/li]
[li]Combat stats would be used for pokemon moves like PP, Power, Accuracy, etc[/li]
[li]Combat could be similar to mortal combat of 2012, where you would face opponents on a platform, and your moves would have mnemonics to them. The combat could be like Inotia, MineCraft, or even RuneScape.[/li]
[li]Collecting cards similar to Yu-Gi-Oh cards could be obtained to apply abilities to your pokemon. They could be replacements for TM/HMs[/li]
[li]Duels similar to how Yu-Gi-Oh duels works could be mini-games.[/li][/ul]


I currently have these things on the project:

[ul][li]Fullscreen Accessibility[/li]
[li]Movable interfaces[/li]
[li]A* Path Finding[/li]
[li]Resource loading[/li]
[li]Window Interfaces and widgets[/li][/ul]


The repository is public, so please place some pull requests if you like. I know a lot of people will disagree with how I handle things, but no one is perfect; that&#39;s why you make the pull requests for improvements!

I will set up the networking for multiplaying after the single player state is completely playable.

This would be in 3D if I had really good knowledge over that subject.

I know anyone would think that I&#39;m trying to just make another pokemon game, but it won&#39;t be like any other. Original things should come and will be enjoyed.

[hr][b]Development on this will be delayed for a while; I&#39;m taking a strong pain medication, so I wont be as functional.[/b]</description>
