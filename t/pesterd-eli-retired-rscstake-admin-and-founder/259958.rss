    <description>SOMEONE ELSE WILL BE TAKING OVER THE ADVERTISING

Well its been a long time.

Dear My fellow RSCStakers,
Its that part of a life cycle that forces a man or women to stop whatever childish things that they are doing and must move on. That time my friends, in NOW. I have been doing poorly in school and that is not the way my parents raised me to be. I was born to be a College drop out and I will be ending that thought and am officially retiring as RSCStake Administrator.

 * Thank You

Daniel/Sythetic=The founder and friend of whom I have had many joyous times with and although none of you newer members have known him I am sure everyone would have like him

Chase= My favorite friend in the whole entire RSC community. &#39;Nuff Said :P (MSN is always fun with you)

Dallas= A great and true friend, Ill miss those amazing stories of you getting blazed with Dan.

I wish all of the aforementioned people the best of luck in everything they do.

For everyone that I did not mention. It does NOT mean I forgot about you. I remember you all with good hearts but simply didnt want to spend hours on end typing my love stories for all of you.

The mods and admins, all of whom have made my RSCStake experience an enjoyable one.

I wish everyone the best of luck in everything you do.

Thank you for the good times,
Eli - Retired RSCStake Administrator and Founder

I will miss you all: Contact me!! fafus331@hotmail.com</description>

              <p>Cody, you must agree by changing the announcements on our forums shows absolutely no skill just a matter of laziness on our parts. As well as the fact that what you did wasnt coding in any way shape or form. And changing the banner? Come on. Anyone can just no one made us a NEW one yet. The code from Kasper was also bugged and crashed the server everytime you died by an NPC.</p>
<p>Chase is the one that fixed it.</p>

              <p>Well considering the fact that everything on that server that wasn’t done by Reines and the rscd team or the little bit of piece kasper got off yours, was added by me I don’t see how you’ve done anything to it. I’m guessing the other person is pesterd. Yeah I’m lazy and don’t like to mess with that shit, it isn’t as fun as i once thought it was. However, questioning skills that i may or may not have are none of your concern at all. I know what I can do and that’s all that matters to me.</p>
<p>As for your little threat, do your worst. I’m waiting.</p>

</aside>
<p>Just incase you didn’t know. It isn’t my server, And I don’t see how that even pertains to me being a “kid”. But i have changed a banner a number of times on different servers. I don’t see how shutting it down and telling people to go to your server helps at all in any way. How about you tell everyone the stuff you secretly did, because i sure would like to know what your work was.</p>
