    <description>So I thought I posted this in General Programming, but I accidentally posted it in Game Development? :S

Hey guys, just wanted to share a little project I&#39;ve been working on. It&#39;s not much, but I&#39;m pretty proud with the way it&#39;s turned out so far haha. So basically it&#39;s a bot for a RSPS (Soulsplit, if that counts as advertising, I&#39;ll remove it).

I don&#39;t know what else to tell you about it haha.

• Written in C#.
• Can create custom scripts (Pretty basic).
• Computer [b]ISN&#39;T[/b] usable while botting. (I tried SendMessage and PostMessage to simulate mouse clicks in an inactive window, but it didn&#39;t work, so I&#39;m using mouse_event).
• Moves your actual mouse. :(

Notes:
• GUI is messy, but I&#39;m trying to get the script loader/reader working 100% before I work on the GUI.
• The only reason this is for Soulsplit is because in the script you can move the camera (WriteProcessMemory), and the memory addresses/offsets would be different in other clients.

Features going to be added:
• Invalid player position (E.G if the bot messes up and clicks on something it wasn&#39;t supposed to, it would detect that it is on a tile that wasn&#39;t allowed, and restart the script/run).
• Try to get SendMessage/PostMessage to work so it can be inactive!
• Possible pixel color detection so you can see if an ore/tree is available/unavailable.
• Going to add more options like Mining different types of ore, Adding different types of trees for Woodcutting.
• Going to add scripts for most skills.
• Going to add the ability to load custom made scripts.
• Going to add commands like &#39;inventory&#39;, &#39;spellbook&#39;, &#39;closebank&#39;, &#39;depositall&#39;, &#39;deposititem,willow logs,1000,1/5/10/x/all&#39; that you can put in your scripts.

Example of a script:
[code]
x,500,500,none
y,383,500,none
754,289,1000,left
601,386,1500,left
265,521,5000,left
450,120,5000,left
071,136,5000,left
say,{F1},500,none
027,315,15000,left
113,350,15000,left
275,234,15000,left
201,273,15000,left
275,234,15000,left
201,273,15000,left
275,234,15000,left
201,273,15000,left
754,289,1000,left
601,386,1500,left
265,521,5000,left
300,208,2000,left
586,334,1000,right
583,404,2000,left
498,140,1000,left
242,309,1500,left
finish,loop,3000,5[/code]

Explanation:

Third argument is always how long you want to wait (in milliseconds) before executing the next action.

[b]123,456,1000,left[/b]
First and second arguments are the X and Y mouse coordinates, respectively. Fourth argument is what type of mouse click is used (left/right)

[b]x/y,500,500,none[/b]
First argument is what camera position you&#39;ll be changing. Second argument is the value you want the camera to be at. Fourth argument is &quot;none&quot; when you are using this command.

[b]say,::empty,1000,yes/no[/b]
First argument makes the user say something. Second argument is what you want to say. Fourth argument is whether you want to press Enter after it (May not be needed for switching to Inventory via F4)

[b][s]5000,5000,5000,5[/s][/b]
[b]finish,loop/stop,3000,5[/b]
First argument tells the program that the script has finished. Second argument tells the program to either do another run, or stop the script. Third argument is how long it waits before restarting the script (if you are looping it). Fourth argument tells the program where to start the next run at. E.G: With woodcutting, the script starts by moving your camera, teleports you to Draynor, walks to the trees, chops for a minute, then teleports back and deposits the logs, if you had argument four set to 0, it would move the camera and teleport again, but that isn&#39;t necessary to do after every run, and you might waste 5 - 10 seconds.

Anyway that&#39;s about it, nothing that special. :)

Also, if you have any suggestions or any questions about this program feel free to ask.

<p>My own little project I suppose, I’m just trying to see what I am capable of making haha. Also, I’ve been trying to make lots of different projects for different games/programs trying to find one that interests me, this one is doing it’s job pretty well so far. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
