    <title>Ubuntu to come on Dells</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ubuntu-to-come-on-dells/99728</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Now you no longer need to buy a machine with an OS already pre-loaded and then download Linux to make that machine better. Dell’s rumored Linux Ubuntu machines are launching today. You can order them directly from Dell. Someone correct me if I’m wrong (I usually am), but I believe this is the first time a major computer manufacturer has released machines that are preloaded with a Linux Operating system. A milestone indeed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>that, and the source is everywhere therefore, it would be like not-open office(payed edition) while you could get open office that has the same features because they tried to replicate it anyway, and got in the same features. The only downside to open office is it’s dumb system dictionary, it wouldn’t be hard to implant a digital dictionary add-in(optional download) for those that are doing biology, chemical, anything past college terms(my mom is a biologists, and she doesn’t like how it doesn’t know the words(this is in MS office as well)</p>

              <p>Quick, everyone jump on the “I hate Microsoft” train!</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with Microsoft. And I have tried Kubuntu.<br>
Let’s take a look at some features of both OS:</p>
<p>For Microsoft:<br>
Microsoft comes with stickers, Linux doesn’t. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Microsoft has straight-forward names for their software (eg: Internet Explorer) - Linux doesn’t (Konquerer?)<br>
Microsoft knows how to spell, Linux doesn’t (KDE, Konquerer, etc)<br>
Microsoft looks better (arguable and opinion based obviously)</p>
<p>For Linux:<br>
Faster then Windows (probably arguable, but I’m not an expert on the matter)<br>
Far better for webservers and the like because of stability (arguable but most likely true)<br>
More secure - probably because people that aim to attack computers are trying to hit a big group of people; they don’t waste their time with Linux because of it’s significantly smaller user-base. Could be wrong here too, but know that there will never be a flawless operating system security-wise.</p>
<p>There are more pros and cons for both OS.</p>
<p>I’d also like to point something else out - If you were a student in a class aiming to be top of the class, you’d find yourself working very hard (eg: Linux working hard to make open source better so it can hopefully match and overtake MS).<br>
However, what happens when you become number 1 and get comfortable? There’s a good chance you’ll start to take a break, relax a little.</p>
<p>What makes everyone think that Linux development and open source development won’t calm down and take a break if Linux overtakes Windows?<br>
What makes you all think that Linux software will stay predominately open source like it is now?</p>

But, Macs on the other hand is really good with media, but not office type of stuff, it really depends on what you want. But at the moment, I am stuck with windows as it is the only OS that lets me run the programs I want, and lets me have 2 screens(correctly)</p>

Dell thinks consumers are ready to try a new OS after living with a shitty one for some time now. Hopefully this will be the reversal of the OS empire. I hope Microsoft falls. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Although Dell’s machines really suck and need constant repairing(4 computers per day in my school, this is hardware, not just software) this is true that “This would result in better hardware support for linux” because linux needs it, and I still cannot get 2 screens on my Kubuntu and now it wont let me put the Res up as high as I did(it downgraded me to 1024 by 800 or something).<br>

<p>Need constant repairing? I’ve had a Dell Dimension 5000 for roughly 4 years and I’ve NEVER had to send it to be repaired, and I needed to send my laptop to be repaired ONCE, but it was completely my fault. (I was updating BIOS and turned power out half-way through).[/quote]<br>
Exactly. I have a Dell pc(7 years old) and a dell laptop(2 years old), and they both work perfectly.<br>
I don’t have a problem with dell other then the fact that they are overpriced.</p>

<p>And hp isnt that good in computers they are quite cheap i bout a laptop for 2,000 from them and it kept crashing my wirless network, because it had a freaking cheap wireless card on a expensive computer.</p>

              <p>well think of it this way, in the old days, before interchangeable parts idea came up, some guns would work just fine, while others after a while would degrade and would need to get custom parts or just get a new one. well I’m just saying not every dell is near perfection in manufacturing. In china, where most plastics are made for cheap things, some plastics have weak spots by the ingredients not being blended evenly or just thin spots, or just not having enough time to harden.<br>
Since Dell is cheap and in constant demand, the plastics are also, therefore they are rushed, so not all plastics are the same. Mostly what breaks in these computers are either the links to keep the heat sink on right, or a wire just shorted out because it wasn’t properly sealed. Also the computer repair man was talking with my dad(one time) and this is the conversation.</p>
<p>Brian(my father):I was thinking of buying a new computer, which brand would you suggest?<br>
PCMan:Well, HP is quite good, but don’t get a Dell.<br>
Brian:Why not, do you hate Dells or something?<br>
PCMan:No. No, I Love Dells, they’re what keeps me in business(smiles)</p>
<p>That is what I remember, it was quite funny at the time.</p>
