    <description>Hello, im the owner of Project Unforgiven, and were in need of a Head Mod, and Head Admin. You MUST have previous experience. You also MUST have a skype with a headset to be able to talk in the conversations verbally. Also for the Head Admin position you must have basic java coding capabilities! server is already up with a VPS hosted 24/7 (still in beta). Our current staff cant meet these requirements and are not ready for head postion. that is why im posting this. Please add my skype (xxpressyxx) if interested! before getting the position you will be interviewed by my co-owner and myself. Thanks! Good luck! Still alotta work to do tho, so if your interested in helping or applying hurry up, postions fill quickly!</description>
