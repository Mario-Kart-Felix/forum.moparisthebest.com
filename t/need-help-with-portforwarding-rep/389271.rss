    <title>Need help with Portforwarding || Rep++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-portforwarding-rep/389271</link>
    <description>Okay, this is a pretty nooby topic, so you Guru&#39;s should be able to help me with this. I&#39;ve portforwarded on my other laptop, but I just can&#39;t seem to do it right on this one.

Okay, so I know the router isn&#39;t the problem, because it&#39;s already got 43594 open. I know that the router is portforwarded cause I hosted a server on my old laptop, using the same router as I&#39;m using now.

Also, I know it&#39;s not my firewall, because I turned the firewall off for a bit, and I still couldn&#39;t get my server to connect.

So I don&#39;t have a single clue as to how to get this working.
________________________________

I&#39;ll go through what I&#39;ve done so far, so you can see if I missed a step.

Okay, so I downloaded No-IP first. I got it running, and added a host. 
Then, I made sure the router still had port 43594 open. It did.
Next, I opened up port 43594 in my firewall.
Fourth, I ran my server.
Fifth, I checked it on Runelocus&#39;s Server Status Checker, and used both my reg IP, and my No-IP, and it didn&#39;t work.
Then, I used 2 other sources, just to make sure it wasn&#39;t just that one.
Finally, I came here cause none of them worked.

All help is GREATLY appriciated guys.
