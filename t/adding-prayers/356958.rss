    <title>Adding Prayers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-prayers/356958</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking to add two prayers mostly on my 317 server. I would like to add Soul Split and Turmoil, to the same interface as the regular prayers. I would also like them to have the right emotes (e.g. turmoil he throws his hands up, soulsplit with the white things).

Can someone tell me how to do so? I have no idea even where to start.</description>
