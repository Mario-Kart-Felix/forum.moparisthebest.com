    <description>Hi Im Bonzakid and I&#39;m in the middle of making/coding a server. It is sort of like a dodian based but it will be more better for people to play and will be free unlike the dodian you have to pay if you want to be a &quot;premium&quot; member. The team and I which includes about 3 of us so far are introducing our new server which will be coming out in a few months.

The name is &quot;Claws Of Blood&quot;. I have however made the forums and will be on updating them and making more boards and stuff as I go aswell as coding the server. You can register up now at our forum at [url=http://clawsofblood.smfforfree4.com]http://clawsofblood.smfforfree4.com[/url] and keep in touch and know what is happening.

Also the Applications are coming soon! This will be on OUR forum site for the applications and not on here. So stay in touch with our forum website and you will be notified or know when theres stuff for you to get involved with!

Thanks and hope you enjoy.</description>
