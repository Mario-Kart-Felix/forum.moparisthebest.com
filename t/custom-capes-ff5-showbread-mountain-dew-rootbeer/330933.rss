    <title>Custom Capes! (FF5, Showbread, Mountain Dew, Rootbeer!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-capes-ff5-showbread-mountain-dew-rootbeer/330933</link>
    <description>[font=times new roman]Don&#39;t comment saying it&#39;s a stupid recolor. It&#39;s a waste of space, and a waste of time because really, it&#39;s not going to say anything to me.

Mountain Dew Cape - took about 3 hours for the logo.
Mug Root Beer Cape: (I think I want to add a little more to it.) - took about 6 hours for the logo.
Raw Rock Cape: (RAW ROCK KILLS!) - Showbread. - took about 30 minutes for the logo.
Family Force 5 Cape: (It wasn&#39;t meant to look pretty.. I like FF5, but I was bored &amp; really tired.. not paying attention, being really sloppy.) - took about 40 minutes for the FF5 logo.

Jagex for making the cape models
Amanda (Me) for making the logo.[/font]

I like em, I can see he spent lots of time making the logos resemble the real ones which is a good start.<br>
So maybe he will become a great modeler because he can see the smaller details.</p>

              <p>Chill out dude. There is nothing wrong with add things like that. It’s just for fun. Thought I would share it with people. not to mention, IT’S MORE THAN JUST RECOLOR! We are adding to them. Not just little things. The rootbeer logo took me about 6 hours to make. (Not easy!) …and it still isn’t technically finished. The Mountain Dew logo took me about 3 hours. The X-box logo took him about 20 minutes to do.<br>
BUT WHO CARES?<br>
If people like them, then people like them.</p>
<p>I’m not taking the credit for the cape model. I didn’t make it!<br>
I made the logo!!!<br>
It was just for FUN!<br>
Not even on my server. TAKE A CHILL PILL!</p>
<p>I used Metasequoia to make the logos. I felt like pasting it on something to see how it would look… I grabbed a grab because it was the first thing I saw. Devin is my brother, he saw what I was doing, wanted to try it out as well.</p>
<p>What’s a wireframe?</p>
<p>Forgive me for not being a “Genius.”<br>
If you tell me what it is, i’ll show you if I can.</p>
