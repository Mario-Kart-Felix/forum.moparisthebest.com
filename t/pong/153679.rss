    <description>this may be the wrong section if it is feel free to move it whereever it goes.
Well simple really i made a game of pong and then made a 2 player version in flash thought i would release because well i was bored. Anyway the two player has some bugs in it that i can&#39;t fix till next monday. the mian problem is this: player two can&#39;t go left whilst player 1 goes right or left otherwise the game ends :) good ain&#39;t it? this is because the controls for player 2 are the Ctrl key and the Alt key. The 1 player version has 3 difficulties and the right hand wall doesn&#39;t actually exist for paddles only for the ball :D don&#39;t know why just does. Its attached Hyper Pong is the next installment so look out for that</description>
