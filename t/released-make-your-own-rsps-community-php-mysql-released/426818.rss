<li>You did change a lot of variables.</li>
<li>You’ve added it so you can actually make a server premium - Although I created the database with a method to read it and for it to take effect in the cpanel.</li>
</ol>
<p>So nice for that, but it was still my base which wasn’t given to you and has broken the terms of an agreement which I must trace up in which you received this file.<br>
Remove ALL of my code from these files and repost.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Just spoken to Gage and he says you actually stole this from him after him allowing you to help edit the base as you had earned his trust knowing you were going to just take it.<br>
And yes, I think they are going to take legal action against you stealing and releasing their source code, I way well do the same thing to you about you using my base.</p>
<p>Goodbye.[/quote]</p>
<p>There is WAY to many complaints like that… I’m 14 dude… Legal action (Y) anyway… I wont take it down and I will not continue to update it… If you have a complaint about it take that up with moparscape and if they decide the same the post will be removed… Also I did not “Steal” this from gage. I used them files as a REFRERENCE point… I can almsot assume you are one of the 4 kids that came to me saying it there source code so as the point is now I DONT HAVE A CLUE WHOS SOURCE IT WAS… Like I said I used it as a reference point… and changed a BUNCH of thing into it… I released this so people can make communitys… and actrully discover php + mysql… Dont hate because I released this… I think the 4-6 people that used this tut… or even more that havnt posted will find this helpfull and say its fine to be… I just have to say that the kids that come to me and say this type of **** are very ignorent…</p>
<p>[B]EDIT:[b] Btw… All rsps content is copyrighted… The code may not be copyrighted but the webclients(loaders) ARE. I also had a disccussion with people… I released it and I am NOT using this code on a website… I may help someone who downloaded this but I’m definetly not using it on a website. Tops that someone is going to do is remove the post. I hate them kind of kids that think they can take legal action and talk shit. Most people on runescape private server communitys (Moparscape, Rune*ocus, Your communtiy, Others communitys) ARE KIDS… No need to talk legal ****.</p>
<p>[B]EDIT:[b] After time thinking about this… I decided I will just take the post down. I don’t feel like getting bitched at anymore… I’m not scared just dont feel like getting bitched at… Mop staff you may delete this… Anyone need me you may add me on here and then message me and I will tell you where to add me and I can help you with serten things here and there…</p>
<p>PS: You can thank the little ignorent kids… Sorry to all that liked this post…</p>

Ok, soo. I have a few questions. 1: Will the normal webclient loader tutorials work to make loaders for this?<br>

<p>That is the best question someone has asked me yet.</p>
<p>1: Yes the normal webclient loader tutorials… (I suggest googleing “Rsps loaders like rspsorg”) sence that is the actrul loader you are looking for.</p>
<p>2: Once you get the cache and jar your loaders put them in a dropbox folder “<a href="http://dropbox.com" rel="nofollow noopener">dropbox.com</a>” (Store in the “Public” folder that comes with dropbox) and then you will have to change some files (create.php) &lt;-- Thats just the main file you will have to change.[/quote]</p>
<p>Im way past that now, ive started on a basic toplist. Which displays the servers, shows there votes, and there owner. And also you click the name to take you too the url, took me awhile to get the php code work out, but works nicely. just gotta get voting system fixed, and also, there is a slight problem. If someone has spaces in there server name, it messes up the click url. Like Lol Lol would just be server=Lol and nothing else. Havent yet figured out that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

<p>I have know idea what you are talking about when you are say “taking an approach using an editor and a compiler”, there is no use for a compiler only notepad++ or some other advance program that can do the same things.</p>
<p>You all should just drop the IDE thing lol it was said and like 200 diffrent comments on it. &lt;-- that was an expression</p>
