    <title>Chess board</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chess-board/256986</link>
    <description>(I&#39;m not actually planning on making this in the near future, just trying to make a theoretical plan)

I enjoy playing chess, but there is noone near me that is equally strong as me. I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m good at it, just better then my dad. I play on the pc but without using a real chess board I suck. I make my moves way too fast without thinking about it. So I always use my laptop and a chess board. But sometimes I screw up, resulting in a fucked up game. So I was wondering, would it be hard to make a board that somehow recognizes the position of all the pieces. All I&#39;d have to do was do the moves that the pc tells me he wants to do, and my own. Without doing anything with the pc. I hope you understand what I mean.

But the thing is, how do you let the pc know where the pieces are? Using video input is error prone, just move your hand in front of the camera and the pc goes nuts. 

So how would you do it?</description>

Sorry for not answering your question but I don’t understand the difference. Why would you suck more when playing on a computer. Can’t you save yourself the money and just take your time?<br>

<p>I guess that could be it.</p>
<p>Edit: I know it also sounds odd that I want an electronic board and not a complete chess computer. But if you think about it, you know why. The better the chess computer, the more it costs. The cheap ones just look like a shapeless piece of Chinese shit.</p>
