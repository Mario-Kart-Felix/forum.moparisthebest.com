<p>Haha;3, well technically speaking it could only take one if the Dos’er had a better internet connection(upload and bandwidth wise) and capacity to use it but generally that doesn’t happen with VPS’s as vps’s have smexi internet connections. But usually people have 0.5 or less upload 2mbs upload at max but they’d still generally need around 50 people of that speed ddosing you at the same time :p.</p>

<p>On an ‘standard’ vps, my guess is about 400-600 connections doing the same action at the same time (Just say sending back a login packet) before it crashes. Also depends on how good the server was coded.</p>

Its dos if one person, ddos if multiple people do it to one person/server. Whoever has the best internet connection will come out on top basically, if the person getting dos/ddos’ed has a better internet at best the attempt will only slow them down. It works by sending so many packets not allowing the victim to reach the internet…<br>
Idc about your dos story because dos’ing is silly and illegal… stay away from it. Whats an iptable…?</p>

<p>Well in that cause dont host a rsps, why would you risk hosting on your computer, easier chance of getting DDosed.[/quote]<br>
Assuming they have a better internet connection than you… Personally I’m getting upgraded to 60mbs internet however I’m not hosting myself anyways and its Dos Ddos is multiple people.<br>
No need to risk, I only would use a webclient if I hosted so they’d have to decompile my client just to find my ip even then I can change my Ip in under a minute so its just a lil bit of hastle not much.<br>
But then again why would they go to all that hastle if it would only take me 2mins to get around it o.o, also I believe you can input the ip html wise also(not 100% sure) so I wouldn’t have to rejar then again they’d need only to check my pages source but then again why would someone go to that much effort over a rsps? o.o<br>
Its not a risk for me, also its not common to get ddosed tbh. In time for donations for a vps you most likely wont get dosed.</p>
