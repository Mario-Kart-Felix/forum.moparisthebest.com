    <description>Whenever I try changing item names or descriptions, or npc health, or pretty much anything besides what items appear in the general stores, I save the file and then when I load moparscape back up and login everything is still the way it was before I changed it. How can I make the changes work right? Yes, I am a noob at this, but I am really interested in this and I am willing to work with it and try to figure it out. ^_^</description>
