    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-use-a-moparscape-server/231494</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve searched all over the furoms and i would like to know how to use someones server. I do not want i guide on making one (there are plenty of those) I just want to know how to use one that has been set up. I downloaded all their stuff and unzipped it, but i have no idea how to use it. Right now all i have is a bunch of computer data and no game :(. So could someone please direct to a tutorial or just explain on this thread how to use servers. (you&#39;ll have to be patience i&#39;m completly new to this kind of thing)</description>
