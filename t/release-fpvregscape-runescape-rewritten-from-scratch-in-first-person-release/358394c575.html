<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/mistabigboss-2.html">@MistaBigBoss</a>, why is the title STILL “rewritten from <span class="bbcode-b">scratch</span> in First Person”<br>
[/quote]Because your not my dad to tell me what to do or what to do not, that’s why. For your information I wrote the FPS scripts myself, it’s trugh they are based on Unity’s but mainly made by me. I made them myself instead of copying them for learning more about Unity + writing a game in someone elses company is still considered as writing something from scratch. It’s like modeling from scratch, you model with someone elses modeling software, I don’t see you creating your own 3DS Max now don’t I. So once again go the fuck out (incase you don’t know what gtfo means since I used it multiple times).</p>
<p>Anyways I’m going to get sum sleep peace out.[/quote]GTFO = get the fuck off/out, retard.</p>
<p>And I’m sorry, but you did not write most of the FPS scripts. You followed tutorials and the code was mostly already there. Not only that, but this is hardly ‘RuneScape’. You don’t have multiplayer, NPCs or anything like that (from what I saw in the video, I don’t want to download a piece of crap like this, waste of HDD)</p>
<p>And I don’t see any modeling program here, so why even bother telling us about it. As for who you leeched - Jagex and Unity. Jagex, because it’s their models and maps that you took. This is different from RSPS in so many ways, so don’t bother telling me that you can leech this because we leech rsps. And Unity, because even though you give credits, you  still say you wrote this from scratch, even when it comes down to it, you probably didn’t do even 1% of the work that is required to make a game like this. (That last sentence is my case in point)</p>

<p>Davidi2 I wish m.dog311’s ban was never removed because what he said was true: no one wants you here. Your argument is invalid. This server is the same as someone releasing a server off winterLove. Consider MBB’s engine as winterLove and everything is the same - look at your DavidScape which is based off Bulby and people rep you for that.</p>
<p>MBB has purposely stated that this server only has single-player support for people like you can’t read. It doesn’t have to have a multi-player support. I’m sure you usually say ‘please leave arguments out of my thread’ when you see people argue in your own.</p>
<p>The fact that you are so sore over him getting rep for releasing this shows that rep matters to you, hypocrite. Yay me for hunting down a quote by you:</p>

<p>Now you can leave the topic because MBB has credited the sources.</p>
<p>Edit: MBB, ignore the haters and move on. Don’t care about a minority of those who do not like it.[/quote]I’m so glad you replied to this <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Your first sentence is a hypocrisy all to itself. If we take a look at your last sentence, you talk about how MBB should not care about the minority of people that don’t like it. Now in the first sentence, you say how ‘no one wants me here.’ The people that don’t want me here (&lt; 5) is FAR less than the amount that do want me here/don’t care; hence a minority; hence why no one should care about them. Also, if you think mdogs ban should have been removed, it only means you support the abuse of power on this forum, as I gave proof to the subject, and my ban was removed within 5 minutes of me showing it.</p>
<p>As for wL and the engine, I’m sorry, but how much do you know about it? It’s nothing similar. Firstly, look at wL and my base, how much do you see is similar? Not much. The only reason you can even mention wL is because it was the first base, and it set the platform for all the others. People write new sources from scratch, it’s not like my base is off of wL. Not only that, but in this case, the Engine does everything for him, he used included scripts, and he plugs information into it to get what he wans. I write my own code for my server, and that’s what people like. If all I did was follow tutorials for DavidScape, no one would ever have repped me for it. And if you think I got all of my rep from my source, you are also very sadly mistaken.</p>
<p>The only reason I mentioned multiplayer is because of  how hypocritical his thread title and his post is. He says he wrote this from scratch, when in fact he did the opposite, and wrote none of it himself without tutorials. He says it’s RuneScape, when RuneScape supports multiplayer. RuneScape has all sorts of features that MBB can’t add, probably because there are no tutorials on them.</p>
<p>Now how stupid you are really shines through, because not only does that quote not say that I don’t care about rep, it says I DO. ‘I’m obviously <span class="bbcode-b">not the only one</span> that cares,’ So how is that hypocrisy? Nice try bud. Now I care about it, because people see someone with 200 rep, and they think ‘wow! this guy must be good!’ Now if I asked MBB a question about something in this game, I would assume he could answer it because he has 200 rep. I would be disappointed to learn that all he could tell me is what the tutorial taught him.</p>
<p>Now, if you would learn to read, I stated what I want in order to leave the thread, not just the credits.</p>
<p>Thank you.<br>

Suggestion: Stop the arguments.</p>
<p>Davidi2 I wish m.dog311’s ban was never removed because what he said was true: no one wants you here. Your argument is invalid. This server is the same as someone releasing a server off winterLove. Consider MBB’s engine as winterLove and everything is the same - look at your DavidScape which is based off Bulby and people rep you for that.</p>
<p>MBB has purposely stated that this server only has single-player support for people like you can’t read. It doesn’t have to have a multi-player support. I’m sure you usually say ‘please leave arguments out of my thread’ when you see people argue in your own.</p>
<p>The fact that you are so sore over him getting rep for releasing this shows that rep matters to you, hypocrite. Yay me for hunting down a quote by you:</p>

</aside>
<p>Now you can leave the topic because MBB has credited the sources.</p>
<p>Edit: MBB, ignore the haters and move on. Don’t care about a minority of those who do not like it.<br>
[/quote]I’m so glad you replied to this <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Your first sentence is a hypocrisy all to itself. If we take a look at your last sentence, you talk about how MBB should not care about the minority of people that don’t like it. Now in the first sentence, you say how ‘no one wants me here.’ The people that don’t want me here (&lt; 5) is FAR less than the amount that do want me here/don’t care; hence a minority; hence why no one should care about them. Also, if you think mdogs ban should have been removed, it only means you support the abuse of power on this forum, as I gave proof to the subject, and my ban was removed within 5 minutes of me showing it.</p>
<p>As for wL and the engine, I’m sorry, but how much do you know about it? It’s nothing similar. Firstly, look at wL and my base, how much do you see is similar? Not much. The only reason you can even mention wL is because it was the first base, and it set the platform for all the others. People write new sources from scratch, it’s not like my base is off of wL. Not only that, but in this case, the Engine does everything for him, he used included scripts, and he plugs information into it to get what he wans. I write my own code for my server, and that’s what people like. If all I did was follow tutorials for DavidScape, no one would ever have repped me for it. And if you think I got all of my rep from my source, you are also very sadly mistaken.</p>
<p>The only reason I mentioned multiplayer is because of  how hypocritical his thread title and his post is. He says he wrote this from scratch, when in fact he did the opposite, and wrote none of it himself without tutorials. He says it’s RuneScape, when RuneScape supports multiplayer. RuneScape has all sorts of features that MBB can’t add, probably because there are no tutorials on them.</p>
<p>Now how stupid you are really shines through, because not only does that quote not say that I don’t care about rep, it says I DO. ‘I’m obviously <span class="bbcode-b">not the only one</span> that cares,’ So how is that hypocrisy? Nice try bud. Now I care about it, because people see someone with 200 rep, and they think ‘wow! this guy must be good!’ Now if I asked MBB a question about something in this game, I would assume he could answer it because he has 200 rep. I would be disappointed to learn that all he could tell me is what the tutorial taught him.</p>
<p>Now, if you would learn to read, I stated what I want in order to leave the thread, not just the credits.</p>
<p>Thank you.<br>
Davidi2[/quote]Listen Davidi, it doesn’t mean that you use tutorials on all your work that I do, I made some games on Unity WITH tutorials that I never released. This I made 100% bymyself, as I said many times before I WROTE THE SCRIPTS MYSELF based on the Unity scripts for trying to understand them. That’s how people learn something and if you’d ask me a question about this I’d be glad to answer it. Since you keep coming back on my thread due to multiple requests to leave it, I’d like to know if there’s an option to ask the mods for telling Davidi to stay out of my thread. If anyone knows this is possible please send me a pm or write it down here.</p>

<p>Also, people don’t leave threads because you don’t like getting the truth told to you. You need to accept it, and make changes if you want people to leave.[/quote]Unity renders the models in DirectX 9/OpenGL.<br>
And attack is done by using animation and then triggering that animtion with a script that tells the model to play the animation while at the same time it deals healt off the target your attacking wich is also written in the script and I did not copy and paste it I first studied the scripts tried to understand them and then I wrote them without the unity example next to it, you should really stop being such a jerk and accept the fact that your just a jealous cunt who only thinks about rep, rep and some more rep and if someone gets some rep, then you have to find things to start a discussion with them totally agreed with Rixxxx said. And as far as inb4 Google goes, idk what tht means.</p>

I didn’t ask for what it renders them with.</p>
<p>And your attack response is so generic, I could say that about RS as well. Even someone new to this could guess that. I meant deep down, what does the engine do.<br>

Tell me one thing here I have to be jealous about. It’s not rep, I have 200 already. I do care that you got 200 from this easy piece of no-work, but I’m not jealous about it. And I don’t only care about rep, I stated about 50 times what my real reason for posting these things are. It’s that you did NO WORK.</p>
