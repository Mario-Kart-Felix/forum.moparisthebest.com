    <title>Needing a book report</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/needing-a-book-report/234463</link>
    <description>I need a book report over the book Cover-Up: mystery at the super bowl by john feinstein.

it needs to be in this format and its overall points are 200.

[code]GUIDELINES:	Typed 12pt. Times New Roman
Double Spaced
3 pages
1” Margins


Report should indent each new paragraph only five spaces. There should not be any extra spaces after the title, or between paragraphs. Paragraphs should NOT be numbered or labeled.[/code]


[code]Introduction: the introduction must have a thesis statement (the sentence that states what the rest of the report is going to be about). Provide background information to set up the rest of the report. You could include the setting. Introduction should be roughly 4 to 5 sentences in length.[/code]


[code]Character Analysis: Write a separate paragraph for each man character. The descriptions should be written in complete sentences in normal report format just like the rest of the report. Give an in depth description for each character including: physical description, personality traits, strengths, and weaknesses; how they deal with pressure, stress, and society. Try to look deeper into the character than just what the book tells you, use context clues to figure out what the character is really like.[/code]


[code]Plot Development: Give a brief summarization of the story, DO NOT GIVE PLAY-BY-PLAY detail of the story. You should focus on the man events of the story. I want you to explain how you relate these events to modern life. I want to know what you can take away from the book and how you interact with it. The following items should be evident in your report: how the events and instances relate to modern society, what moral or lesson can be learned, main topics and theme (examples from the story to support it), how do the events in the book affect other characters and the overall outcome of the story.[/code]


[code]Evaluation: The evaluation should be approximately one paragraph (four to five sentences). I want to see how you form opinions and critique literature.  Point out some of the literary devices (metaphors, similes, irony, personification, etc.) you found in the story. How does the author’s use of these devices affect your overall understanding of the story?[/code]



date got expanded to friday the 17th..

also if you could just put it in a code tag when you have it finished seeing how i have to print it off at the school.</description>

<p>It’s in your best interest to have it done and no-one else’s. This section is for help not for lazy niggers to ask for help with shit they can’t be arsed to because they’re out being cool getting community service sentences.</p>

              <p>I think I can safely say that no one’s going to take 5 hours out of their time to write you a book report. So you may as well get started on it yourself if it’s due on the 7th…</p>

              <p>I need a book report over the book Cover-Up: mystery at the super bowl by john feinstein.</p>
<p>it needs to be in this format and its overall points are 200.</p>
<p>[code]GUIDELINES:	Typed 12pt. Times New Roman<br>
Double Spaced<br>
3 pages<br>
1” Margins</p>
<p>Report should indent each new paragraph only five spaces. There should not be any extra spaces after the title, or between paragraphs. Paragraphs should NOT be numbered or labeled.[/code]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Introduction: the introduction must have a thesis statement (the sentence that states what the rest of the report is going to be about). Provide background information to set up the rest of the report. You could include the setting. Introduction should be roughly 4 to 5 sentences in length.</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Character Analysis: Write a separate paragraph for each man character. The descriptions should be written in complete sentences in normal report format just like the rest of the report. Give an in depth description for each character including: physical description, personality traits, strengths, and weaknesses; how they deal with pressure, stress, and society. Try to look deeper into the character than just what the book tells you, use context clues to figure out what the character is really like.</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Plot Development: Give a brief summarization of the story, DO NOT GIVE PLAY-BY-PLAY detail of the story. You should focus on the man events of the story. I want you to explain how you relate these events to modern life. I want to know what you can take away from the book and how you interact with it. The following items should be evident in your report: how the events and instances relate to modern society, what moral or lesson can be learned, main topics and theme (examples from the story to support it), how do the events in the book affect other characters and the overall outcome of the story.</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Evaluation: The evaluation should be approximately one paragraph (four to five sentences). I want to see how you form opinions and critique literature.  Point out some of the literary devices (metaphors, similes, irony, personification, etc.) you found in the story. How does the author’s use of these devices affect your overall understanding of the story?</code></pre>
<p>date got expanded to friday the 17th…</p>
<p>also if you could just put it in a code tag when you have it finished seeing how i have to print it off at the school.</p>
