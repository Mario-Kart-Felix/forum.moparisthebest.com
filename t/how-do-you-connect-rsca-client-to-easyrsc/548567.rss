does it really matter why?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yes, it does.  I was told for years to stay away from easyrsc from reputable people around these forums.  I was curious as to why you would want to do this?</p>
<p>As for you aleka, stop making your lame accusations bro it’s really getting old.  Where is it that I’m putting down any other server? Check my posts around I am positive in other servers.  You are just still mad that I shut you down when You wanted to work with me.  Keep working with brwn on that server where you cannot fix dupes and crashes that still exist in the server to this day for the 2 years its been online-- you are going to go very far with it![/quote]</p>
<p>Shut me down? Your dumbass should have tooken my offer now look at your server. 0 online everyday! All our glitches were fixed a long time ago. You run a fail server and you will never get anywhere. I don’t need to take advice from someone who can’t change a wamp favicon.<br>
I’m just going to leave this thread here for anyone that wants a good laugh at slaypk:<br>

I already made you sit down one time. You might want to keep my name out of your mouth “vibes” whoops I meant slaypk.<br>
There are also other threads where other players embarrassed you as well.</p>

<p>No it’s just that his server is so irrelevant his trying to put others down.</p>
<p>Compare the mudclient.java in the rsca client and the actual easyrsc mudclient.java<br>
Use this site <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.diffchecker.com/</a></p>
<p>It will show you the difference between the two mudclients.</p>
<p>You can also update the conf folder (animations, npcs, sprites) with the Easyrsc one.</p>
