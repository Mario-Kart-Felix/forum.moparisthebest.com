    <description>Protecting the patron saint of pedophiles.
I am so damn proud of my country...

Theres one law for them and another law for everyone else.


&lt;blockquote&gt;The Government has moved to prevent the possibility of an arrest warrant being issued against the Pope during his state visit this autumn.

Sky News understands that Whitehall officials have been &quot;seriously concerned&quot; that campaigners would use international criminal rules to try to detain the Pontiff while he is in the UK.

Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC were among those campaigners reported to be looking at the options for bringing a private prosecution in relation to the Pope&#39;s alleged cover-up of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.

Now Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has proposed changes to the rules on universal jurisdiction, a law that allows individuals to be prosecuted in the UK for serious offences such as war crimes, crimes against humanity and torture even if they were carried out abroad.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The UK government is said to have set in motion a law change that will prevent the Pope from being arrested when he visits the country in September.
Officials in Whitehall – the UK government’s administrative offices – are said to be worried over plans by the atheist authors Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens to have Pope Benedict arrested for crimes against humanity, because of his alleged cover-up of priestly assaults on children.
“Mr Dawkins, the atheist campaigner, and Mr Hitchens, an atheist author, asked human rights lawyers in April to put together a case for charging the Pope over his alleged cover-up of sexual abuse of children in the Catholic Church,” reports Pink News today.
Its report adds: “Justice Secretary Ken Clarke proposed changes to the law today which would require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions to any arrest warrant issued under universal jurisdiction.”
The Pope’s proposed visit has ever been free of controversy since it was announced last year.
A recent suggestion by the Pope’s second-in-command, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, that child abuse and paedophilia were connected with homosexuality brought condemnation even from fellow Catholics in the UK.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Oh come on UK government, just take a deep breath and state you will take the same stance against the Pope that you did against Geert Wilders trying to enter the country (another federal representative governer of a (real) country!).

Go on, I dare ya!


Good to see the UK government taking on the concerns of its citizens and not just changing laws to protect despot leaders that they are chums with.</description>
