    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/yet-another-religious-thread/314842</link>
    <description>Despite experience from previous threads, I will try again: STICK TO THE TOPIC! The topic is the similaritys between Horus and Jesus.

Jesus:
Virgin birth
Witness to birth: three kings
Birthplace located by a star
Herod tried to murder him when he was a child
Age at passage ritual: 12
Age at baptism: 30
Fate of baptizer: beheading
Tempted by his arch rival in the desert(Satan), which he resists
Followers: 12 diciples
Walked on water, healed the sick
Raised Lazarus in Bethanu, or house of Anu
Died by crucifixion
Resurrected after 3 days

Horus:
Virgin birth
Birth witnessed by 3 solar deities
Birthplace located by a star
Herut tried to murder him when he was a child
Age at passage ritual: 12
Age at baptism: 30
Fate of baptizer: beheading
Tempted by his arch rival in the desert(Set), which he resists
Followers: 12
Walked on water, healed the sick
Raised his father in the city of Anu
Died by crucifixion
Resurrected after 3 days

http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_jcpa5d.htm for more similarities.

So, let us discuss this. First of, Christians: how do you explain these similarities? 

I explain them as follows: Many, if not all, religions are based on one thing: Astrology. The birth of both Horus and Jesus was announced by a star. In the bible you can read that three kings followed a star to the birthplace of Jesus. An interesting fact is that you can draw a straight line over the Orion belt (interestingly called the three kings), over the star Sirius, to the place where the sun rises in late December. The way I see it, is that every religion, including the Greek, Christian, Nord, etc religion is based on the movement of the stars. Stars are personified in many religions. For instance, the sun is seen as a chariot by the Greeks. Constellations are seen as gods.

So, I ask you: do you believe in the son of a god, or the Sun?</description>

              <blockquote>By the Nineteenth dynasty, the enmity between Set and Horus, in which Horus had ripped off one of Set's testicles, was represented as a separate tale. According to Papyrus Chester-Beatty I, Set is depicted as trying to prove his dominance by seducing Horus and then having intercourse with him. However, Horus places his hand between his thighs and catches Set's semen, then subsequently throws it in the river, so that he may not be said to have been inseminated by Set. Horus then deliberately spreads his own semen on some lettuce, which was Set's favorite food (the Egyptians thought that lettuce was phallic). After Set has eaten the lettuce, they go to the gods to try to settle the argument over the rule of Egypt. The gods first listen to Set's claim of dominance over Horus, and call his semen forth, but it answers from the river, invalidating his claim. Then, the gods listen to Horus' claim of having dominated Set, and call his semen forth, and it answers from inside Set.</blockquote>

<p>Horus:<br>

Birth witnessed by 3 solar deities<br>
Birthplace located by a star<br>
Herut tried to murder him when he was a child<br>

Fate of baptizer: beheading<br>

<p><a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_jcpa5d.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_jcpa5d.htm</a> for more similarities.</p>
<p>So, let us discuss this. First of, Christians: how do you explain these similarities?</p>
<p>I explain them as follows: Many, if not all, religions are based on one thing: Astrology. The birth of both Horus and Jesus was announced by a star. In the bible you can read that three kings followed a star to the birthplace of Jesus. An interesting fact is that you can draw a straight line over the Orion belt (interestingly called the three kings), over the star Sirius, to the place where the sun rises in late December. The way I see it, is that every religion, including the Greek, Christian, Nord, etc religion is based on the movement of the stars. Stars are personified in many religions. For instance, the sun is seen as a chariot by the Greeks. Constellations are seen as gods.</p>
<p>So, I ask you: do you believe in the son of a god, or the Sun?</p>
