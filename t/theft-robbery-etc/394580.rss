    <title>Theft, robbery, etc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/theft-robbery-etc/394580</link>
    <description>It&#39;s becoming insane the amount of robbery that&#39;s happening. 
I&#39;ve been robbed twice in the last week.
I&#39;ve put my chests in a sealed room, and walled it off from the nearest ext with 4 layers of netherrack. 
The thief then decided to go around, through the stone and then go at my stuff. 
Other people&#39;s villages are becoming targets, too. Ask piggle. I think it&#39;s 2 - 3 times in the last week. 
Can we put some kind of stop to this?</description>

You have also obviously not read the thread rules. Minimal griefing is allowed when looking for chests around a house. It is also allowed when invading someones house so you can kill them.</p>
