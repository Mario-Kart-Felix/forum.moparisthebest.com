    <title>What job for someone who can&#39;t read or write?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-job-for-someone-who-cant-read-or-write/251112</link>
    <description>Ok, before i start, i want to make it perfectly clear that this is a serious topic. so please dont turn this into a stupid thread.

My girlfriend lives about 30 to 45 mins away. This puts a major strain on the relationship because i work 5 days out of the week, saturday being one of them. so can&#39;t really go to see her anymore. 

I want her to move down to me and to get a place with me. 


Problem is, she has a learning disability in the sense that words dont work in her head. She cannot read and write very well. Now i didnt even notice this till she told me a few months after i met her, so she&#39;s not stupid, and she can get by with the little reading and writing she does.


but i need to get her a job if she moves down to me. At the moment, she is a dish cleaner at a restaurant. she works 5 mornings a week and pulls in near $250. Because of her &#39;disability&#39; she qualifies for the pension, which brings up her weekly earning to $250, if she earns less.


What other jobs could someone get that doesnt need you to read, write, use numbers, etc.</description>

<p>Wait, just because she finds reading and writing harder than some people - Doesn’t mean she’s any less capable, she just needs more time to ease into the task at hand. And especially since a Taxi Driver just gets a radio controller telling them where to go, all she has to do is read the number off the meter for the price and the job’s a good 'un.</p>

<p>Is it something that has to do with the short term memory? A mate of mine had that and he is doing fine.</p>

If her social skills are fine, she’ll do fine. From what I read, she isn’t stupid so keep her away from hamburger flipping or something similar.</p>
