    <description>Hey, so i am trying to add a third option to a right click for players which says PlayerShop. I am trying to edit PlayerOption but when i try to get the packet it doesn&#39;t open what i want. Here is the code:
[CODE]    public static final int FIRST_OPTION = 70;
    public static final int TRADE_PLAYER = 27; // RIGHT!
    public static final int FOLLOW_PLAYER = 80;
	public static final int OPEN_PLAYERSHOP = 60;

    @Override
    public void handlePacket(Player player, Message packet) {
        switch (packet.getOpcode()) {
            case FIRST_OPTION:
                handleFirstOption(player, packet);
                break;
            case TRADE_PLAYER:
                handleTradeRequest(player, packet);
                break;
            case FOLLOW_PLAYER:
                Following.playerFollow(player, World.getWorld().getPlayers().get(packet.readLEShortA()));
                break;
			case OPEN_PLAYERSHOP:
                player.sendMessage(&quot;Player Shops coming soon!&quot;);
                break;	
        }
    }[/CODE]

Maybe I have the OPEN_PLAYERSHOP = int wrong? Can someone fix it so it works?
Thanks.</description>
