    <title>Best method to attack designing main content on a website</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-method-to-attack-designing-main-content-on-a-website/478786</link>
    <description>I am good at designing the basic look of a website, but when it gets to the main content, blogs/whatever else goes in the main content, I cannot think of anything that looks nice. I have always had trouble designing this, so since I have been a part of this community for a while I decided why not ask here. Any tips on designing main content and making it look baws?</description>

              <p>I do it depending on what the website’s main function is, for example: RuneRebels. They’re a runescape private server and a very important aspect for their players is the announcements. Therefore I listed their two latest announcements from the database using the SMF SSI’s boardNews() function. This gets across the main information. I then took advantage of a 3 column layout below that. This then gets across the three secondary points of their server: how to play, communicating through the IRC and donations. They wouldn’t have any players if they didn’t know how to play. Since it’s a remake there’s no yell command or what not so communicating through the forums can take time, so I gave them information on the IRC channel/applet and then without the voluntary donors we wouldn’t have anything to pay for the hosting costs besides AdSense so that’s another main part, without hosting we’d not have a server for the player base.</p>
<p>However, I also often put an image slider just below the navbar followed by a three column layout and sometimes with thumbnails on the columns, depending on what flows. That’s the main way I look at it.</p>
<p>EDIT: From the localhost test <a href="http://puu.sh/1PTdF" rel="nofollow noopener">http://puu.sh/1PTdF</a> and <a href="http://puu.sh/1PTeh" rel="nofollow noopener">http://puu.sh/1PTeh</a></p>
