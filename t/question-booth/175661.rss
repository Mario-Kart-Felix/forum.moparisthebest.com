    <title>Question booth</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-booth/175661</link>
    <description>well i was hoping there was some way to make an npc say a custom command. This is my idea. I want for someone to say a command such as ::qon player1 this will make the npc say &quot;player1 is accepting questions at booth 1.&quot; then another command that would be ::qoff player1 and the npc would say &quot;Noone is currently answering questions at booth 1.&quot; and i was hoping it could be for two different npcs. Thanks i know this is a lot to ask for but i was hoping someone could help me with this. Oh the npcs i would want is npc 979 and npc 980.</description>
