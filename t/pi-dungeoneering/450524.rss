    <description>When a player is in the Dungeon and they die they teleport them back to home. 
I need help when they die that the server knows that they have left The Dungeoneering Area.
Dont know how but players are losing there items when they leave the area.
Then they loose all the worn items they have.
This is the current code for when they die.
[code]if (Dungeoneering.Dung(c)) {
				c.getItems().deleteAllItems();
				}[/code]
Dont know what to do.
I need it to recognize it left that area.
Any help would be appreciated.</description>
