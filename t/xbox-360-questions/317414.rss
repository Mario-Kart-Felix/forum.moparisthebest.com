    <title>Xbox 360 Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xbox-360-questions/317414</link>
    <description>Well, since it&#39;s Christmas time I am planning on spending some money on an Xbox 360. I will be buying Live, etc. I am just wondering what I should buy with it.

First off, what Xbox 360 version should I buy? I can buy a bundle pack with 60GB, the Elite with 120GB, or I can buy the 360 refurbished, etc. I want the best quality.

Second, reccommend me some games. I know for sure already I will be getting MW2.

Questions:

How many times have YOU gotten the Red Ring of Death? This is my main concern when buying this. I know that you get a 3 year warranty, but after that you have to pay? There is also a guide on YT about fixing the RRoD manually, but I don&#39;t want to mess with it without having some information first about sending it in to Microsoft. I know that the most common cause of the RRoD is overheating. I heard an intercooler and the towel trick just make it worse. If I set my xbox 360 vertical and outside of cabinets so it can circulate cool air, etc. and have a small fan blow towards it, would that keep it cool enough to play for multiple hours a day?

If I want to play against other people on live, do I have to hook something up to my router or computer and have a long ass cord going halfway across my house?

I will take ANY reccommendations. I want good quality and information. Thanks!  :)</description>

I’m pretty sure that doesn’t come with the cable, etc. I’m not sure if our walmart around us even has a bundle like that.</p>
<p>Also most reviews I have seen on the intercooler have been negative against the product.[/quote]<br>
I use the intercooler, and it works fine for me. But my Wal-Mart has the Elite with all the stuff it normally comes with, along with MW2 and a month of free live to test MW2.</p>

Everyone complains about the vitality of the console. There have been many charts, polls, etc., concerning the Xbox 360’s problems. What they don’t mention is the fact that you can, if you’ve purchased the warranty, send in your Xbox with nearly any problem and they’ll fix it for free. My friends have also said that they’ve received free live gold membership because of their inconveniences. So don’t let the error rate push you away from a great console overall.<br>

<p>It’s not really the error rate anymore, it’s the wonder if 500-550 dollars is worth it.[/quote]</p>
<p>It is believe me.</p>

I bought an old Xbox 360 (The one were 20gb was the main storage device) and I’ve had it for a year, playing constantly. I’m hoping to get a bigger HDD so I’d suggest going for atleast the Premium (60GB HDD).</p>
<p>As for RRoD. Played a year, constantly no RRoD (Apart from when I spilled milk over the damn power adapter :()<br>

<p>You drink milk?[/quote]</p>
<p>No. I was having cereal upstairs.</p>

              <p>Everyone complains about the vitality of the console. There have been many charts, polls, etc., concerning the Xbox 360’s problems. What they don’t mention is the fact that you can, if you’ve purchased the warranty, send in your Xbox with nearly any problem and they’ll fix it for free. My friends have also said that they’ve received free live gold membership because of their inconveniences. So don’t let the error rate push you away from a great console overall.</p>

I’ve had mine since '06, gotten 2 rrods, but i just rebooted my xbox and it was fine.</p>
<p>Games: Gta 4 is fun, do not get gow 2, it is a complete fucking joke. Don’t bother with halo 3 if your getting mw2. Good rpgs are Oblivion and Fallout 3, oblivion is better because it’s more immersive. Get rechargable battery packs for your controllers, won’t have to worry about double a’s. Turtle beach x1’s are $60 headsets, they plug into your 360 and your tv, and have AMAZING quality. I’ve tried them out with mw2, and it’s insane, everything sounds way different with them. They also cancel out most noise, so you won’t hear someone if there calling you.</p>
<p>You can hook up netflix with your xbox so you can stream movies on it, all free with subscription too.<br>

<p>recharagable battery packs?<br>
i use a lead that leads up to my xbox when the controller is almost out of battery… a few hrs and you can use it for like, 5 hr +…[/quote]</p>
<p>same shit</p>
<p>You can find a wireless adaptor for your xbox for $35, don’t pull a dumbass move like me and buy the xbox one for $100</p>

<p>Infamous is a ps3 exclusive, and warning him not to get prototype because it gets boring quick is a bit ridiculous when you list L4D2 ANNNNNNND Assasins Creed 2. Ok, that was a bit unfair, I haven’t played Assasins Creed 2 but if it is ANYTHING like the original then the charm won’t last a week.</p>

<p>Xbox 360 Refurbished = 216.50(around that, 216 is the amount of dollars), cod 4 Pre Owned = 27 99.</p>
