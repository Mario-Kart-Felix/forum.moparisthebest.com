    <title>End of bots?</title>

    <description>http://services.runescape.com/m=news/c=zjWyemuYWU8/bot-busting-and-bonuses-for-all

&lt;blockquote&gt;The project, code-named the ‘ClusterFlutterer’, will be launched as part of the RuneScape game update on Tuesday the 25th October permanently preventing “reflection” bots from working again.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We anticipate that next Tuesday will go down in RuneScape history as &#39;bot-nuking day&#39;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What are they talking about?

Offtopic:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Slayer skill day: All Slayer XP earned from killing assigned targets will be tripled. Some monsters will have a faster respawn time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Oh come on now.. what was the point of me slaying whole 4 nights straight to get 99?  :mad:
Game gets easier and easier and people run out of stuff to do when maxed quickly.</description>

<p>Yep, they are rising as we speak, check frost drag bones prices.</p>
<p>Also, GP prices are rising too, a site I bought gp off, the prices went from .56 to .58 :o</p>

First off paypal doesn’t take everything and keep it, other wise you wouldnt know about their existence. Duh…they have to advertise… Ive seen a tv commercial for paypal. Thats investment. Finish college maybe? hmm yea. pIf everyone was out for themselves then you know what, the terrorists win.<br>
Second, why dont you do the math because last time i check some bots out there are over $30 and have been sold a 2000+<br>
people quit rs that have like one account and half chub the game. Theres botters with 10+ accounts with memberships<br>
seriously brochacho…</p>
<p>People botch about so many botters last time i checked people quit because of the loss of wildy and free trade. Since the renewal of those online average only improved a tiny amount. Which i guess to be 75% more botters who are like THESE RETARDS… makin it to easy</p>
<p>Perhaps not jail but they would go under and lose most profits.<br>
Why else would they bring back free trade??? What benefit did that have?? All id did was give botters and real world traders even more of a reason to do it.</p>
<p>Plus its a free country and I can say wut ever da fuck i want <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> heres a conclusion:::::: its a conspiracy!<br>
[/quote]Are you really that dumb… paying for advertising is investing into your OWN company, not into other companies. In other words they’re still going for profit.</p>
<p>And what? How would jagex make them ‘go under’, except with something like this update (which you are saying is a conspiracy)</p>
<p>They brought back free trade because that’s what the players wanted, and it also brought in more money for themselves. They get more out of membership now, which doesn’t mean it was to support bots.</p>
<p>You’re right, it’s a free country. So I’m just going to say you’re dumb.</p>
<p>:)[/quote]</p>
<p>If you think this “update” is gunna make them go under then u gotta get ur head outta ur ass, idk who said it but, It only motivates scripters to do it all over again and show jagex up again…</p>
<p>Plus take an advertising class you might learn a thing or two… Where does the money given to the receiver go? Children in africa, children in america? wall street? the CEO’s slut wife’s boob job? Probably. But hell she needed them for her job, because she is a pornstar, And if you want me to get into the porn industry and their revenue it will hurt.</p>
<p>And its what the players wanted sure, botters are also players. When people realized how stupid the free trade was they quit and botters rose, there fore in the long run who really wins? botters or runescape try hards?</p>
<p>Don’t call me dumb :’( you might hurt my feelings because that’s a bad word <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>I love how people complain about the RUNESCAPE economy Fuck the RS ECO bro… For your information botters actually improve the “REAL WORLD” economy. Before botting there was no need for people to find and catch people cheating, which provided numerous jobs. What do botters do? They buy and sell gold on websites through playerauctions, paypal, money orders, bank transfers, which are all TAXED. That money goes to all your forsaken countries. Not to mention paypal, in specific, takes a little commission out of every transfer. That money is taken and invested into larger companies ect. Ill tell you something right now. I would not be surprised if Jagex was behind RSbot, and RSbuddy this whole time. Why? what if jagex proposed RSbuddy a deal and said hey, we wont put u in jail unless u give us 60% of your profits. People buy Jagex memberships just to bot with RSbuddys scripts. Its a win win. Honestly Who the fuck is winning? Its a Conspiracy i tell you.<br>
You heard it here first!</p>
