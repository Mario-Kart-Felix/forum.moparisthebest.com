    <title>PvN - NullPointerException</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pvn-nullpointerexception/275394</link>
    <description>Hello!

I have one problem that annoys the crap out of me and I can&#39;t solve it, I think I am missing something really obivous too!

Ok, I made a class(CombatCaller) that controls the packet(s) that have to do with combat.

So I got the packet 72, that is Attack NPC. Here is the code for it -

[code]	static void handleAttackNPC(Packet p, Player player, ActionSender sender) {
		int victim = p.readShortA();
		
		if (NPCManager.isValid(victim)) {
			Combat.attackNPC(victim, player);
		}
		
	}[/code]

The attackNPC packet ID is 72, which is what it is supposed to be.

Here is the attackNPC method in my CombatController,

[code]	public void attackNPC(int victim, Player player) { // Handles PVN.
		
		NPC n = NPCManager.getNPC(victim);
		
		if(n != null) {
			if (!NPCManager.isValid(victim)) {
				sender.sendMessage(&quot;You cannot attack this NPC.&quot;);
				return;
			}


			player.setAttackingNPC(n);

			sender.sendMessage(&quot;You attack a NPC with an ID of: &quot; + victim);
			player.setEntityFace(victim);

			if (n.isMoveable())
				n.setMoveable(false);
		}
	}[/code]

I do not see any problems with the code, however when I attack an NPC, I get a NullPointerException. The FIRST line that the error comes up is the line - Combat.attackNPC(victim, player);.

Please help me! I have no idea and this is delaying me from continuing with my combat!

Thanks a lot in advance!
