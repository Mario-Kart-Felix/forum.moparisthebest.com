    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/itunes-situation/117095</link>
    <description>What I want done:
    Get my neightbors songs from his iTunes onto my iTunes

He has a mac and I have a pc

Is it possible for him to put his songs ont oa dvd/flashdrive/whatever so it can be put onto my iTunes?  Ive heard from soem people that it can&#39;t be done but ive heard from others that it can, so idk.

I know I can easily get his songs onto my ipod, and plug that into my comp, but it wont let me put those songs from my ipod onto the itunes library, this is not what I want, i want it to always be on my itunes.

So anyone how if this can be done because we both like the same musi and I dont want to pay like $400 for songs whe nhe already has all of them.</description>

<p>And copypod allows you to rip songs off your iPod as if it were a CD.<br>

<p>Let him bring his iPod over and <em>upload</em> all his songs to your hard drive.<br>
(that would be uploading.  Not downloading :P)</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/exps35">@exps35</a>, I thought they made it so that you can’t access the songs though, so how would an mp3 converter work?  I could be wrong though, I haven’t tried.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/bang">@Bang</a> Train, what does copypod do?  take songs off of the ipod so they can be used with other programs?</p>

              <p>Well, If he has the mp3 files, you can put those directly onto any form of data transfer, and get those straight to your computer.</p>
<p>If they are iTunes format (or whatever the hell apple uses), then maybe put them through a media converter to mp3 format?</p>
<p>Just an idea.  Just start trying stuff out.  You’ll eventually come across something that works for you.</p>
