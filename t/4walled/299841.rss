&lt;blockquote&gt;If you&#39;re aware of the 4chan or 7chan imageboards then you would be aware they have a wallpapers board. The problem with these boards is they frequently clog with people posting the same wallpapers over and over again, so this site downloads all the wallpapers posted on the /w/, /wg/ and soon 7chans /wp/ boards. It then stores the image in a database ready for you to search.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;4walled uses a PHP script to parse and download all the images posted on the boards. It checks if that image is already in the database then if it isn&#39;t it inserts them into the database with all the information it could get from the board. If the information is limited then the image gets marked for needing tags, which is when it appears on the help site since you wont find those images searching the database.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
