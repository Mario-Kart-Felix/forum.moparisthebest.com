    <title>Help Removing Objects [PI] [SOLVED]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-removing-objects-pi-solved/478349</link>
    <description>The objects aren&#39;t in objectmanager so I don&#39;t know what to do. I searched their x/y&#39;s and their ID&#39;s, but I can&#39;t seem to find either in the client or source. Where would I go to remove them?  ---(It&#39;s a small obelisk and a grappling tree in my skilling area, came with the source.


EDIT: Solved, had to remove global objects.</description>
