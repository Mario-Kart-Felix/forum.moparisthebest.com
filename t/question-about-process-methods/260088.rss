    <title>Question about process methods</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-process-methods/260088</link>
    <description>Alright, I understand that the process methods (E.G. public boolean and void process) are called every 500 milliseconds if I am correct. 

My question is, is there anyway to make it be called slower? 
Like every 2,000 milliseconds or something?


If anyone could give me the method and where it actually determines when the method is called, that would be great.</description>

              <p>Well, I want to experiment a bit. Maybe calling the method less often will reduce a bit of lag, as clogging your process increases the lag of the server. Lag also depends on a lot of other resources, but I just want to experiment a bit with it.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
