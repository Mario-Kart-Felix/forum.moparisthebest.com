    <title>Award name ideas?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/award-name-ideas/423550</link>
    <description>Ok I have a short speech I am supposed to give in my public speaking class. I want to present an award to Steve Irwin(If we choose someone who has passed on we are supposed to act as they are still here. RIP Steve). I really don&#39;t know what I would name this award or exactly why I would be giving it. my teacher suggested giving it over his contributions to Australia and its citizens. There are quite a few things that could be addressed as an award.
p to him 
any SERIOUS, appropriate name ideas and topics are greatly appreciated.

I would like to do the speech over an award to Steve b/c I looked up to him when I was young. I always wanted to travel to Australia to meet him, I guess that won&#39;t be happening. :(</description>

              <p>It happens with all accents and stuff. I really dont have much of an accent. and when i went to disney world in florida, some locals asked where we were from and we said Indiana and they started talking in an deep red neck accent mockingly, which was quite offensive since no one in Indiana that I personally know has an accent like that. plus florida is the most southern state even though they dont have a southern accent.</p>

              <p>Ok I have a short speech I am supposed to give in my public speaking class. I want to present an award to Steve Irwin(If we choose someone who has passed on we are supposed to act as they are still here. RIP Steve). I really don’t know what I would name this award or exactly why I would be giving it. my teacher suggested giving it over his contributions to Australia and its citizens. There are quite a few things that could be addressed as an award.<br>
p to him<br>
any SERIOUS, appropriate name ideas and topics are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>I would like to do the speech over an award to Steve b/c I looked up to him when I was young. I always wanted to travel to Australia to meet him, I guess that won’t be happening. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
