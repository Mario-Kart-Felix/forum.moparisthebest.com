    <description>Hello, first off this is not Ric914&#39;s tutorial but it does have to do with it. I need serious help with it. I&#39;ve tried all types of clients to do this on and none of them work. I don&#39;t know if this is the right place to post this and I&#39;m sorry please don&#39;t yell. I just need a knowledgeable person to help me through the basics of my problem. I don&#39;t need mean people in here telling me what I did wrong I just want a web client :D
