    <description>Im currently in the making of a Interface Maker just have the basic stuff right now but may be able to be able to select different server/client versions and output the code accordingly, just an idea and was wondering if anyone might want me to release it.

<p>nobody is gonna force you to use this or any other “tool” / server etc.  on this site.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@op</span>. if it helps you,  use it. if you think it will help others, release it.<br>
just please, for the sake of all that is good, improve it. the ui is messy/limited. the code is ugly tbh…</p>
<p>also, if you plan to release it-be open source</p>

Yes, you do actually need feedback as you’re developing. So your end product doesn’t turn out like shit. Lol<br>
Because, as you can tell based on the responses already in the thread, your end product WILL turn out like shit.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m no where near the point of needing feedback everything that has been mentioned about fixing something is obvious fixes that would have been made i’m just setting a base right now once I actually get somewhere I’ll need feedback. I’m in the middle of banging my grandma the baby isn’t close to being developed I don’t need feedback</p>

<p>If you ask for our opinions on whether or not you should release it, you get both ends. You didn’t say “I only want <span class="bbcode-u">POSITIVE</span> opinions on this” or anything similar. Even if you did, that’d only make more backlash.<br>
