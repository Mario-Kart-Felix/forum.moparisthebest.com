<p>I would assume it wasn’t RuneTek 1, because they didn’t know it was going to be RuneTek 1 and it was just DeviousMUD, and then when RSC came it became RuneTek 1.</p>

[/quote]It was RuneTek 1, they just hadn’t created a name for their engine at the time, after switching the names from DeviousMUD to RuneScape, they decided on RuneTek 1. It was the same code, slightly worse, then RuneTek 1.[/quote]Do we really need to go over this again?</p>
