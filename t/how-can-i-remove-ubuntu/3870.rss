    <title>How can i remove ubuntu</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-can-i-remove-ubuntu/3870</link>
    <description>I accidentally installed ubuntu on my windows hard drive, at least I think...Im pretty new at this, just trying to get an idea of what its all about. Anyway, if not remove it at least get it out of the boot loader thingy, cause thats a bitch to select XP every time. I dont want to delete the partition either, i just spent about 5 hours downloading shit onto my new comp

On a side note, mabey someone could give me a little help? With the loader thingy if you select &quot;HD1&quot; as the boot, does that imply it will only have the option to boot when hard drive 2 is boot prioritised.

Sorry if its confusing, i&#39;m at lack of better experience and understanding. And dont say &quot;Linux isnt for you nob&quot; I just want to see what its all about.</description>
