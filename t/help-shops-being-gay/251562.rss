Help me![/quote]Wow, your sigs code is so shitty. If you aren’t going to use packages in it, which you probably aren’t since you don’t even know what it is, you don’t need an import, just a class declaration. The if statements are all wrong, there is no brackets, it doesn’t make sense, if statement’s don’t use a break statement, only switch statements do, and break is break; not ;break. None of the code is declared in a method, none of the integers are declared. Please remove your sig, it makes me rage how retarded one can be.</p>

              <p>So your shop is empty? Does it say something if you try to buy something if it isn’t empty?</p>
<p>And also your sig’s code makes no sense <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
