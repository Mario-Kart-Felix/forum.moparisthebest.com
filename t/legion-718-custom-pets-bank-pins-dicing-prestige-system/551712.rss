    <description>[center]Welcome to Legion,

Legion hasn&#39;t been around for that long at all, but the server has been reconstructed from other names before.
You may remember, ColdBrainScape, ClashPkz, etc. They are all improvements and/or conversions.

Legion tries their best to make sure everyone is satisfied with the server and all its features.

If you every have a problem/feedback/ or suggestion, the staff are always welcome to hearing them.


Features:

Fully working combat (so that everyone can enjoy the pvp and boss fights)
Over 20+ bosses so you can never run out of things to do!
Improvements DAILY, to keep things active and updated.
Friendly staff (but, behave because everyone has a structured side of them)
Clean cache (for personal purposes)
Donator system (with items!)
Plenty of training locations (to make sure you have all the needs you need)
Mini-games!! (once again, to keep you active)
PK Ranking system
Dicing (Only for donators)
Castle Wars 99% working (Ice barrage gets multiple targets)
PVP 100% Working!
A beautiful, wonderful home!
