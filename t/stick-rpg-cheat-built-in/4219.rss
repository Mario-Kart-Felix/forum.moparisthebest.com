    <title>Stick RPG Cheat (built in)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stick-rpg-cheat-built-in/4219</link>
    <description>Heres a cheat that helped me max out all my stats to 999 and get over 3m. When you start out enter your name as HEYZEUS!!!! and you will start out with 600 (I think) in all of your stats and 10000. That means you can get all of you promotions quick. Since I was maxxed out I also have a few more tips:

1. To become the dicator you need to have 777 in all stats, to be president you need 666. They both pay 5k a day.

2. Once you have played the game for 365 game days, you are rewarded with a sports car (Only if you have previously hotwired the other car).

3. To double your money INVEST INVEST INVEST in the stocks. Wait until they go down to 1 (as low as they go, you cannot lose money this way) and sell when they are around 2+, you have doubled your money :P

Well, thats all... Also there is a stick rpg2 demo on newgrounds... Pretty boring, but you get the idea of the fighting engine. Have fun.</description>

              <p>I found a new tip. Get a castle (I dont care how) and all the furniture (I Dont care how) and then make a scar script that keeps making you sleep. I got 999 in everything in under 10minutes. You can also get pretty much unlimited money if you put some in the ba\nk and keep sleeping…</p>

<p>For DICTATOR you MUST have: -100 Karma, 850+(on all stats), $200,000 and a castle."</p>
<p>Thats all you need to know. And the cheats are lame. I maxed out my character to over 25 billion, 99 in all stats, and president. It took me 2 and a half hours of constant playing.</p>
