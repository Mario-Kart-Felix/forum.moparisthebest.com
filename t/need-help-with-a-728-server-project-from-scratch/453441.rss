    <title>Need help with a 728 server project from scratch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-a-728-server-project-from-scratch/453441</link>
    <description>Hello all,

I&#39;m kinda new to the rsps coding scene, altough I already have alot of Java experience. I&#39;m planning on programming a 728 server from scratch. After looking in some of the popular sources, there are a few things that I don&#39;t really understand yet of the RS network protocol (encoding, decoding etc). I hope there is someone here that can help me with some problems I&#39;m facing about setting up the very, very base of a 728 server via Skype.

Add me, Masterleik, or send me a PM. It would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
