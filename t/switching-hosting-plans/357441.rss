    <description>Well on my server i have listed on the server status page goes by my old ip-address from our old vps and i have tried everything to get it to switch to the new ip that we got from the new vps company but i can&#39;t seem to find a way to do that. 

We have worked very hard to keep 94% uptime for over a year and we are on the first page with a good amount of votes and i would like not having to start over because we are one of the very few most popular servers that still are running since 2009. So if you could please tell me how to switch over the ip-address&#39;s?

I posted this in general questions but its been like 4 days and no answer and i have sent it to a couple admins as well with no reply, this is really urgent.</description>

<p>Kid just stop i politely waited for over 4 days and no answer and than i messaged to several admins politely asking them for an answer but with no reply. This is very urgent as it will hurt our server status very bad. The general questions dosent seem to get a lot of viewers so i decied it to post here. So just get off me.</p>
