    <description>Well on my server i have listed on the server status page goes by my old ip-address from our old vps and i have tried everything to get it to switch to the new ip that we got from the new vps company but i can&#39;t seem to find a way to do that. 

We have worked very hard to keep 94% uptime for over a year and we are on the first page with a good amount of votes and i would like not having to start over because we are one of the very few most popular servers that still are running since 2009. So if you could please tell me how to switch over the ip-address&#39;s?</description>
