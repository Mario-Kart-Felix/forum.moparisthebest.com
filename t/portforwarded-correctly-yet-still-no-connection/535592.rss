    <title>Portforwarded Correctly, Yet still no connection?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarded-correctly-yet-still-no-connection/535592</link>
    <description>Hey,

I&#39;ve recently just tried to upload my own server so i can play with close friends online. I&#39;ve portforwarded, made a no-ip and what not. I&#39;ve checked that my port is open using software that i&#39;ve previously used (when i last put a server online). I&#39;ve checked using the Runelocus server status checker and it does actually say that my server is ONLINE and PLAYABLE on port 43594. However, nobody seems to be able to connect?

I know it must be very frustrating having to help people like me, yet i&#39;ve tried for hours on end, searched a lot of forum posts and have still no idea what the problem may be! if anyone could help i&#39;d be very thankful.

You can also contact me on skype if makes life easier for you, simply PM me for my address. 

Thanks a lot!</description>

              <p>Did you change the port client sided? Also some severs require a specific client to connect</p>
