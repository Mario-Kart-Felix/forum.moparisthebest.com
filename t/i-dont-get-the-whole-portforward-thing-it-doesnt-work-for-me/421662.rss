    <description>Uhm, so its like this I&#39;m following a pretty good rsps tut then when it comes to the part when they tell you to get utorrent and to type in the port thing (43594) and they say there should be 2 ticks but for me its only one and it says it failed the &quot;speed&quot; test or whatever that is and then when I open my client then I put in the port (43594) and the ip from hamachi and it says error connecting so I try the ip 127.0.0.1 because they say if you put that it won&#39;t be online so it&#39;s only you playing so i went and did that then the same thing happened, always errors D:.

any clue on what happening??  :confused: :confused: :confused:  :(</description>
