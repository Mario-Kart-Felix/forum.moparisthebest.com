    <title>Webclient help or tut or something please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-help-or-tut-or-something-please/235629</link>
    <description> I have no clue where to start but my players have all requested a web client as I am getting dedicated soon so umm I need help like maybe a tutorial or something but I need to make a webclient identical to my normal client cos my normal client supports all my customs and stuff so someone please help?If you want I can give mod on forums or server for the help =].


 NOTE: I am not asking someone to do this for me I am just nice enough to give staff for great help so please don&#39;t flame me guys.

Thanks,
Mudvayne
