    <title>Make me some paint art?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-me-some-paint-art/162605</link>
    <description>Could someone do me a picture of truley adding safe zones.. It&#39;s really making me confused when people says:

First X = South-East
2ND X = North-East
First Y = South-East
2ND Y = North-East

To me that makes same cords for first x and first y just that you use the x/y cords.. really.. REALLY confusing to me  :confused:



Cheers, Wheaties.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Infernal, post:2, topic:162605”]Now try to follow this image<br>
<img src="http://i241.photobucket.com/albums/ff260/Devianz/Tut.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>X1 To X2 Will make the diagonal from Bottom Right to Top Left<br>
Y1 To Y2 Will make the diagonal from Bottom Left to Top Right</p>
<p>These Create the square that your NPC will be walking, without always making the same course, he will walk randomly but always inside that square.<br>
Remember to always mark the territory you want him to walk on:<br>
First comes X1 - The Bottom Right Piece of the area<br>
Them Comes X2 - The Top Left Part of the Area<br>
After Comes Y1 - The Bottom Left part of the Area<br>
After Comes Y2 - The Top Right part of the area.<br>
Now, you have a fully created area ( A square in this tut ) that the NPC will be walking in!<br>
This was made by me on my old acc, hope it helped ya[/quote]<br>
IM CONFUZELD!</p>
