    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-file-has-the-list-of-commands-in-it/229840</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t played in a while, I have an old source, I was trying to figure out what the old command is that admin&#39;s used to get max stats...

So which file has the list of commands?
Doesn&#39;t show from ::commands ingame</description>
