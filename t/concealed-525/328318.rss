The Concealed 525 Main Project

Introduction:
Hello there, I am Jcc_jcat, the server head and head programmer in the Concealed RSPS Server Series Group. Our most pride filled server, the 525, is a server that has been worked on since August of 2009. We have started off as a simple 525 server based of RuneScorp, a pretty happy server. It then came to me that all 525&#39;s ever had was PVP, so the first update I added to my first 525 was my woodcutting base, then my firemaking, then mining. I know they weren&#39;t the best but working for the past months, I have improved my Java skills and I know that this server will be a success.
This server is based off the Rs2Hd Release by Luke. I have a converted RS2HD 276 with most packets converted, but I didn&#39;t feel completely satisfied. There was a lot more content in the 276 and I wasn&#39;t completely familiar with all of them. So I stuck with Luke Release (&lt;3 it by the way, I thank you so much ^_^). I started with adding the NPC Update Masks (thanks Mage_Owner) because I&#39;ve always wanted to be one of the first people with NPC Combat on a 525 (Damnit Pie &amp; Origin &lt;3). Its always been my intention to do a perfect combat system so I can work with all the skilling and other features. Well, as a quick solution to quick combat, 2 words, Entity Combat. My combat system was written completely from scratch using events and Entity. One class, 2 Fields: EntityCombat(e1, e2);. 
Ok, I can tell half of you are already bored with this thread so lets start with our features now shall we.

-Private Messaging-
I am having some errors with it so I can&#39;t really say its full (Pming isn&#39;t working atm &gt;.&lt;)

Shopping

-Jc Script-
Its similar to the irc RuneScript bot, Just use the ! and a command and watch it roll. When a basic GE system is built, you can grab the current prices and use the merch tools like the !calc command. I wanted to import a basic IRC Client into the server, but I thought it was too much. Hell, if people  want it, I&#39;ll add it ^_^, I&#39;ll be fun.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Out of 100% boredom, I wrote a server gui (control panel) for the Concealed 525 project.

This is the server connection settings for IRC. More Info below
[IMG]http://theconcealed.co.cc/Project Thread/GUI4.png[/img]
The Player List to the right supports (or will support, I forgot to make it show the data) players listed in this format: Index - Name - World (1 or 2) - Rights
[IMG]http://theconcealed.co.cc/Project Thread/GUI5.png[/img]
The Range button can be toggled on or off to support the NPC walking. The NPC spawned here are not saved to the NPC.xml but instead , their details are printed into a pending.txt file where we can grab it if we want it. It also spawns the NPC in the server.  I will be adding an Object Adding System Later
[IMG]http://theconcealed.co.cc/Project Thread/GUI6.png[/img]
Didn&#39;t Like the normal Command Prompt look so I hid that windows and all the data gets printed here. The Restart Server will close the GameEngine and recall the main method. Useful if the server crashes and i don&#39;t feel like navigating to the server folder. Serber destruct just closes the engine.
[IMG]http://theconcealed.co.cc/Project Thread/IRCSystem.png[/img]
Really not that hard. Its an IRC Bot that will respond to certain commands and will state when the GE updates (when we implement) when a certain player has completed a quest, when a certain player has killed a boss, when a certain player get their ass kicked by a boss, and when a player gets punishehed via muting or banning.

Criticisms are welcome, flaming isn&#39;t.
I know it isn&#39;t much but hey, a lot of people don&#39;t do or can&#39;t do it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
-------------------
ENTITY COMBAT SYSTEM:
Supports all three combat Systems:

Player vs Player
Npc vs Npc
Player vs Npc 
[IMG]http://theconcealed.co.cc/Project%20Thread/PvN.png[/img]
What I started was making the NPC class abstract inorder to separate a normal NPC  and a familiar (you are technically playing this &quot;NPC&quot;) Inorder to make life easier but it was too much for too little. Well  here are my combat features right now.

-Retaliation Support ( Auto for NPCs, Players have the button)
-Summoning Combat Support
[IMG]http://theconcealed.co.cc/Project%20Thread/NVN.png[/img]
(Graardor was my familiar in this case, and holy ****, did he just max :o)
[IMG]http://theconcealed.co.cc/Project%20Thread/PVPwSumm.png[/img]

Well, thats it for now ^_^
