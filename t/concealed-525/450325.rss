    <description>[CENTER][IMG]http://initiateid.com/concealed/content/Concealed525.jpg[/img][/CENTER]


Back story:
I guess I can say I came back from the dead in the private server world. So I didn&#39;t have internet for awhile, and I decided to clean out my external hard drive, and I found some old RSPS stuff like 525 packets and other documentation that I wrote, and so I was like... okay! I&#39;ll rid my internet-less boredom by making a Runescape Private Server. So I went to the public library, played some Runescape, and was like... yeah... the older days were better, and I already had my 525 information, so I&#39;ll just make a 525 for now... I could always update the revision later if I wanted to...

Server Information:
So if you didn&#39;t feel like reading the back story, I&#39;m making a 525 server, from a base RS2HD Server. I am a bit rusty with Runescape Private Servers since the last time I touched them was like... a year and a half ago? Anyway, I guess I could update this later.

Goals:
Make and host a decent 525 server with a nice balance between skilling, Player vs NPC, Mini Games, and PvP.

And... finally the project stuff:

UPDATE: I was originally using Luke132&#39;s RS2HD Base, however, I decided to switch to a Standard RS2HD 508 Revision 276. I found it would be easier to start with a higher revision of the base, since I am a bit more familiar with the class names of the 276 RS2HD.

Project Log:

7/19/2012
Downloaded RS2HD Revision 276
Started the Conversion!
	-6:50PM Updated the entire Login Block
	-6:56PM A lot of complaining from Apache MINA about no-args constructors, went and fixed it all.
	7:01PM - Login Block works!
        [IMG]http://initiateid.com/concealed/content/content1.jpg[/img]
	7:21PM - World List Data Sends!
	[IMG]http://initiateid.com/concealed/content/content2.jpg[/img]
	7:25PM - Went to Dinner
	7:59PM - Commented out all of the Ougoing Packets for 508/ Added Map Region Packets and Overlay
Added some outgoing packets:
	sendFriendsStatus
	sendSentPrivateMessage
	sendReceivedPrivateMessage
	sendFriend
	sendIgnores
	sendBlankClientScript
	setRightClickOptions
	sendMapVisibility
	sendCreateObject
	sendDestroyObject
	sendNPCHead
	sendPlayerHead
	sendItem
	animateInterface
	sendScreenShake
	sendConfig1
	sendConfig2
	sendProjectile
	sendCoords
	sendInterface
Added the Player and NPC Masks!
RS2HD Successfully converted to 525!
[IMG]http://initiateid.com/concealed/content/content3.jpg[/img]
7/20/2012
Added most of the incoming packets…
Okay, so now it has been converted to 525
Filled in the RS2HD 508 outgoing packets with the 525.
I only missed: sendShopLoadMainStock, sendShopOptions, sendSystemUpdate

Features enabled by upgrading streams, frames, packets, etc.

Truly added all Player Masks, tested all that!
Repaired an Issue with 508 packets that kept getting sent from mysterious locations

7/21/2012
Kinda added a custom outgoing server packet, kinda useless until I can find the client outgoing packets. (Took forever to find on the HD Client &gt;.&lt;)

7/24/2012
Added working  Welcome Screen!
Started on the IRC Bot!
Added a few more useful developer commands
Changed the spawn point to Varrock.
Improved some of the HD Resizable code, still has quite a bit to go.
[IMG]http://initiateid.com/concealed/content/content4.jpg[/img]
7/25/2012
Fixed Pming system!
Made more fixes to the HD Resizable system.
7/26/2012
-Added custom special bar system. Special Bar reads Special Attack Energy. It will be green if you can perform a special attack, and red if you can&#39;t. Why did I do this? Because the special bar config isn&#39;t working for some reason. I actually like this system a bit better.
-Couple more HD Resizable Fixes
-Added a few custom sprites to the cache, meaning that our client must be used to play.
-Added an ogg player to client, might use for character voice overs.
7/27/2012

-Added Summoning Base



My Setup:

The Host Server:
[IMG]http://initiateid.com/concealed/content/IServ.jpg[/img]

The Test Computer:
[IMG]http://initiateid.com/concealed/content/ITest.jpg[/img]

The World List Host Server:
-At the shop...-


Internet Speed:
-I just got my internet restored, and they are working on reactivated my Speed Boost Service. I&#39;ll post my Speed Test results later.

I also have a UPS... but the battery is like so bad ( &lt; 5 Minutes) that I&#39;ll probably be replacing it soon.

Credits:
Source:
Graham and Luke132 for the RS2HD Base.

Client:
Jagex
Whoever modified the client to work with RSPS&#39;s?


Staff:
Me - The only programmer... for now.
Initiate id - My programming team... although so far, no one is helping me with the actual, they help maintain the website, sql server, and the other servers

              <p>My epic lack of mapdata is really hindering the potential of the project, so I may be changing the client revision or have it load a different cache. Opinions?</p>
<p>Latest Updates:<br>
-Added Skill Cape Masters with alternate dialogues for people without level 99<br>
-Based the entire server around Varrock due to lack of mapdata and to ensure no one loses their account because of mapdata related crashes.<br>
-More Changes to HD.</p>
