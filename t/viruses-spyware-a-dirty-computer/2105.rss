    <description>[center][b][size=20pt]Viruses? Spyware? A DIRTY COMPUTER?[/size][/b]
by Ron[/center]

Hey everyone. I have noticed a lot of people talking about technical problems, too many things on your computer, blah blah blah and much more. I have devised the perfect steps and programs to fix your computer&#39;s problems. Don&#39;t tune out just yet, this is a very useful guide made by another jerk... like me.

[b]-&gt; The Beginning Steps[/b]
[ul][*]The first thing you should do, is go through your list of installed programs. Click on the Start Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Add or Remove Programs. Now, look through the list and get rid of everything that you don&#39;t want anymore (provided you get your parents permission unless you have your own computer). Do NOT remove programs you know absolutely nothing about, because they could be Microsoft Updates or something just as critical.
[*] The next thing you should do is go to where all the crud left behind will probably be from the installed programs. Go to My Computer &gt; Local Disk (C: ) &gt; Program Files.  Now look through the folders names and see if any of those names were the same names you removed from the Add or Remove Programs and if nothing but that particular program you uninstalled was in it... then delete it.[/ul]


[b]-&gt; Disk Cleanup &amp; Disk Defragmenter[/b]
One last thing you should do without the aid of programs is to do these things (again, provided you get your parents permission unless you have your own computer).

[ul][*] Start menu &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup (this will take a while, Do NOT run anything else, go to a website, or anything. Just leave it alone.
[*] After that is completed, you may defrag your computer now. Start menu &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Defragmenter. Again, this will take a while, Do NOT run anything else, go to a website, or anything. Just leave it alone.[/ul]


[b]-&gt; Turn off Hibernation to Save GBs of data![/b]
Hibernation is a tool that most people who have Microsoft don&#39;t even use it. Hibernation saves a lot of energy on your computer when it&#39;s idle, but it stores a lot of data on your hard drive. The file is called Hiberfil.sys and it&#39;s in your C:\ Drive right in the beginning. Right click on it and select properties and you will see how much space it takes up. Took about 1 GB of space before I disabled it.

Follow these steps to disable it safely.

[ul][*] Right-click on the desktop and click on &quot;Properties&quot;.
[*] Click on the &quot;Screen Saver&quot; tab.
[*] Click the &quot;Power&quot; button under &quot;Monitor Power&quot;.
[*] Click on the &quot;Hibernation&quot; tab, then uncheck the box next to &quot;Enable Hibernation&quot;.
[*] Press &quot;OK&quot; and you have just saved a load of hard drive space![/ul]

Check out these programs. I have them all, and my computer is clean except for that crap installed on it (called Microsoft). Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s safe to havemore than one anti spyware running on yoru computer. People will tell you all kinds of bullshit on how they conflict with one another, but they don&#39;t, so don&#39;t worry. :)

[b]-&gt; Good Programs[/b]

[b]What to do:[/b] 
[ul][*] Update it. 
[*] Go through each category on the left side and do every scan! 
[*] Fix all the issues and once you have finished all the scans, your computer will be spic and span![/ul]


[b]Program:[/b] Crap Cleaner - [url=http://www.ccleaner.com]Home Site[/url]
[b]Download:[/b] [url=http://www.filehippo.com/download_ccleaner/]Link[/url]
[b]What to do:[/b] 

[ul][*] Click on Cleaner after you have opened the program and make sure everything is checked except for Advanced options in the category &quot;Windows&quot; and all of them should be checked in the category &quot;Applications&quot;.
[*] Click on Analyze, just to see how much crap you have. Then click on Run Cleaner to get that junk off your computer. 
[*] Click on Issues. EVERYTHING should be checked, and now click on Scan for Issues.
[*] Click on Fix Selected Issues and MAKE SURE YOU SAVE IT THE FIRST TIME. It will come up in a pop-up asking if you would like to back those registry entries up just as a precaution.[/ul]


[b]Program:[/b] Registry Mechanic - [url=http://www.pctools.com/registry-mechanic/]Home Site[/url]
[b]Download:[/b] Download this from [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,1266.0.html]this[/url] thread. Otherwise you have to pay for this program lol.
[b]What to do:[/b] 

[ul][*] Click on Optimize your System which is a big button right in front.
[*] Click on Options and make sure that it creates a system restore point before repair. Uncheck that box after you have run and repaired registry entries for the first time if you like.
[*] Click on Options &gt; Custom Scan and make sure everything is checked and then save it.
[*] Run the scan by clicking on Scan Your Registry and repair everything. Make sure it makes a backup.
[*] Now go back to Status and click on Compact registry to improve speed on your computer.[/ul]


[b]Program:[/b] Spybot - [url=http://www.safer-networking.org/]Home Site[/url]
[b]Download:[/b] [url=http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-Destroy/3000-8022_4-10401314.html?tag=pop]Link[/url]
[b]What to do:[/b]

[ul][*] Update it and download all the updates.
[*] Immunize and then immunize again, but this time click on Immunize button next to the Check Again button to make sure it has been fully immunized.
[*] Run it.
[*] Bring up TeaTimer.exe by clicking on Mode at the top and selecting Advanced Mode. Then click on Tools &gt; Resident &gt; Check both Resident &quot;SDHelper&quot; and Resident &quot;TeaTimer&quot;. If TeaTimer ever comes up, that means someone or you are trying to make a registry change. If you are installing something or changing settings, just click on Allow but if you aren&#39;t changing anything, click on Deny. There is a bug with TeaTimer, and you can&#39;t see the buttons on it except for a small piece. Just remember, Allow is on the left and Deny is on the right.
[*] Spybot (TeaTimer) should be running on the bottom right of your computer.
[*] Note: Spybot has a small problem with the TeaTimer and I don&#39;t know why, but they never fixed it. So if you do install Spybot and have TeaTimer running, please check out this guide, so you can fix that small bug. Apparently when a registry entry is changed, TeaTimer will come up if you want it to either Accept or Deny this registry change. If you don&#39;t fix this bug, then you won&#39;t be able to see those 2 buttons and will not be able to accept any changes. If you&#39;re installing something, the install won&#39;t work properly. Please, go view the guide. [url=http://forums.spybot.info/showthread.php?t=122]Link to Guide[/url]
[*] Also, go to Tools &gt; System Startup and each one of those files are automatically started once you restart your computer. Read the information on each one and disable the ones you don&#39;t need. Uncheck all the ones that are Highlighted in Red. Those are spyware. If there isn&#39;t any information about that process, then simply leave it the way it is.[/ul]


[b]Program:[/b] SpySweeper - [url=http://www.webroot.com]Home Site[/url]

[b]IE Fans:[/b] Internet Explorer SUCKS! It has the most vulnerabilities, every time a new viral infection is out, it most likely (99.999999% of the time) hits Internet Explorer only. Get Firefox. It&#39;s free, fast, secure, better, and it&#39;s the best! Don&#39;t believe me? [url=http://goons.freepgs.com/stuff.php?p=Mozilla_Firefox_vs_Internet_Explorer]Then look at this[/url].
[b]Program:[/b] Mozilla&#39;s Firefox - [url=http://www.mozilla.com]Home Site[/url]
[b]Download:[/b] [url=http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/]Link[/url]
[b]What to do:[/b] 

[ul][*] It&#39;s better than Internet Explorer in so many ways, and I can&#39;t sit here and type them all up. Just install it, to see why it&#39;s so much better. 
[*] You can customize the buttons, search engines are built in, bookmarks are much easier to use, much more secure, able to add modifications exclusively from Mozilla.org to make Firefox even better!
[*] Tabbed browsing, and soo many More features and it&#39;s very VERY easy to setup.[/ul]


[b]Program:[/b] FreeRAM XP Pro - [url=http://www.yourwaresolutions.com/]Home Site[/url] (Thank you Kurt and BlackThursday)
[b]Download:[/b] [url=http://www.download.com/FreeRAM-XP-Pro/3000-2086_4-10516960.html?tag=pdp_prod]Link[/url]

[b]Program:[/b] HijackThis - [url=http://www.spywareinfo.com/~merijn/]Home Site[/url] - Thanks inholtz
[b]Download:[/b] [url=http://www.majorgeeks.com/download3155.html]Link[/url]
[b]What to do:[/b]

[ul][*] Download HijackThis and extract it to your desktop.
[*] Open it and click on &quot;Do a system scan and save a logfile&quot; and save the logfile also to your desktop.
[*] Look over your logfile, if you&#39;re afraid to do anything, ask for help.
[*] Post the logfile here even if you think nothing is wrong with it. You never know, someone hear could find a problem.
[*] There are more features of HijackThis, but I wouldn&#39;t try them, since they may prove fatal to your computer. Just stick with the basics...for now. :)[/ul]


[b]-&gt; Notes on the Good Programs[/b]
Having anti-spyware programs is great but running them once in a [i]lifetime[/i] is NOT GOOD! You must run these scans regularly, just in case of that slight (huge) chance of your computer getting infected. You don&#39;t want to lose your game accounts, Credit Card Numbers (don&#39;t even put that on your computer), E-Mails, Personal Chats, Website Information, Things you could get Black Mailed for... ANY information stolen off your computer could be useful to someone else. Try to run these programs just before you go to bed, right before you go to school, or even right before you go out and do anything. Just make sure you run them!

[b]-&gt; Saved Passwords and Forms[/b]
If you guys save passwords or form information for searches and stuff... DO NOT! You must turn them off immediately or any hacker on your computer could easily get access to them. 
[b]Turn it off for IE:[/b] Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Content &gt; AutoComplete &gt; Uncheck everything and click on Clear Forms and Clear Passwords.
[b]To turn it off for Firefox:[/b] Tools &gt; Options &gt; Privacy &gt; Saved Form Information &gt; Uncheck Save Information I enter in web page forms and the Search Bar. Also in the Privacy Panel (where Saved Form Information is), click on Saved Passwords and uncheck Remember Passwords. 

[b]-&gt; Remember[/b]
Spyware/Viruses could do anything. They could key log your strokes, they could delete your files, they could keep restarting your computer each time it loads Windows, and yes they can even cause freeze ups. They can do ANYTHING! Especially to Microsoft Users. I wish I had Linux or a Mac. They have only about 10 or 12 holes where as Microsoft has 55 or more.

[b]-&gt; Free Online Scans[/b]
If you want to do some online scans or port scans or any other kind of those scans to see if your computer has any vulnerabilities or if your Anti-Spyware software and/or firewall has been compromised, then try some of these free scans. Also, each port scan in the below, are different from one another. I know I know, why can&#39;t they just have one scan that scans everything...but sadly they don&#39;t, and you need to use your Internet Explorer for the below scans because everyone is prejudiced against anything different (better).

[ul][*] [url=https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2]Shields Up[/url] - Has many scans for you to choose from. File Sharing Scan, Common Ports Scan, All Service Ports Scan, Messenger Spam Scan, and Browser Headers Scan. Excellent!
[*] [url=http://scan.sygate.com/]Sygate[/url] - Long Port Scan, but very very good!
[*] [url=http://onlinecheck.emsisoft.com/en/]A-Squared[/url] - Port Scan, Security Test, Exploit Test, and Browser Check scans.
[*] [url=http://virusscan.jotti.org/]Jotti&#39;s Virus Scan[/url] - Upload a malicious file you think is corrupted, and Jotti will scan it for you.[/ul]

.

[b]-&gt; What you should do anyways[/b]

[ul][*] Stay away from websites with possible spyware/viruses such as hacker sites, pornographic sites, and downloading anything illegal.
[*] Definitely stay away from programs such as Limewire, Kazaa, and don&#39;t give me bull by saying &quot;That program doesn&#39;t have any viruses&quot; bull bull.. and more bull. The program may not, but you are downloading from individual people.
[*] Watch out for weird looking links from people on your buddy list. Some of my friends used to have many AIM/MSN viruses, and the virus would actually IM each person on the buddy list and send them a link. It might be a picture, program, flash file, ANYTHING, and it may give you a virus. Just make sure it&#39;s not.[/ul]


[b]-&gt; Last Notes on Security[/b]
To be very secure, you NEED a firewall. I have a modem firewall, a router firewall, a hardware firewall, Norton 2006 firewall, A-Squared Background Guard, Ewido, SpySweeper, and the Spybot (TeaTimer). NOTHING gets in my computer. If you want to be secure, you got to go above and beyond. And yes I am paranoid, and a little nuts lol, but that&#39;s okay. And to be perfectly secure, you need to take your computer (if its running windows) and throw it straight out the window, lol.

Now I hope you are as secure as me and now have a clean computer as well. :D

<p>Rofl. Ron, not enough firewalls running. You’ve obviously got about 2k viruses from lack of firewall <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Naw. My computer is almost as fast as an nLite fresh install of XP. When the comp first boots up, only 165K ram used up and 15 or 16 processes. I forget.</p>
<p>This tutorial is old and I have grown a little annoyed with the other apps I used. I finally got rid of my previous firewall, Norton, which sucks! And started to use Kaspersky! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> One firewall is perfect for me now. Plus a very nice FiOS hardware firewall from Verizon.</p>

              <p>Thank you inholtz. I added HijackThis to the programs list and added information on it.</p>
<p>I also added a guide to fixing that spybot issue that everyone was affected by if they used TeaTimer. I also added my hijackthis.log. I had to change the name and extension since Mopar hasn’t enabled .log files to be uploaded yet.</p>
<p>My apologies. Here is the <a href="http://forums.spybot.info/showthread.php?t=122" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Link to Guide</a> on fixing the bug. More info on the bug in the Spybot category on the main page of this tutorial.</p>

              <p>By the way Ron… This tutorial by you is almost perfect… But I wanna try to help you make it even better… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> I know one more REALLY good program. I’ve been using this program 2 years now, and I am proud with it. Its a privacy shield, what it does, well… It tells if some program is trying to read screen or keyboard (and probably even log) so, you can block it or allow. Its really good product and its free, yes, FREE.</p>
<p>Check it out… Here is the link. <a href="http://www.snoopfree.com/PrivacyShield.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.snoopfree.com/PrivacyShield.htm</a></p>
<p>I think just everyone should use it… Its good and also its a very big PLUS (+) for making computer safe to use. Try it and if you think its a good product, then you better add it to list <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
