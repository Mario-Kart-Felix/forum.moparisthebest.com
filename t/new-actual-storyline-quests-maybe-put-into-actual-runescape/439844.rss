    <title>New actual storyline quests-maybe put into actual runescape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-actual-storyline-quests-maybe-put-into-actual-runescape/439844</link>
    <description>hello, everyone this is a great deal project a new line of story quests that can fill in voids in the runescape line.
before i begin, i would like to know if any great coders, gfx designers, animation, models and other java material coders are willing to help
as there will be no money involved, unless if of  course we maybe present the finished product to jagex, as u guys the coders might well could land a job on the design team, it could be a great possibilty. as i&#39;m not a great coder i&#39;m new to everything i&#39;m mostly an idea man

**now back to the quest, these series of quests are going to be like no other, not those so called quests on other rsps. these will be hand written and coded using &quot;my&quot; own ideas and creativity in creating custom people, fights, items etc.
there will be a maybe 2 or three quests leading up to a major ques, that is far more difficult than anything in runescape, but theres a twist there will be someone that can help you. but no one will be able to find  out unless this story line can possibly fill in the void in the runescape background

if any one would like to be a part of this major production, which can possibly take many days,weeks or months to finish

add me on msn: d3athbyn1ght@hotmail.com 
add me on skype: d3athsboss

i hope this can be well created i don&#39;t want ideas and a major role in everyones runescape related background
 using a 700+ source most likely as it is most up to date with runescape at the moment</description>
