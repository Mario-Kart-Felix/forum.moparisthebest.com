    <title>New actual storyline quests-maybe put into actual runescape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-actual-storyline-quests-maybe-put-into-actual-runescape/439818</link>
    <description>hello, everyone this is a great deal project a new line of story quests that can fill in voids in the runescape line.
before i begin, i would like to know if any great coders, gfx designers, animation, models and other java material coders are willing to help
as there will be no money involved, unless if of  course we maybe present the finished product to jagex, as u guys the coders might well could land a job on the design team, it could be a great possibilty. as i&#39;m not a great coder i&#39;m new to everything i&#39;m mostly an idea man

**now back to the quest, these series of quests are going to be like no other, not those so called quests on other rsps. these will be hand written and coded using &quot;my&quot; own ideas and creativity in creating custom people, fights, items etc.
there will be a maybe 2 or three quests leading up to a major ques, that is far more difficult than anything in runescape, but theres a twist there will be someone that can help you. but no one will be able to find  out unless this story line can possibly fill in the void in the runescape background

if any one would like to be a part of this major production, which can possibly take many days,weeks or months to finish

add me on msn: d3athbyn1ght@hotmail.com 
add me on skype: d3athsboss

i hope this can be well created i don&#39;t want ideas and a major role in everyones runescape related background</description>

<p>And i very well can talk to my peers, as i wan’t to learn java as a side thing. My main goals are actually to make money in life and not spend all my time coding games, that are made copies of the original. 100% wouldn’t know squat shit in how to start from scratch.<br>
i’m not like the rest of this community who actually take java scripting classes. no i focus on main goals in life, like doing something useful, like going to college for med. school what, are you going to do sit here and try to be a mocking troll of others?[/quote]<br>

              <p>[quote=“d3athbyn1ght, post:3, topic:439843”]uhmm i actually have an understanding of the language as you see there were no grammatical errors<br>
so before you do anything actually look, your not very smart i presume.</p>
<p>And i very well can talk to my peers, as i wan’t to learn java as a side thing. My main goals are actually to make money in life and not spend all my time coding games, that are made copies of the original. 100% wouldn’t know squat shit in how to start from scratch.<br>
i’m not like the rest of this community who actually take java scripting classes. no i focus on main goals in life, like doing something useful, like going to college for med. school what, are you going to do sit here and try to be a mocking troll of others?[/quote]</p>
<p>Mate, I don’t even have to say anything. There is nothing I could say that could insult you further than you insult yourself.</p>

i’m willing to learn also, i don’t want to sit their and do nothing that doesn’t benefit me at all…<br>
maybe there are people who can help me get a better understanding of the java code[/quote]</p>
<p>I’d start with a better understanding of the English language. How are you ever supposed to convey ideas to your peers when you can’t even communicate with them? Of course you are going to get mocked, you sound like a fucking moron. Go back to primary school.</p>

              <p>hello, everyone this is a great deal project a new line of story quests that can fill in voids in the runescape line.<br>
before i begin, i would like to know if any great coders, gfx designers, animation, models and other java material coders are willing to help<br>
as there will be no money involved, unless if of  course we maybe present the finished product to jagex, as u guys the coders might well could land a job on the design team, it could be a great possibilty. as i’m not a great coder i’m new to everything i’m mostly an idea man</p>
<p>**now back to the quest, these series of quests are going to be like no other, not those so called quests on other rsps. these will be hand written and coded using “my” own ideas and creativity in creating custom people, fights, items etc.<br>
there will be a maybe 2 or three quests leading up to a major ques, that is far more difficult than anything in runescape, but theres a twist there will be someone that can help you. but no one will be able to find  out unless this story line can possibly fill in the void in the runescape background</p>
<p>if any one would like to be a part of this major production, which can possibly take many days,weeks or months to finish</p>
<p>add me on msn: <a href="mailto:d3athbyn1ght@hotmail.com">d3athbyn1ght@hotmail.com</a><br>
add me on skype: d3athsboss</p>
<p>i hope this can be well created i don’t want ideas and a major role in everyones runescape related background</p>
