    <description>Ok, first off, I don&#39;t know what to do here (read the picture)

[img]http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/9540/systemerrorpa2.jpg[/img]
And next off, I would like to ask about compiling/decompiling:

Now a program I found off this site to decompile .jar files, so that you will be able to get the .class files. 
And even there, it was able to make them turn into a &quot;.jad&quot; file. Now, my question is this (questions).

1. To recompile them back into the .jar file of moparscape, do I keep them as a &quot;.jad&quot; or do I half to turn them into a &quot;.class&quot; file.
2. If 1 is right about .class, how do I change it back into a  &quot;.class&quot; WITHOUT a &quot;.bat&quot; file (since it dosen&#39;t want to work.) 
3. Relation to number 2, are there any programs I can download (not big in memory, Dial up I have. So yea.) And where could I find any at?
4. Is it really true that compiling is as easy as extracting files, editing them and putting them back in the .jar file? ([b]NOTE[/B]:IM NEW AT JAVA )


All reguards of not flaming, calling me noob(cause I already know this, you don&#39;t half to waste 2 hours trying to look at your keyboard to find a few letters to &quot;internet talk&quot; to me by flaming)

ps: I am about to make a tutorial once I figure out these things, ONE THAT IS COMMON SCENE! one that literally goes though the steps (maybe even by pictures!) that will blow out everything and can help everyone, and will lower the amount of questions that makes people that knows the answeres already mad. 

(And if you notice, I think I have a pretty well out grammar here XD no guys, I&#39;m sorry. But some people here... Yea. GET FIREFOX IF YOU CAN&#39;T SPELL. Yes, I can&#39;t spell either all that greatly for big words, so use that.)</description>
