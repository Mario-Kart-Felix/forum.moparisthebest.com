    <title>RV6 High Performance J-Pipe Installation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rv6-high-performance-j-pipe-installation/442877</link>
    <description>Not really hanging around these forums anymore but if anyone is interested I have swapped the JPipe on my 2005 Acura RL to remove the catalytic converter and convert to a high flow design, this still passes emissions testing (sniffer part) and has improved my gas mileage by about 2-3mpg overall. I still have two Precat&#39;s that take care of most the emissions and the 3rd cat (which I removed) was for the cars ULEV rating. Removing this has freed up about 10-15whp and 20lb*ft of torque in the low to midrange RPM&#39;s (which I seriously needed)

              <p>Ohio used to do emissions testing, and my 1990 454SS (that’s a 7.4L V8), that gets 12mpg, with all the emissions stuff unhooked, and no catalytic converter, still passed the test.  It was too low for them to see it didn’t have a cat, even with a mirror, so they always just passed it.</p>
<p>If that gas-sucking hog passes an emissions test, obviously they are just doing it for the money they make off the tests.</p>

<p>How are they going to check that?  Especially if your car is close to the ground.  If you are worried about it, get a heat shield off a catalytic converter and just bolt or weld it onto your pipe, it will look the same. :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Haha I laughed pretty hard when I read the “enjoy your traffic violations” part. I have been pulled over once in 3 years of driving (given a warning) and the absolute last thing a cop would ever do is get on the ground and try to wedge themselves under the low clearance of my car to attempt to see if I had a converter.</p>
<p>Like Mopar said, if I was really worried I would just take the heat shield of my old pipe and place it on my new one to pass a visual test (this is what people in California do) and the exhaust will still pass the sniffer test for emissions testing. I also live in a state with no emissions testing anyway so not to worried about that.</p>

<p>Also to rune3scapedude…this is a removal of the catalytic converter which restrict the flow through the exhaust, there were two people who had done before and after dynos for my same vehicle and they had very similar results to what I stated in the OP</p>
