              <p>Your running a server and do not know how to xml edit? That will result in A closed server.<br>
anyway it might be that you don’t have updated the item.rscd in the client or if your shop doesn’t sell that kind of items.<br>
If you use the ‘‘pot seller’’ you can’t just try selling him a r2h.</p>

              <p>If you changed the basepraice of the items in your server, you need todo it via Items.rscd client side too. Thats probally why it wont let you buy anything form your shops.</p>
