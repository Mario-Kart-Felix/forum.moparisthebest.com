We managed to escape it and I ended up in this house where this family was getting threanted by their father with a gun, and somehow, <span class="bbcode-u">I</span> ended up with a gun.

<p>Anyway the weirdest dream I had:</p>
<p>I woke up in a car, then some gang members were shooting me, then I teleported to their hut place. Then they said they need me to kill people at the white house. So I teleported to the white house, I saw Bush and Obama sitting next to each other and shook Bush’s hand but not Obama’s so was like “uhumm” then I shook his hand and started shaking other peoples hands. Then all of a sudden I turned into a RuneScape character with red dragonhide and a rune crossbow, and then I was getting ice barraged like crazy but they kept splatting. Some1 finally got me then I took out an ags and hit a 43 and owned them. Then I saw those gang people again with a red package which I knew was poison somehow lol. They were chasing me, then all of a sudden some1 napalm striked the place, then there were attack dogs. So I started ranging the attack dogs and the gang people joined in and they had blood blitz. Then I got teleported to my house, but it was my really old house back when I was very little like 2 and I lived in Staten Island. And then I told her you were going to die and she said it’s ok, then I teleported back to the gang place, then they tried to kill me by hitting me over the head with a wrench but the guy accidently hit himself with it so I kicked him in the nuts and teleported. Then I saw a friend there and he started going crazy and started pooping and eating it (don’t ask me lol) and then these weirdo flying squids came in and inked everywhere. Then I woke up.</p>

<p>Anyway the weirdest dream I had:</p>
<p>I woke up in a car, then some gang members were shooting me, then I teleported to their hut place. Then they said they need me to kill people at the white house. So I teleported to the white house, I saw Bush and Obama sitting next to each other and shook Bush’s hand but not Obama’s so was like “uhumm” then I shook his hand and started shaking other peoples hands. Then all of a sudden I turned into a RuneScape character with red dragonhide and a rune crossbow, and then I was getting ice barraged like crazy but they kept splatting. Some1 finally got me then I took out an ags and hit a 43 and owned them. Then I saw those gang people again with a red package which I knew was poison somehow lol. They were chasing me, then all of a sudden some1 napalm striked the place, then there were attack dogs. So I started ranging the attack dogs and the gang people joined in and they had blood blitz. Then I got teleported to my house, but it was my really old house back when I was very little like 2 and I lived in Staten Island. And then I told her you were going to die and she said it’s ok, then I teleported back to the gang place, then they tried to kill me by hitting me over the head with a wrench but the guy accidently hit himself with it so I kicked him in the nuts and teleported. Then I saw a friend there and he started going crazy and started pooping and eating it (don’t ask me lol) and then these weirdo flying squids came in and inked everywhere. Then I woke up.</p>
