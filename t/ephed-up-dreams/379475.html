        <p>Interesting, this was such a coincidence about making this thread because I just now woke up from a dream not even 20 minutes ago.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was having a dream about how we we’re first in a normal world (Sister, Me, and Ex), and that I was some kind of secret agent, so I had on the suit on and stuff. Then I started to love Ex again, so we started to hang out a lot. Then it started to get a little sexual but then something started to happen, we had like a war happening at our house like the Marines, and some other people. Then I was surprised from my sister’s appearance that I shot her in the heart.</p>

Or…<br>
I have a dream… A song to sing<br>
To help me cope… With anything<br>
If you see the wonders… Of a fairytale<br>
You can take the future… even if you fail</p>
<p>I BELIIEEVEEEE IN ANGELS!!!<br>
something good in everything I see<br>
I BELIIEEVEEEE IN ANGELS!!!<br>
When I know the time is right for me<br>
I’ll cross the stream… I have a dream</p>

        <p>My dream was about my bus driver driving to a hotel with all the kids inside but I’m pro so I called in a napalm strike and dclawed her</p>
<p>Yes most of my dreams involve RuneScape and COD, sometimes Minecraft lelel</p>
<p>Anyway the weirdest dream I had:</p>
<p>I woke up in a car, then some gang members were shooting me, then I teleported to their hut place. Then they said they need me to kill people at the white house. So I teleported to the white house, I saw Bush and Obama sitting next to each other and shook Bush’s hand but not Obama’s so was like “uhumm” then I shook his hand and started shaking other peoples hands. Then all of a sudden I turned into a RuneScape character with red dragonhide and a rune crossbow, and then I was getting ice barraged like crazy but they kept splatting. Some1 finally got me then I took out an ags and hit a 43 and owned them. Then I saw those gang people again with a red package which I knew was poison somehow lol. They were chasing me, then all of a sudden some1 napalm striked the place, then there were attack dogs. So I started ranging the attack dogs and the gang people joined in and they had blood blitz. Then I got teleported to my house, but it was my really old house back when I was very little like 2 and I lived in Staten Island. And then I told her you were going to die and she said it’s ok, then I teleported back to the gang place, then they tried to kill me by hitting me over the head with a wrench but the guy accidently hit himself with it so I kicked him in the nuts and teleported. Then I saw a friend there and he started going crazy and started pooping and eating it (don’t ask me lol) and then these weirdo flying squids came in and inked everywhere. Then I woke up.</p>
<p>Lol</p>

Some1 finally got me then I took out an ags and hit a 43 and owned them. Then I saw those gang people again with a red package which I knew was poison somehow lol. They were chasing me, then all of a sudden some1 napalm striked the place, then there were attack dogs. So I started ranging the attack dogs and the gang people joined in and they had blood blitz. Then I got teleported to my house, but it was my really old house back when I was very little like 2 and I lived in Staten Island. And then I told her you were going to die and she said it’s ok, then I teleported back to the gang place, then they tried to kill me by hitting me over the head with a wrench but the guy accidently hit himself with it so I kicked him in the nuts and teleported. Then I saw a friend there and he started going crazy and started pooping and eating it (don’t ask me lol) and then these weirdo flying squids came in and inked everywhere. Then I woke up.</p>

My dream was about my bus driver driving to a hotel with all the kids inside but I’m pro so I called in a napalm strike and dclawed her</p>
<p>Yes most of my dreams involve RuneScape and COD, sometimes Minecraft lelel</p>
<p>Anyway the weirdest dream I had:</p>
<p>I woke up in a car, then some gang members were shooting me, then I teleported to their hut place. Then they said they need me to kill people at the white house. So I teleported to the white house, I saw Bush and Obama sitting next to each other and shook Bush’s hand but not Obama’s so was like “uhumm” then I shook his hand and started shaking other peoples hands. Then all of a sudden I turned into a RuneScape character with red dragonhide and a rune crossbow, and then I was getting ice barraged like crazy but they kept splatting. Some1 finally got me then I took out an ags and hit a 43 and owned them. Then I saw those gang people again with a red package which I knew was poison somehow lol. They were chasing me, then all of a sudden some1 napalm striked the place, then there were attack dogs. So I started ranging the attack dogs and the gang people joined in and they had blood blitz. Then I got teleported to my house, but it was my really old house back when I was very little like 2 and I lived in Staten Island. And then I told her you were going to die and she said it’s ok, then I teleported back to the gang place, then they tried to kill me by hitting me over the head with a wrench but the guy accidently hit himself with it so I kicked him in the nuts and teleported. Then I saw a friend there and he started going crazy and started pooping and eating it (don’t ask me lol) and then these weirdo flying squids came in and inked everywhere. Then I woke up.</p>
