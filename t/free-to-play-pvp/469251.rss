    <title>Free To Play PVP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/free-to-play-pvp/469251</link>
    <description>Welcome to #1 Free to Play Player  VS Player

SERVER IS ONLINE (be aware is beta content soon to come)

SERVER LINK: http://free2play.zapto.org



With the new combat coming out, I thought there will be no more f2p pvp.  I like more the free to play combat style then the members pvp style. So I started working on this project. On my server you will gain  access only on the free to play map. Same it goes with the items and monsters. I added some Bosses, some of them are really hard if you take in consider the best defence gear is Full rune. 


At the moment I only added two high level monsters(bosses) and that&#39;s Elvarg and Evil Chicken. Future will be fallowed by Demon (from the Demon Slayer Quest), Rock Golem(random event), Tree Spirit (random event), Dr. Ford(random event) and  Zombie (random event).


ALL BUT ALL CONTENT IS 100% FREE TO PLAY
COMBAT TRAINING,SKILLS,ITEMS,MONSTERS,LOCATIONS,PVP WILD ZONE


COMBAT AND SKILL XP Rate will be high but be aware, the gold making in this game will be a pain in the ass. Because server will need a good economy so it can compete with the PVP drops. SO you can make money doing f2p skills or from pvp.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Most of the money making will be done with skill task. For example:<br>
I made a NPC that gives you a certain task like giving him 100 noted willow logs. After giving him the logs you will  get a payment in gold. Same for other skills(fishing,mining,crafting etc.). I’m doing this because the main focus of this server is not remaking old school runescape or something like that. The main purpose is PVP and with a unique 100% f2p feel.</p>
<p>But I’m open to suggestions. Most of the Costumes you can get them with Vote Points. Or trimmed gear with pk. Some of the costumes will be added in the future Bosses.</p>

<p>At the moment I’m adding finishing touches to Monsters(drops, correct animations).</p>
<p>Mining,Smithing,Firemaking,Woodcutting,Fishing they all have the correct f2p items to train. Skill Task’s are done only for Woodcutting and Fishing. I have to start working on crafting adding only the items that you can train on f2p.</p>
<p>The point system:<br>
Honor Point - 3 per kill. (Final)<br>
Vote Point - 5 per 12 hours. (Final)</p>
