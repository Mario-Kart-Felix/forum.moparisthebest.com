Hello welcome to the web host that suites your needs, i do no own the host and i was not requested to post this. I believe that any customer of a web host should take responsibility and show off the host that they use.

I personally bought the best plan here for a good reason, because its cheap and reliable. The host is never down, and the workers also provide assistance whether its required or not by the owner. I believe this web host is rather new to the web hosting environment but it also will be there for a LONG time. As a customer i do post this and ask you to take a look at the web host to see if you like it or not.

[COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;]Here are some details on the web host:[/COLOR]

[COLOR=&quot;Red&quot;]These are all features that come with every single plan above.[/COLOR]


[ul][*]Domain Registration for 15.00/ year OPTIONAL
[*]The latest Cpanel upgrades and improvements
[*]Fantastico
[*]phpMyAdmin
[*]File Manager
[*]Database Wizard
[*]Backup Wizard
[*]Daily Database Backups[/ul]



Since this is a rather new company for hosting, web hosting is the only hosting provided. Once the company gains more trust and becomes bigger then it will move into a VPS and Dedication hosting along with the web hosting. 

I suggest using this not because i said so, but because its cheap and reliable. You can get any package above easily from money made online whether its from borrowing it from a friend or from even surveys. Its only 1.25$ a month for the cheapest host, but yes you must follow the guide lines that are above such as you cant go over 2 gigs of bandwidth... ect...




Any questions? Post here im sure they will be answered.</description>
