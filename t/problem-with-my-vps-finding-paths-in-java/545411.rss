    <title>Problem with my vps finding PATHS in Java</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-my-vps-finding-paths-in-java/545411</link>
    <description>Well right after I got my vps, eclipse, and everything ran very smoothly, but I changed sources and now when I try to run eclipse, cannot find the path specified, even when i try to run my server, it says it cant find the path specified. I have been trying to fix this for about 3 hours, and I am just getting very frustrated. If anyone could help I would greatly appreciate it, and benefits could be involved depending on what you can do. My Skype is: jacob.doyle58

Thanks,
