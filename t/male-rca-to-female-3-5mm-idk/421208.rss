    <title>Male RCA to Female 3.5mm/idk</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/male-rca-to-female-3-5mm-idk/421208</link>
    <description>My tv speakers are pretty much broken. I have no idea what happened to them but after a while like a staticy crackling sound starting coming out all the time unless the audio was muted. Now it just plays a sort of medium pitched buz. I was trying to figure out a way to get audio from my ps to go out speakers. I have two speakers connected on AV OUT but no sound will come out of them so I was thinking, could I use a Male RCA to female 3.5mm to connect the AV OUT to a set of PC speakers and play the audio that way or could I get a female RCA to female 3.5mm(if thats possible) and directly connect the ps3 audio to the PC speakers?</description>

<p>You said you had AV out, that’s close enough.  Any form of audio out will do, though you may need some cheap adapters and shizz.</p>
