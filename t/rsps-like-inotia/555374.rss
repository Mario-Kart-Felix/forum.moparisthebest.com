    <description>I was trying to think of a way to write my rsps. I don&#39;t want it to be played like RuneScape and I want to to be my own story line, combat systems, skilling, etc. So, I ran across this game:

What do you guys think of an rsps being similar to the game above? I would actually like ideas on what would be very attractive to you in a rsps.</description>

              <p>Personally wouldn’t ever play something remotely close to this. I barely play any more but I think I can speak for quite a few when I say that runescape is the underlying reason that rsps are played, and if rsps wasn’t based on rs or didn’t have the rs feel, then I wouldn’t play.</p>
<p>Simply too much to learn and the efforts of learning a new game, especially something complex like an mmo definitely wouldn’t be worth the time</p>
