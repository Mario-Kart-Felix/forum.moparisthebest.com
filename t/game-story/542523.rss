    <description>So me and a few other people are going to be making our own MMORPG. We need some ideas on our story line. It&#39;s going to be during the Medieval period, so around the 5th-15th century. Now during this time, the catholic churches were very corrupt, so that&#39;s something I&#39;m taking to mind to maybe put into the story line.</description>
