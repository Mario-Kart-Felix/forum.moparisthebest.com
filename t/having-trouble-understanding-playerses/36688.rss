    <description>Ok I was trying to figure out how to make someone continuously
do an emote while walking, and the drunktimer in cheezscape really
looked like what I was looking for.  I just don&#39;t understand how it
specifies the emote to use. I recognised how it finds the correct
emotes for some weapons to create the correct output, but I
still dont get how it combines then to create the output. I know
the emote number for the drunk emote, but I do not see it in
that area. now I do recognise the 0x(number) from some of my
experience in other things, and I&#39;m sure the emote number is in
one of those things form that form, but I have no idea how to
convert a number in to that form. IF someone could help me
understand how this works, I could do some really cool things,
any help here?</description>

Make a new public int,</p>

<p>Now, make something in the public boolean process, for this…</p>

if (drunktimer = true)
