    <description>I was just wondering a few things, while looking at different languages, HTML seems to be the easiest, am I right? and will learning HTML help me with java?

PS: I found an HTML for dummies book in my house today, didn&#39;t know I had it so I&#39;m wondering if it will help me.</description>

<p>OT: i found these lecture videos useful, if u want to learn from watching a lecture. <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/video-lectures/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/video-lectures/</a> not only will you get an understanding of programming but you will be learning python. ik python is used quite a bit, google uses python in most of their open-source projects ive used(chromium, native client[used for compiling]). plus you will be able to program in jython. I started out learning javascript and html, which didnt help much. but the videos i listed above should help, i havent watched them all b/c they are 1 hr long and I dont really have the time.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s odd, because almost every program structure classes that I have looked at, and currently enrolled in. Deal with something related to BASIC. I’m not saying it’s a grand language, nor suggesting to fully learn it. Although it helps new programmers with basic concepts that all programming languages structure. I personally know BASIC, Java, and the mark up language HTML. I can honestly say I had no difficulty changing between them, you just need to realize that every programming language has its own rules and ways of programming it. Some represent similar structure, and syntax which people automatically assume makes it ‘easier’. Regardless, in his position where he doesn’t seem to know any programming language. I’d suggest just looking over examples of it, since it is literally baby programming. That way he understands IF whatever, does this. How to store values to variables, and may understand a bit about loops. If he feels prepared enough that he can just jump into a language, go for it. Although like I mentioned before, most programming logical/structure classes do touch on a language similar to, or is BASIC.[/quote]BASIC doesn’t make those concepts any simpler.</p>

<p>That’s odd, because almost every program structure classes that I have looked at, and currently enrolled in. Deal with something related to BASIC. I’m not saying it’s a grand language, nor suggesting to fully learn it. Although it helps new programmers with basic concepts that all programming languages structure. I personally know BASIC, Java, and the mark up language HTML. I can honestly say I had no difficulty changing between them, you just need to realize that every programming language has its own rules and ways of programming it. Some represent similar structure, and syntax which people automatically assume makes it ‘easier’. Regardless, in his position where he doesn’t seem to know any programming language. I’d suggest just looking over examples of it, since it is literally baby programming. That way he understands IF whatever, does this. How to store values to variables, and may understand a bit about loops. If he feels prepared enough that he can just jump into a language, go for it. Although like I mentioned before, most programming logical/structure classes do touch on a language similar to, or is BASIC.</p>

<p>My introductory course started with C. High school courses are that ones that teach BASIC, and it is counterproductive if you want to pursue computer science.</p>
<p>BASIC is, in essence, a entirely different type of programming. If you like the Visual Studio IDE, try C#. It has syntax near identical to Java, and you’ll have a much easier time switching languages.</p>
