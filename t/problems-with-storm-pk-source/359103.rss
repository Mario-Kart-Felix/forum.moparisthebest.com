    <title>Problems With Storm PK Source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-storm-pk-source/359103</link>
    <description>Ok so i have managed to get the server running with help from the fine people here on forums! However while checking the source i noticed a few problems with the source. I had a friend of mine log into the server just so i could test the dueling and trade handlers. I have noticed that everytime i try to trade i get into the trade screen and try to put an item up for trade the server crashes? I&#39;ve tried to find a tut on forums....found nothing!
I&#39;ve tried to go through the code...found nothing. In fact the files that handle trade on the server are exact to the files i have for another server. If anyone has any ideas or possibly a solution to this problem i would greatly appreciate the help?</description>
