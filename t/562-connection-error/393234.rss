    <title>562 connection error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-connection-error/393234</link>
    <description>On any server and client i use for the 562 revision, it may connect the first time but never a second time with the server on. i have to shut the server down then the client. then i can run the server and then the client and odds are it will not work. i have to repeat this over and over until it connects. I realized that if I log off my user on windows and log back on then repeat that works the best. please help me what do i have to do to change this??</description>
