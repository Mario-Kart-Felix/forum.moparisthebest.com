Hit Silver Division, but now I feel like I have no reason to play it. Honestly, odds are those ever started being updated again I might look at donating, but not in this state.<br>

Same, once I hit silver division I quit playing[/quote]<br>
Decided to play it a bit more, I ended up with way too much money. I ended up getting stuck on waiting for bars. Really wish there was more upgrades in terms of herb gathering and furnace speed.</p>

Yeah but the other half exists but doesn’t explain what it does for your game. When I say that I mean does having positive status’ give bonuses and do negative status’ give negative effects. The only known use I can see is for upgrading divisions.</p>

</aside>
<p>I believe if you left any program running all night like that, you’d wake up to the same conditions. Tablets are not computers, they’re not made to be left on for extended periods like that. and what you just did, have fun with your battery.<br>

<p>Yeah, waking up with it being “hot” is bad. You’re stressing the hell out of the battery, and it’s lifespan will drain so much faster that way.<br>
Overcharging is bad for it as well. I actually have a laptop I have to basically keep plugged in 24/7 because of it being overcharged and things like that, causing the battery to only have about 1 maybe 2 hours of life compared to about 12 (continuous) when I first got it.</p>
<p>I won’t try and stop you from doing it, but that’s seriously bad for the battery, and the components in the tablet itself.</p>

<p>im pretty sure unless you’ve got a fudgeing old battery overcharging is 99999 better than letting it run to almost empty before recharging, iirc thats how it works with newer battery technology[/quote]It is actually. With Li-ion or similar you schould keep it from getting too low as that damages it.</p>

<p>I’d rather invest in the power of JavaScript.</p>

What’s the point in playing this way?[/quote]<br>
I don’t feel like wasting <span class="bbcode-i">that</span> much time playing a javascript game in the first place. Sure, they can be fun. But 9/10 of them are this. An idle game.<br>
That’s really repetitive. And boring.<br>
So, I do this and see if there’s anything really different to it. And as always, not really.</p>
<p>Sorry mate. Just not my style of game (to OP). It was fun around the time when cookie clicker first came out, then everyone did their spin on it 1000 times over and killed it.</p>
