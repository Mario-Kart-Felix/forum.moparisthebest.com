    <title>Editing their 3d models possible?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/editing-their-3d-models-possible/2428</link>
    <description>Alright well maybe im wrong on all this, but I was thinking:

Typically the graphics are held client side on any game. Does that mean we have the ability to add in better graphics into clients? With my game, editing a graphic in the client just causes a MAV(memory access violation). So if it&#39;s not possible to change the graphics, would it be with a private server? Or are the graphics just encrytped into a data file? 

That leads me to a few other questions, would it be possible to perhaps change the scale on textures or exchange them for another texture? Perhaps add in a sky to runescape? I am a complete noob when it comes to &quot;how runescape works.&quot; All I know is that if I could change the graphics in runescape, I&#39;d make a hi-res 3d client.</description>

Cool! Well hopefully I can learn more about it soon. I don't know much java but I know enough about how graphics work in games and stuff.

<p>Yes. You can do that clientside if you find the right numbers.</p>

<p>Probably none, though you could probably convert the models into RS format. Anything is possible if want it bad enough, but it just be easier to not even worry about that yet. Ah, I'm going to bed soon.</p>
