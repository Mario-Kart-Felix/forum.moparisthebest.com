    <title>[639] Cant Log Out 5 Secs After Drop [Dementhium]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/639-cant-log-out-5-secs-after-drop-dementhium/437957</link>
    <description>Hey, how can i make it so, people cannot log out until 5 seconds after the item is dropped? There seems to be a dupe with that if the player Drops something goes to lobby and back, it refreshes in their inventory then pops up on the floor.

If somebody can help me please, help me. :s If all else fails i&#39;ll start paying :(

Thank you for your time, and perhaps consideration.

- Have a good day/night.</description>
