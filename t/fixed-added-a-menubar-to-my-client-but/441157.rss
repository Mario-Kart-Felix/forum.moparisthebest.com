    <title>FIXED! Added a menubar to my client but</title>

    <description>[s]Hi moparians,

I was just adding a menubar (just a plain awt menubar) to my client for my server. I should make note that the client is deltascape v11 client. I got everything working except for one minor glitch. Basically, the menubar overlaps my game window, covering up the top part of it. I tried moving to window down a bit, but when I tried that you have to click just above something for it to do anything (e.g. clicking a bit above an item to equip it). Anyways, I tried the best I could to explain the problem. Let me know if you need anymore information. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Found clues examining frame_sub1 that led me to applet_sub1 that led to what i needed to change :P Complicated I know...  :confused:</description>
