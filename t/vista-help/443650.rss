    <title>Vista! HELP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vista-help/443650</link>
    <description>It seems to be Mopar Help section for Mopar client... if it&#39;s not then move this thread please.

I did &#39;search&#39; for help but I only see problems and no solution.

No .jar files from any server ever worked for me unless it was in a complete launcher, I&#39;m sure we can&#39;t tell other server names on here but if any developper or whoever makes the launcher would be interested in making things easier for every Vista user(-.-) I can say 2 servers which works fine.

If anyone have an easy solution; I&#39;m willing to try it. I have downloaded and redownloaded and installed, reinstalled (times 100) every single thing I could find on the java website, tried to launch the .jar file with every java file, even read somewhere it worked with WinRAR and guess what, it still doesnt work. The other &#39;command file&#39; starts up, goes to &#39;Downloading File&#39; but stays stuck at 0% and crashes after a minute or two.

Any help ranging from an easy working version for vista to a not complicated way to make that .jar file work would be very appreciated.

Thanks!</description>
