    <description>I am positive each and every person here has had that one time where they were scammed miserably and felt like a noob.
Well, here&#39;s the place to tell that story!
Be it you or your friend, tell us about that time when you lost your items, account, or something else in RuneScape.
Alternatively, you can post the time when you scammed someone else.</description>

I am positive each and every person here has had that <span class="bbcode-b">one</span> time where they were scammed miserably and felt like a noob.<br>
[/quote]“One” time… Ahahaha… If only… Where do I start?<br>
2. I finally worked up enough money to buy a dragon med helm (900K back in the day) and upon doing so, I was fooled by the old two-person scam where one stands saying they’re selling something for a high amount of money and another says they’re buying it. Bad times.<br>
[/quote]Was it the bamboo reed? I got scammed and lost my dragon med the exact same way<br>
[/quote]Something similar. It was a thatch spar light, which is some tribal item you get in Karamja.[/quote]</p>
<p>I got scammed the exact same way, Let me tell you how lololol</p>
<p>Me and my bro were in world 2 fally park one day and we were supposed to be the scammers… So there for a few hours we were in beast mode. And i finally got that dleg scam, this was back when they were around like 2.5 or 3m, somewhere around that area. So you all know i was excited, Sold the dlegs got the money blah blah blah so on, Then these 2 stinky twats show up, and one was standing like 10blocks from the other, And all i seen was “Selling meat tenderizer 3m” “Buying Meat Tenderizer 5m” So you damn right i went to trade the guy. I bought it he logged, and i went to trade the other guy and he logged. Come to find out this damn thing was only like 40k. So i pmed my bro and said Screw you and logged off. Its funny now that i think of it, Still blame him to this day lolol.</p>

<p>Yea expelling from a house will now give you full hp and cure poison. It was patched around July 2007.[/quote]<br>
There’s still a scam that includes expelling people from your house though. If you can persuade a person to place an item on your table, you can then kick them out and you will be able to collect said item.</p>

              <p>I’ve been scammed from over 20m during 07-10 but then i was a mopard then. During 2012 I was so fed up of scammers, I wasted my 3m cash stack on hosting legit bidding games for people to enjoy, I didn’t take any money, until the winner put up their offer, and it would all be done in 1 trade, legitly. Things like this is what Me and my friends wanted to do.</p>

              <p>I remember when i first started playing runescape, i was running around near lummy when someone opened a trade with me and gave me a whole bunch of free junk. I thought i was rich, and was extremely happy. Later that day all i remember is for some reason trading it to some guy, and not getting anything in return. It sucked… Think it was a ‘i’ll give this item to the highest bidder’ scam which i fell for… so sad. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>A few years back I had around 50M and I had bought claws and mahog planks to get 99 mage off of. This guy then comes into Varry west bank saying to me that hes quitting and dropping his stuff (phat) in the pub by the sawmill. I went along with it because I was stupid and thought “Hey free money!” It then ends up with me not banking my planks or runes for some dumbass reason and me ending up in the beginning part of the wildy frozen by a ice barrage spell followed by a double claw spec. Lucky me I had lent out my claws for that day and had ~15M to return to.</p>
