    <title>A command i&#39;ve seen</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-command-ive-seen/236643</link>
    <description>Ok, i was on a random server and there was a command called &quot;vent&quot; where whatever you said like:  ::vent [message here]   npcs would say what was after the command i&#39;ve looked for it and cant find anything on it does anyone know how to make one like this?

I searched and this was the closest thing i found:
[code]else if (command.startsWith(&quot;vent&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2 &amp;&amp; (command.length() &gt; 5)) {

	for(int I = 0; I &lt; server.npcHandler.npcs.length; I++)
	{
		if (server.npcHandler.npcs[I] != null)
		{
			server.npcHandler.npcs[I].updateRequired = true;
			server.npcHandler.npcs[I].textUpdateRequired = true;
			server.npcHandler.npcs[I].textUpdate = command.substring(5);
		}
	}
} [/code]
