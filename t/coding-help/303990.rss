    <description>Hello all, My friend told me that he can make a client with 35 items in the inventory, he showed me, i did it
and now, my items are going off the page, because i made it be able to hold 65 items, instead of 28
He also told me that he can make his own class ( like class1.java) to make the items smaller, allthough, he is charging a fee, i cant afford it, and i was wondering if anyone has it, could/will make it for me, or knows someone who could, please respond, Thanks
