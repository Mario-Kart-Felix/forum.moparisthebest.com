    <description>Alright, I have these items[Torva]
And they appear to be like over powered. 
And then I need to change the rate they are dropped.

I&#39;m using LummyScape

The Torva is so over powered that you can almost one hit everything, then with the drops, Nex drops it every other time you kill it. And if you have full Torva, imagine how fast you could kill Nex. 

Thus you get alot of an item that is over powered.


If you think you can help please do let me know.

ALSO, I edited the item.cfg
So if you think you know how you can help me, PLEASE let me know. I got to get this over powered item more under powered.</description>
