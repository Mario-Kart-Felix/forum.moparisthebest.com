    <title>Dueling Option - VERY IMPORTANT</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dueling-option-very-important/330758</link>
    <description>Okay well I know dodian had an option where you could right click on a player and challenge them to a duel. I&#39;ve been wanting to add this into my server for a long time now and could never figure it out. Does anyone know the full dueling coding and where to put it all? This would help me out VERY MUCH and I would VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. I would offer something but I can&#39;t bribe so if you could help me that would be great! Thanks!</description>
