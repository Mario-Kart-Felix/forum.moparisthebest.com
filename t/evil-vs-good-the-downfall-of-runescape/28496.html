Hello Everyone! This is a remake of my old thread which reached 450 posts, on the runescape forum, and died while I was gone. 

Some of you may already know me, for those who don’t, I am Irwinner21, but you may call me Zach . 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

As I sit here, cutting trees, fishing or in a bank I hear a lot of things. Through this time I have learned this, most people care only about themselves and nothing more. Here is what I have found is the story of an average player. Here is his story, Let's call him "Bob" 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

Imagine this… 

Bob makes his way into Varrock passing all those Rune Essence miners; he then walks into the East Bank and he sees a green 3 and he notices someone is poisoned, they are pleading for help. He knows they will die if nothing is done. He then goes into His bank and see an Anti Poison then, he is about to give them it when he thinks to himself... 

“Hey!!! I can sell this to some ‘noob’ for 100 gp later.” 

The person who’s only wish was not to see that town of lost hope, Lumbridge again is now broken. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Now, he makes hsi way out of Varrock laughing at the person's death burying their bones as he walk past Gertrude’s House and he sees someone. They politely ask Bob “Which way to the Lumberyard?” He starts typing “north o”then, he thinks to himself... 


“Hey!!! L0l they don’t even know where the Lumberyard is!” 

Instead of saying “North of Varrock” he replies with “Noob” and walks away 

The person who’s only wish was to get a pet cat is now broken. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

</code></pre>
<p>He now has stumbled his way into Edgeville. He then sees someone who is lower combat than him they want to know which way to Falador. Bob almost tells the person South West and then he thought to himself…</p>
<p>“Hey!!! I should kill him for the fun of it!”</p>
<p>Bob next opens his bank, enter his PIN and withdrew the unknowing player’s soon-to-be death. Next Bob tells the player to “Follow me” he then brings him into Lvl 38 Wilderness and slaughters him. Why?</p>
<p>Not because Bob wanted his Bronze Sword, but because it will make the other player feel bad.</p>
<p>The person who wanted to meet his friend now release what happens when you try to trust another player.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> 
</code></pre>
<p>After selling that sword for 6gp Bob decides to fish north of the Al-Kaharid bank to get his fishing up when he sees a health bar appear and lose a quarter of its contents. Bob knows it’s not his, He’s too strong for that of course! Then Bob notices that it’s a lvl 6, getting killed by a scorpion, the player is asking for help and barely making a dent in the aracnid’s health. Since he can’t kill the scorpion, at first, Bob thinks he should help, but decides against it, figuring it’s the other person’s problem and Bob can’t be bothered with such “stupid things”. It’s not like 30 seconds of Bob’s time would have killed him or make him lose millions, it’s just that Bob didn’t care. As the poor fisherman screams for help, Bob laughs to himself, calling him a “noob”, and keeps on fishing.</p>
<p>The person dies, losing his black kite that he had just barely got the cash for. It’ll take him days to save up for another one, and he’s devastated. If he asked for it, Bob would have given it back, but in light of Bob not helping, he doesn’t ask. Instead, he sits at his computer, the impressionable 10 year old, crying to himself. As his tears fall on his keyboard, he is changed as a player forever. No more will the fisherman help the lvl 3 getting killed by a man in lumbridge, and when he gets to a higher lvl and he becomes a member, he will probably be a rude lout who can’t be bothered to offer some help.</p>
<p>Was all that really worth four ancovies Bob?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
</code></pre>
<p>Finally Bob makes his way into Falador. He then hears someone offering to Trim a new player’s Armour. That player comes up to Bob and asks Bob if they can do that. Bob is about to tell the person “no” and then he thinks to himself…</p>
<p>“Hey!!! That would make me “rofl” if he falls for it.”</p>
<p>Bob then answers with a “Yes” and watches the expecting player gives his armour away.</p>
<p>The person who dreamed of having colorful armour like all those high levels, now needs to start all over.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
A Few Months Later.... 

Do you remember that person who died in a bank from posion? Well, they see someone who is poisoned then go into thier bank and see an Anti Poison then, they are about to give them it when they think to thierself… 

"Hey!!! When I was poisoned no one helped me, why should I help?" 

</code></pre>
<p>Remember that person who wanted to know where the Lumberyard was? Well they saw someone wanting to know how to get into the Champion’s Guild. They almost help and then they think to thierself…</p>
<p>“Hey!!! No one helped me on a quest, why should I?”</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
Remember that player who wanted to know how to get to Falador? They are standing in Edgevill a person approaches them and asks "Where is Varrock" They almost tell them and then they think to thierself... 

"Hey!!! That one person killed me!!" 

They instead say "Follow Me" (You should know what happens next.) 

</code></pre>
<p>Remember that lvl 6 in Al Kaharid that Bob let be demolished by a Scorpian? He is now lvl 81. He is passing over White Wolf Montain and see’s a lvl 20 trying to pass over. The lvl 23 is being attacked by a bunch of wolves he asks that lvl 81 for some help. The lvl 81 almost attacks that wolf when he thinks to himself…</p>
<p>“Hey!!! When I needed help way back when no one helped me! They just started laughing at me and watched me die.!!! My Turn!”</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
Remember that one player who wanted to know if people could Trim Armour? 

They are now permanently banned for Item Scamming. 

</code></pre>
<p>Now…</p>
<p>Do you remember that player that Lied, Refused To Help Others, Desieved and was all around a mean person? Of course you do!</p>
<p>Often times pain is remembered easier than Love is. This is what others learn to reprduce, pain, hate and greed becuase that is how they were treated. That is what they think is right. This is what they will do, tell others to do and teach others to do.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">

</code></pre>
<p>Yes, there are nice players out there and to some it is greatly appriciated. Others were Lied To, Ignored, Desieved and Insulted so many times they don’t try to spread the help, but forget it. Spreading the pain. Therefore, helping The Battle of Kind vs. Mean become even more unbalanced than it already is.</p>
<p>If you had a choice back then, What would you do? Let’s say YOU were Bob back then how you treat others?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Closing 
Statement 
~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Well, I hope my thread made some of you think, if are sitting back thinking to youself... 

"Hey!!! That's Me I Am Bob!!!" 

What will you do next time? How will you change? Why does it matter? What's the point of being the old you? Is it worth it, is being mean to others worth a two secound laugh? WILL I EVER STOP TALKING? 

------------------------------------------------------------------ 

If you are sitting back thinking to yourself... 

"Hey!!! That Happened To Me!" 

What others have done to you is no reason to repeat it, it will only hurt you, them, and furture RuneScapers to come. 

------------------------------------------------------------------ 

If you are sitting back thinking to yourself... 

"Hey!!! I Am Already A Nice Player!" 

I have one simple response to you... 

THANK YOU! 

------------------------------------------------------------------ 

I hope you all enjoyed my thread and found a new view of the game. Happy Scaping to you all!

<p>This forum is for developing private servers. It is not a garbage can for your moronic RS sympathies. Go someplace where people give a shit about your worthless nonsense, or considering how moronic you are, you may have to settle for being in a forum where people don’t care about anything.

        <p>I know. I hate how JaGex runs things… I mean, you read the rules, and it cleary states that if someone talks and it comes up like ************* or whatever, you cannot be reported. BUT, NOOBS STILL REPORT YOU FOR IT, AND DO THEY GET BANNED FOR ABUSING THE RULES?!? NO! THE TALKER DOES! I don’t play RuneScape or MoparScape much anymore, because MoparScape doesn’t have a decent economy with a challenge, or anything, and they Mod anyone on RuneScape who reports like 3 people for talking with *********'s. I hate it…[br][size=1]Posted at: November 23, 2006, 11:11:31 PM[/size][hr]+ Java, this is the questions forum.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">
Hello Everyone! This is a remake of my old thread which reached 450 posts, on the runescape forum, and died while I was gone. 

Some of you may already know me, for those who dont, I am Irwinner21, but you may call me Zach . 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

As I sit here, cutting trees, fishing or in a bank I hear a lot of things. Through this time I have learned this, most people care only about themselves and nothing more. Here is what I have found is the story of an average player. Here is his story, Let's call him "Bob" 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

Imagine this
 

Bob makes his way into Varrock passing all those Rune Essence miners; he then walks into the East Bank and he sees a green 3 and he notices someone is poisoned, they are pleading for help. He knows they will die if nothing is done. He then goes into His bank and see an Anti Poison then, he is about to give them it when he thinks to himself... 

Hey!!! I can sell this to some noob for 100 gp later. 

The person whos only wish was not to see that town of lost hope, Lumbridge again is now broken. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Now, he makes hsi way out of Varrock laughing at the person's death burying their bones as he walk past Gertrudes House and he sees someone. They politely ask Bob Which way to the Lumberyard? He starts typing north othen, he thinks to himself... 


Hey!!! L0l they dont even know where the Lumberyard is! 

Instead of saying North of Varrock he replies with Noob and walks away 

The person whos only wish was to get a pet cat is now broken. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

</code></pre>
<p>He now has stumbled his way into Edgeville. He then sees someone who is lower combat than him they want to know which way to Falador. Bob almost tells the person South West and then he thought to himself</p>
<p>Hey!!! I should kill him for the fun of it!</p>
<p>Bob next opens his bank, enter his PIN and withdrew the unknowing player’s soon-to-be death. Next Bob tells the player to Follow me he then brings him into Lvl 38 Wilderness and slaughters him. Why?</p>
<p>Not because Bob wanted his Bronze Sword, but because it will make the other player feel bad.</p>
<p>The person who wanted to meet his friend now release what happens when you try to trust another player.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> 
</code></pre>
<p>After selling that sword for 6gp Bob decides to fish north of the Al-Kaharid bank to get his fishing up when he sees a health bar appear and lose a quarter of its contents. Bob knows it’s not his, He’s too strong for that of course! Then Bob notices that it’s a lvl 6, getting killed by a scorpion, the player is asking for help and barely making a dent in the aracnid’s health. Since he can’t kill the scorpion, at first, Bob thinks he should help, but decides against it, figuring it’s the other person’s problem and Bob can’t be bothered with such “stupid things”. It’s not like 30 seconds of Bob’s time would have killed him or make him lose millions, it’s just that Bob didn’t care. As the poor fisherman screams for help, Bob laughs to himself, calling him a “noob”, and keeps on fishing.</p>
<p>The person dies, losing his black kite that he had just barely got the cash for. It’ll take him days to save up for another one, and he’s devastated. If he asked for it, Bob would have given it back, but in light of Bob not helping, he doesn’t ask. Instead, he sits at his computer, the impressionable 10 year old, crying to himself. As his tears fall on his keyboard, he is changed as a player forever. No more will the fisherman help the lvl 3 getting killed by a man in lumbridge, and when he gets to a higher lvl and he becomes a member, he will probably be a rude lout who can’t be bothered to offer some help.</p>
<p>Was all that really worth four ancovies Bob?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
</code></pre>
<p>Finally Bob makes his way into Falador. He then hears someone offering to Trim a new player’s Armour. That player comes up to Bob and asks Bob if they can do that. Bob is about to tell the person no and then he thinks to himself…</p>
<p>Hey!!! That would make me “rofl” if he falls for it.</p>
<p>Bob then answers with a Yes and watches the expecting player gives his armour away.</p>
<p>The person who dreamed of having colorful armour like all those high levels, now needs to start all over.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
A Few Months Later.... 

Do you remember that person who died in a bank from posion? Well, they see someone who is poisoned then go into thier bank and see an Anti Poison then, they are about to give them it when they think to thierself
 

"Hey!!! When I was poisoned no one helped me, why should I help?" 

</code></pre>
<p>Remember that person who wanted to know where the Lumberyard was? Well they saw someone wanting to know how to get into the Champion’s Guild. They almost help and then they think to thierself…</p>
<p>“Hey!!! No one helped me on a quest, why should I?”</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
Remember that player who wanted to know how to get to Falador? They are standing in Edgevill a person approaches them and asks "Where is Varrock" They almost tell them and then they think to thierself... 

"Hey!!! That one person killed me!!" 

They instead say "Follow Me" (You should know what happens next.) 

</code></pre>
<p>Remember that lvl 6 in Al Kaharid that Bob let be demolished by a Scorpian? He is now lvl 81. He is passing over White Wolf Montain and see’s a lvl 20 trying to pass over. The lvl 23 is being attacked by a bunch of wolves he asks that lvl 81 for some help. The lvl 81 almost attacks that wolf when he thinks to himself…</p>
<p>“Hey!!! When I needed help way back when no one helped me! They just started laughing at me and watched me die.!!! My Turn!”</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
Remember that one player who wanted to know if people could Trim Armour? 

They are now permanently banned for Item Scamming. 

</code></pre>
<p>Now…</p>
<p>Do you remember that player that Lied, Refused To Help Others, Desieved and was all around a mean person? Of course you do!</p>
<p>Often times pain is remembered easier than Love is. This is what others learn to reprduce, pain, hate and greed becuase that is how they were treated. That is what they think is right. This is what they will do, tell others to do and teach others to do.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">

</code></pre>
<p>Yes, there are nice players out there and to some it is greatly appriciated. Others were Lied To, Ignored, Desieved and Insulted so many times they don’t try to spread the help, but forget it. Spreading the pain. Therefore, helping The Battle of Kind vs. Mean become even more unbalanced than it already is.</p>
<p>If you had a choice back then, What would you do? Let’s say YOU were Bob back then how you treat others?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Closing 
Statement 
~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Well, I hope my thread made some of you think, if are sitting back thinking to youself... 

"Hey!!! That's Me I Am Bob!!!" 

What will you do next time? How will you change? Why does it matter? What's the point of being the old you? Is it worth it, is being mean to others worth a two secound laugh? WILL I EVER STOP TALKING? 

------------------------------------------------------------------ 

If you are sitting back thinking to yourself... 

"Hey!!! That Happened To Me!" 

What others have done to you is no reason to repeat it, it will only hurt you, them, and furture RuneScapers to come. 

------------------------------------------------------------------ 

If you are sitting back thinking to yourself... 

"Hey!!! I Am Already A Nice Player!" 

I have one simple response to you... 

THANK YOU! 

------------------------------------------------------------------ 

I hope you all enjoyed my thread and found a new view of the game. Happy Scaping to you all!
