              <p>Meh, They are still noobs and that ask stupid shit, they should know at least how to do that sort of stuff if they want to make their own servers. All they do is ask for people to paste codes for them to copy to their servers…They should be asking how to do those things not just for someone to post it all done…And the name is <s>post commands here</s> made by zilchuary and 0 a11 d3d 0~~ So by the looks of it they do want commands…So I’m pretty sure i did read…</p>
