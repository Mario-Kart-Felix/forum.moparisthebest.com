    <title>Midnattens Widunder: A Role Play</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/midnattens-widunder-a-role-play/16555</link>
    <description>i&#39;ve got this idea from another forum, it&#39;s called a role play.
it&#39;s basicly some kind of game, where you make up your own story, in a non-existant world, for an example, check [url=http://wurmonline.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=18]here[/url].
When you make your story, you should try to use your fantasy as much as possible :)


It was ten hours ago that Jakten woke up, not knowing where he was.
He noticed that he was stuck in a huge pit.
He tried to get out several times, but it gave him some injuries only.
After awhile, he noticed some sort of strange cave, leading upwards.
So, he walked up, all of sudden, he thought that the ground had disappeard, but there was luckily for him a small ledge where he could walk over.
below him was some kind of bottomless pit, and he vaguely heard screeches from below.
When he got out of the cave, he found a big, beautiful lake, with fresh water and alot of fish.

After he came back from day dreaming, he started tending his wounds, and he started to drink some water, and he tried to catch some fish with his hands.
It didn&#39;t work out quite well, but he managed to catch a small perch after 30 mins.
He was hungry, so he ate it right away.
He noticed that he smelled.
His clothes, just common clothes for a man his age, were all dirty, because of the failed attempts of climbing out the hole.
So he took of his clothes and washed them, and he took a dive.
He dried his clothes and when he was dried himself, he put this clothes back on.
Suddenly, he noticed that something wasnt quite as it should.
Jakten looked around, noticing that there were two eyes staring at him....
