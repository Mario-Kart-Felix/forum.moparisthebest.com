    <title>Should I be worried?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-i-be-worried/522654</link>
    <description>Ok so the problem is I downloaded a source+client and when I did google chrome said it was malicious but I used it before on a different computer and there was no problem. So just to be sure I scanned it and there was no threat found. I checked all the runs/compilers before I ran any of it and I still found nothing. After awhile I still found nothing but I am just wondering is it ok to still be using it even though google chrome said that it might be malicious??</description>

              <p>Ok so the problem is I downloaded a source+client and when I did google chrome said it was malicious but I used it before on a different computer and there was no problem. So just to be sure I scanned it and there was no threat found. I checked all the runs/compilers before I ran any of it and I still found nothing. After awhile I still found nothing but I am just wondering is it ok to still be using it even though google chrome said that it might be malicious??</p>
