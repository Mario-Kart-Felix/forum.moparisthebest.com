    <title>World 1 Community Farm</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/world-1-community-farm/440535</link>
    <description>One reason I have seen new people quitting lately is because they spawn in areas devoid of resources (i.e. wood, food), and rage cuz they die or cant get anything. Badger41 and myself created a community tree farm to help a new player start out, as obviously all the resources around spawn are hard to get. Pretty much the day we made it, all of the rules posed for it were broken (half-cut trees, trees not replanted, and saplings stolen). It would be nice to see this tree farm work so that new players have a chance before they rage. 

I have a couple recommendations, but i need ideas:

[ul][li]Remove sapling chests and force the player who cut down the tree to use saplings produced by the tree.[/li]
[li]Be more strict on punishments associated with the farm. For instance, make stealing from the chest a bannable offense. As the farm belongs to the community, not just one person. [/li]
[li]Maybe include a way for the player to harvest food so they do not starve, or have pitiful health.[/li]
[li]Hopefully see more support in the project, if the punishments aren&#39;t legit, than the crime isn&#39;t. It would be nice to see more moderators or even players at least check the farm from time to time. The farm most likely wont succeed, but unless we try, how could it?[/li][/ul]


As of today, I have replanted all of the farm except jungle trees, and that is only because they are rare in world 1.

Anyone who does this deserves to be smacked with a diamond spade...

But on a serious note, stop only cutting down a tree half way. If its one of those big trees, just leave it alone, it looks terrible near spawn, and is technically griefing because you are destroying blocks and altering the landscape at someone&#39;s place. At the tree farm this is bannable.</description>

              <p>That is definitely true, and i completely agree that new players shouldn’t be handed stuff. The only reason I brought it up was because iv’e seen many new players give up and it makes me wonder if something with spawn could be handled better. Like I said its really all about suggestion, the only point of this post is to find ways to expand the community and see if there is something that we can do to improve the first impressions a person receives.</p>

              <p>While I agree we should give opportunity for new players to start Moparcraft I don’t agree on taking any special measures in order to assure that. Giving new players stuff on that level teaches them nothing but to rely on others and not their own skills.</p>
<p>Besides, new players have it easy these days, the PVP activity of the server has began to die down (well, I’m busy so theres no one to start it all) so playing the game should be pretty damn easy.</p>
<p>If you want to create a secure environment for new players to achieve themselves a bedrock foundation then there are many methods currently available such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>creating a city/village/whatever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>simply handing out stuff to them in the current server situation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>simply showing them good places to build and generally being helpful</p>
</li>

              <p>true saplings aren’t valuable, but to players who is just starting out and don’t have all kinds of stuff, its can help that person get a solid foundation. I have been asked dozens of times for food and simple supplies from our castle at spawn. I think it would be a good idea to give new players an opportunity to get started. But that’s my take on it.</p>

              <p>Being honest, as active as I am <em>wink</em>  :|, I am against stealing from the chest being a bannable offence. Although it is a community farm, a sapling is not particularly a rare or valuable resource. If I were you, I’d keep the main bulk of your saved saplings in a locked chest and then ration them out to your open chests, so if you lose some, you don’t lose all of them as you still have your main supply locked away. <em>refers to saying of not keeping your eggs in one basket</em></p>
<p>edit: This is just my opinion by the way.</p>
