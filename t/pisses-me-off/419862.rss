    <title>Pisses me off</title>

    <description>It really pisses me off seeing these botting website owners saying that there bots will be back up. They are basically saying &quot;We will be back soon to fuck up the game&quot; I swear if I known these developers IRL i&#39;d knock their scummy teeth in. And all the fucking 10 year old kids saying &quot;Plz bots soon&quot; shit like that. *Facepalm* they need to fuck off.</description>

              <p>Really? If I were these developers id only allow 1 bot to run per computer and not allow bots for things like barrows/gwd, and set the max botting time to 6-7 hours a day. They would basically be playing the same amount as any other player and not fuck anything up. And this wouldn’t be a big deal for those people who bot because they’re focused on school etc. If you feel like that^^ wouldn’t be right, consider yourself a hardcore botter and no one likes you.</p>
