This is a few months old, and I think I posted this on mitb a while back. But, I think there is more relevance for it being posted over here. I see people trying to big themselves up above others by correcting spelling, grammar and the way people produce their sentences. 

If you&#39;re on one of those people, and I admit - I&#39;ve done it and do it too (though, rarely random attacks, like many on here are guilty of), watch the video - and rethink your ways!</description>
