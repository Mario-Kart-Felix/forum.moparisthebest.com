              <p>Try typing a little slower, you’ll speed up eventually.<br>
Also, this belongs in client help… but Whatever, nobody will listen.</p>
<p>Make sure you have portforwarded. Check on   <a href="http://Canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Canyouseeme.org</a><br>
Make sure you have changed your IP in the server files.<br>
Compile and restart server.</p>
