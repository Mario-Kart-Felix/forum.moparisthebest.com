    <title>Please explain why</title>

    <description>If it is against the rules for people to grave dig, Mopar doesn&#39;t just set it so that once the thread passes the page he considers grave digging, it automatically gets locked, then we wouldn&#39;t have to worry about:

A) Wondering whether were going to get in trouble for bumping it.

B) Having to worry about past threads coming back.

It seems like really dumb that this hasn&#39;t already been suggested.</description>

              <p>Exactly.  If its been bumped up for a valid reason, I see no problem with it.  But making a pointless, non-contributing post to an ancient topic serves no purpose (besides annoying everyone).  Auto-locking has been brought up before, but I personally don’t like forums that have that feature…its as if they are restricting what you can do.  I’m sure there’s something about this in the Site Discussions forum if you want to have a look.</p>

              <p>Personally, I overlook gravedigging if it adds something to the topic at hand.</p>
<p>9 times out of 10, it’s someone saying “lol cool” or “this dosen’t work!”, which is annoying at the best of times, but even worse when the topic is 2 years old.</p>
