    <title>Client co-ordinate understanding?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-co-ordinate-understanding/311075</link>
    <description>Okay, I have absolutely no experience in client-side things so here&#39;s my question:

How can I find Co-ordinates for things such as interfaces to input text.

Example:
Music tab or Pest Control, writing that would be essential to game-play. Is the Co-ordinates the same as RSBot&#39;s mouse Co-ordinates, or is it a specific line of code elsewhere?</description>
