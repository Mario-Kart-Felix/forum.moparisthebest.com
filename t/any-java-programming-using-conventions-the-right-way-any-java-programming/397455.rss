    <description>WARNING: This is a pretty straightforward and common-sense tutorial, but people still make these convening errors. Read on if you would like, and comment with some feedback on how I did/things to add/criticism.

Alright, so after looking at some other bases and servers I was curious about, I came to this conclusion: Nobody except a few selected people can properly use conventions. Im not even counting myself to that list because I&#39;ve just been programming for a couple years, so I don&#39;t know every shortcut; therefor, I will add to this list once I see any more errors or other problems people do in there convening. So, here is the list so far:


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[CODE]
case 5:
doSomething();
case 9:
doSomething();
case 63:
doSomething();
[/CODE]

Don&#39;t do that, it&#39;s just a waste of space. Sure, it&#39;s only 2-3 lines of unnecessary code, but now let&#39;s do some math: if we did this for every case (I&#39;m just counting my object handler), there are over 700 cases in there. Now, not every case is the same, but things like altars or banks use the same method. Lets say out of those 700 cases, there are 400 that could have been convened into an existing method. So, thats 400x2 or 3, equalling a total of 800-1200 lines of bullshit code! Sure, your probably thinking that&#39;s OK, but I&#39;m just talking about my object handler. There are many more classes using methods, and therefor it would be spastic to see people not using these simple methods of convening. 

So, before you write up a new case, search for the method you want to input onto that case. Look for yourCaseMethod();, and if nothing comes up, go right ahead and create a whole new case. If it does, just add in that case above the other case, like this:

[CODE]
case 5:
case 9:
case 63:
doSomething();
[/CODE]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can&#39;t stand seeing all these in area and out of area statements using true or false booleans. It drives me nuts when something so simple can be dragged into something this difficult:
[CODE]
if (IsInArea == true) {
doSomethingCool();
}
else if (IsInArea == false) {
doSomethingGay();
}
[/CODE]

Holy shit, writing that made me puke. 

Now, let&#39;s take a look at this code snippet; instead of using a simple if (IsInArea), I used booleans. :fp: I can&#39;t tell you how much easier this could be, so I&#39;ll show you:

[CODE]
if (IsInArea) {
doSomethingCool();
}
else if (!IsInArea) {
doSomethingGay();
}

[/CODE]
Pretty simple but if you download some PI bullshit, there&#39;s a ton of these stupid snippets.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Booleans are a small problem for the R-S community, but there are still some occasions people write out something that takes more time, could be shorter, and much cleaner. Example:

[CODE]
public boolean something = false;
[/CODE]

Why waste your time (I know were talking about miliseconds, but what if your rewriting a class?) writing that out when you can simply do:


[CODE]
public boolean exp;
[/CODE]

All booleans, if left alone, are set to false. So, if you want it to be true, go ahead and add a true; to the end of it; still in any case if it&#39;s false, just use the default.

The same thing goes for integers, like points or something. Instead of writing out:

[CODE]
Points = 0;
[/CODE]

You can easily leave it like:

[CODE]
Points;
[/CODE]

This is because all integers, if not given a value, are defaulted to a 0. If you want it to start out as something more, just do Points = 500; or something else.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When writing a code referring to a different class, try to make it as clean as possible. Don&#39;t write out org.hyperion.rs2.features.skills.magic.barrage(). There is just no need to look back and forth at the class packets and where everything is located. I hope I don&#39;t have to make examples since what I said is pretty straight forward.

If you don&#39;t use an IDE (WHICH YOU SHOULD), then read the rest of this spoiler. If you do, then just skip this part.

If you look at this code:

[CODE]
if (someFeature == 0) {
setSomeInterface(1, 1111);
someFeature == 1;
}
[/CODE]

You can see there aren&#39;t any indentations. This is optional, but you can make it much more organized and in-place if you indent. So, write out:

[CODE]
if (playerAncientMagics == 0) {
[/CODE]

And then, go to the next line and press TAB. It will move your line to the right, showing that it belongs under that if statement.


Here is what a proper if statement should look like (in my opinion):

[CODE]
if (playerAncientMagics == 0) {
            setSidebarInterface(6, 1151);
            playerAncientMagics = 0;
}
[/CODE]


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is pretty easy, yet people still do this:

[CODE]
private int attack;
private int strength;
private int defence;
private int magic;
private int prayer;
[/CODE]

Instead of:

[CODE]
private int attack, strength, defence, magic, prayer;
[/CODE]

Seriously, just use the easier way. I know you sometimes forget to add onto another int, but waste the 2 seconds it takes you to search and use the smaller code. I mean, why use 5 lines of code when you can use 1?





EDIT LIST:
6/1/2011 8:38PM - Added int list, I just saw how they were listed in a PI I was looking at.</description>

              <p>I find it amusing when you write an article in the ‘Server Tutorials’ about ‘Java Conventions’ when you do not use conventions in any of those examples and the fact that since the topic is java scoped, it should be in the programming section. This was just terrible, none of this had to do with conventions on a second read. Common rules: if its a constants its capitalized, parameters should not be mixed case, ternary is your friend, comment your code. You missed all of these.</p>
<p>Conventions don’t lead to clean code, they lead to easy to read code which may be clean or not because a 10 part ternary statement can look gross but conventionally; its perfect.</p>
