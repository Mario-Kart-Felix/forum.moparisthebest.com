        <p>Hey guys, well i saw the other post on 508 basic tutorials except it didnt tell you as much as i wanted to know and I have had a 508 server for about a week and i figured mostly how to do everything on my own. Im going to tell you most of the things I learned.</p>
<p>[size=20pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">How to place npcs</span></span>[/size]<br>
Difficulty- 1/10<br>
Requirements- To know how to click and find out coords and npc ID’s</p>
<p>How to place NPC’s is pretty simple and doesnt take that much time. Should take you at least a minute or two to place a NPC.</p>
<p>So to start (im using tokkulscape) go into the main files go to bin &gt; Npc &gt; Npcspawn.cfg</p>
<p>You will then see all of the spawns that are on the server. So scroll to the bottom and add a new spawn. To do this copy this…</p>
<p>spawn	=       0	3166	3484	0	0	0	0	0	Hans</p>
<p>Explaining Code…</p>
<p>the “spawn” part means…spawn…lol</p>
<p>the 0 that comes after that is the npc ID. To find this in some bubly servers right click on an npc and click examine. Then it will say the ID. Or just find a NPC ID list and search for what you want</p>
<p>the 3166 is the X coordinate. This is how the server knows where to place him. So to find this you can type ::coords. it comes us as X coordinate, and then the Y Coordinate</p>
<p>the 3484 is the Y coordinate. To find it do the same thing as the X Coordinate.</p>
<p>the 0’s after that I have no idea what they do lol. But the main things are the first 3 numbers. Then at the end is the name of the NPC and its just used to help you find out who it is.</p>
<p>Then Save and Compile and your done.</p>
<p>[size=20pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">How to Place Global Object</span></span>[/size]<br>
Difficulty- 1/10<br>
Requirements- How to click, and find coordinates. Also to know object codes</p>
<p>This one is also pretty simple. First go to Bubly &gt; IO &gt; Frames.java</p>
<p>When you go into Frames.java search for(ctrl+F)…</p>
<p>createGlobalObject(p,</p>
<p>When you find the first one scroll to the end of them and you will see something like this…</p>
<p>createGlobalObject(p, 13615, 0, 2964, 3356, 2, 10);</p>
<p>Explaining the code…</p>
<p>first the 13615 is the Object Id Code. With TokkulScape comes lists with a bunch of ID’s and other things. Or you could find them somewhere else.</p>
<p>the 0 after that is the floor height of floor your on. So like 2 or 3 or 1 or 0.</p>
<p>The 2964 is the X coordinate of the place you want to put the object (::coords)</p>
<p>the 2964 is the Y coordinate of the place you want to put it (::coords)</p>
<p>then the 2 after that is how you want to turn it. Or which way you want it to face.</p>
<p>Then leave the 10 at the end how it is.</p>
<p>Then Save and Compile and your done!!</p>
<p>[size=20pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">How to make NPC’s Talk!!</span></span>[/size]<br>
Difficulty-2/10<br>
Requirements-How to copy and paste. And to know NPC ID’s</p>
<p>This one is a little harder but is still pretty basic</p>
<p>First go to Bubly &gt; npcs &gt; NPC.java</p>
<p>Open up the file and then search for(ctrl+F)…</p>
<p>if (npcType ==</p>
<p>and once you find it, it will look something like this…</p>
<p>if (npcType == ###) {<br>
requestText(“Welcome to Dark Dag Scape!!!”);<br>
requestAnim(-1, 1);<br>
}</p>
<p>Explaining the code…</p>
<p>the number after the "npcType == " is the NPC ID. To find this right click on the NPC you want to talk and pick examine. The ID number will then come up in the chat box. If it doesnt find an NPC ID List.</p>
<p>the “requestText(“Welcome to Dark Dag Scape!!!”);” is where you right your text. So change the “Welcome to Dark Dag Scape!!!” to what you want it to say.</p>
<p>Then the “requestAnim(-1, 1);” is where you can put in an animation number. The default is what is in there right now.</p>
<p>So once you save and Compile your done!!!</p>
<p>That is some of the things I learned! I will make another tutorial on how to add shops, teleports, and tabs that let you teleport!! HOPE YOU LIKED IT!!!</p>
