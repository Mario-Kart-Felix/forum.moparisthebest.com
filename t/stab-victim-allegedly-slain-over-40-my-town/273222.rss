    <title>Stab victim allegedly slain over $40 [My Town]</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;TORONTO -- A young man knifed at a Hamilton bar was killed after walking away from an argument about a petty debt, his family said yesterday.

Paul DaSilva, 20, was at Whiskey Joe&#39;s bar at Fennell Ave. E. and Upper Ottawa St. when he got in an argument with an acquaintance who owed him around $40 just before 11 p.m. Friday, cousin Brittany Allan said.

&quot;There was no fight,&quot; Allan said. &quot;They were just arguing about it ... they said a couple words inside and then apparently Paul went outside on his cellphone.&quot;

Once on the patio, DaSilva was stabbed several times in his torso. He was dead upon arrival at hospital.

DaSilva&#39;s mother, Shelley, and 22-year-old twin sisters, Arryn and Ashly, struggled to make sense of their sudden loss, Arryn Dean said.

&quot;We&#39;re completely shocked how someone would (allegedly take) someone&#39;s life for something so small. It&#39;s not worth it,&quot; Dean said through tears. &quot;We&#39;re all destroyed.&quot;

DaSilva grew up with his mother and sisters in Hamilton, where he had a large group of friends who are &quot;heartbroken,&quot; Dean said. With an infectious smile and great sense of humour, &quot;Paul was always the life of the party.

&quot;Paul is the kind of person that would take his shirt off his back and give it to you,&quot; his sister said. &quot;He was kind. He was caring. He was loving. He would do anything for anybody.&quot;

On Friday, DaSilva returned to his apartment after a day of working at Harvey&#39;s. He was outvoted by friends who wanted to go to Whiskey Joe&#39;s to hear their friends&#39; band play, girlfriend Chantelle Murray, 22, recalled.

&quot;He didn&#39;t even want to go,&quot; Murray said. &quot;He said he&#39;d go anywhere else but there.&quot;

The band was still playing when DaSilva was killed, Murray said. &quot;He was the love of my life and I&#39;m never going to forget him.&quot;

Within hours of DaSilva&#39;s death, 18-year-old Dylan Scott, who DaSilva knew from Sherwood Secondary School, was arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, Hamilton Police Staff-Sgt. Ian Matthews said. It&#39;s unknown how the teen allegedly made his way into the licensed bar.

&quot;Two lives just wasted for nothing,&quot; Matthews said yesterday after finding a pocket knife in a nearby storm sewer.

&quot;Unfortunately it seems that more and more kids are carrying knives and going to bars. What would have been a fist-fight before now turns into a homicide. It&#39;s just sad.&quot;

This was Hamilton&#39;s third homicide of the year.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <blockquote>TORONTO -- A young man knifed at a Hamilton bar was killed after walking away from an argument about a petty debt, his family said yesterday.
<p>Paul DaSilva, 20, was at Whiskey Joe’s bar at Fennell Ave. E. and Upper Ottawa St. when he got in an argument with an acquaintance who owed him around $40 just before 11 p.m. Friday, cousin Brittany Allan said.</p>
<p>“There was no fight,” Allan said. “They were just arguing about it … they said a couple words inside and then apparently Paul went outside on his cellphone.”</p>
<p>Once on the patio, DaSilva was stabbed several times in his torso. He was dead upon arrival at hospital.</p>
<p>DaSilva’s mother, Shelley, and 22-year-old twin sisters, Arryn and Ashly, struggled to make sense of their sudden loss, Arryn Dean said.</p>
<p>“We’re completely shocked how someone would (allegedly take) someone’s life for something so small. It’s not worth it,” Dean said through tears. “We’re all destroyed.”</p>
<p>DaSilva grew up with his mother and sisters in Hamilton, where he had a large group of friends who are “heartbroken,” Dean said. With an infectious smile and great sense of humour, "Paul was always the life of the party.</p>
<p>“Paul is the kind of person that would take his shirt off his back and give it to you,” his sister said. “He was kind. He was caring. He was loving. He would do anything for anybody.”</p>
<p>On Friday, DaSilva returned to his apartment after a day of working at Harvey’s. He was outvoted by friends who wanted to go to Whiskey Joe’s to hear their friends’ band play, girlfriend Chantelle Murray, 22, recalled.</p>
<p>“He didn’t even want to go,” Murray said. “He said he’d go anywhere else but there.”</p>
<p>The band was still playing when DaSilva was killed, Murray said. “He was the love of my life and I’m never going to forget him.”</p>
<p>Within hours of DaSilva’s death, 18-year-old Dylan Scott, who DaSilva knew from Sherwood Secondary School, was arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, Hamilton Police Staff-Sgt. Ian Matthews said. It’s unknown how the teen allegedly made his way into the licensed bar.</p>
<p>“Two lives just wasted for nothing,” Matthews said yesterday after finding a pocket knife in a nearby storm sewer.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately it seems that more and more kids are carrying knives and going to bars. What would have been a fist-fight before now turns into a homicide. It’s just sad.”</p>
<p>This was Hamilton’s third homicide of the year.</p>
