    <description>I need someone to point me to a server and client that DOES NOT HAVE THE DWARF REMAINS, RESET LOOK, SKILLS AND ITEMS BUG! I downloaded too many server, and tried changing too many things to get it to work. The most recent one that has had this issue was demise&#39;s pk server. Unless this bug will always happen no matter what, please point me to a server without this issue!</description>

              <p>No such thing.</p>
<p>And if there was, it wouldn’t be available for download. Dwarf remains are just the default item that appears when a null occurs.</p>
<p>Your server was obviously not set-up for that client.</p>
<p>The only thing to do is create your own. Good luck.</p>
