    <description>A container with 300g of water is heated up. The water was originally warmed for 50s and then the temperature was measured in 30s intervals. The measurements are presented in the table below:

Time(s)     [50] [80] [110] [140] [170] [200]
Temp (C*) [37] [50] [62]  [73]   [84]  [92]

a) Make a graph of temperature as a function of time. How far can you extrapolate?
b) What was the temperature of the water at the beginning of the heating process?
c) Guess what was the temperature of water at 300s

Me:
a) For the extrapolation I would&#39;ve guessed that to the point where the water reaches 100C since after that it changes into gas. Y/N?
b) I have no clue about this. ??? 
c) There is no water at 300s because it&#39;s all gas so 0C</description>

<p>Do you have a graphing calculator?</p>

</aside>
<p>there is water, just not in liquid form</p>
<p>0C would make no sense… cuz then it would be liquid</p>
