        <p>Since the 6th grade I’ve loved this <span class="bbcode-b">one</span> girl. I could talk to other girls but not her. I was to “scared” to talk to her. Well I’m not in 6th grade any more and shes in 1 of my classes. Over the summer I had matured (don’t flame) and still didn’t talk to her. One day, my email was getting spammed too much. So i changed the name. I went to school and went up to girls and said “hey ladies, if your lucky you can have my email” and it worked, so now i have emails. My friend sent everyone to add me. Well that one girl was one of them. No joke, so now i had her email. So I started emailing each other and stuff. Well I got a cell phone a day later she added me and i told her my number. We texted and texted…now we started talking about funny romance crap (whats boys don’t like) and then she texted me “do you like me?” Well, I’m no liar, but tried getting away from the question. It failed and I said i loved her. Then she started to say I have a great personality…Etc,. Now she is a “slut” because the people she dates she fells sorry for them or likes them (rare occasion she likes them). So I started talking to her at school, and now I could TALK TO HER. Well, from there, it went down hill. This girl named heather was going out with this boy named collin. Heather broke up with Collin but Collin still loves heather. So Collin goes and asked out the girl I like to get Heather jealous.<br>
She dosen’t know this though. I have recently stopped texting her alot. I love her, but shes getting used and is going out.<br>
What the hell am i suppose to do now?<br>
Well i thought i would just wait intil they break up or my friends told me to go up to her and tell her your fellings.<br>
Any help?</p>
<p>EDIT: Valentimes day is coming, I’ll send her a note or something.</p>

I understand love.<br>
I feel [at the moment] that you are making a horrible mistake caring for anyone or thing, as it usually just comes and stabs you, twisting the knife.</p>
<p>But on topic, more important than your want to be with her is the truth. Tell her whats going on, but even if she hates you, you did what you had to, because <span class="bbcode-b">you love her</span> and when someone truly knows love they’d do anything to make sure the one that is at the receiving end of said love was not being tricked or lied to.<br>
Besides, chances are she won’t hate you. She’ll probably love you more. Most people seem lucky like that.</p>

You should first ask her about it, but don’t seem to pushy, chances are it will annoy her.<br>
Also, does she really know the real you? That is very important, it will make her trust you more… usually… it probably will for you.<br>

thats the thing. We just started hanging out with each other of the beggening of the this week. I was thinking of waiting a month and getting to know each other better.[/quote]<br>
That’s a good idea, but will it be too late then?</p>

nope, probaly right timing. She wanted me to hand out with her after classes before collin came. When she breaks up with him, it might be 3 weeks, but surely it will happen. I flirt with her anyways.</p>

<p>Anyway, if I were you, I would just tell her how I feel, be careful how you do it though. You don’t really have a lot to lose and it seems like she likes you (or at least she used to). It also seems like she needs to start hanging out with a better people. You should probably start by telling her that you a little concerned about her, as a friend.
