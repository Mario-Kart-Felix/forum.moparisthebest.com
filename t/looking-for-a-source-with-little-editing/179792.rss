    <title>Looking for a source with little editing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-source-with-little-editing/179792</link>
    <description>Hi there, I&#39;ve been looking for a source lately that doesn&#39;t really have much editing done to it(fast exp, custom shops, portals, etc), but I can&#39;t seem to find one.  If someone could point me in the right direction that would be great.

If possible it would be nice if the source already had skills/items(like godswords)/special bar working.</description>
