    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/co-owner-on-my-server-if-you-can-help/191101</link>
    <description>ok well i port forwarded to my ip and everything and downloaded the no-ip duc and it still doesnt let anyone on. i dont get it at all and im a noob with routers :(.

i am using a netgear rp416 v3  and on windows 2000 so i dont have to open the port in my firewall settings right?

ok so i made the services RSPS starting port 43594 and ending 43594 heres a pic of what options i get when i click add custom service
