    <description>Some people have requested that I upload my latest source for download. So, I have finally had time to clean things up and upload parts of it to GitHub. Although I apparently destroyed some parts of it while cleaning it up, the most of it still works. However, do not expect to be able to play on the server, as, like I said, this release contains only parts of RSC4J. I still have to clean other parts up, before releasing them to the public.

You can find it on my GitHub account: https://github.com/WavePropagation

The projects that are used by RSC4J on that GitHub account, are sub-projects of AMF4J and RSC4J, with the two additions Macroing Common and Macroing Configuration.

Edit: In the future, I might aswell update my website for RSC4J. It can be found at: http://www.rsc4j.org

---

Update @ 2014-06-03: A new release has been made to GitHub. This time it is a project in which you can manage your world servers.</description>

Why do you keep ignoring my actual questions and use ad hominem attacks to try and berate me?  I’m not taking ``my first compsci class,’’ I’ve been at this for too many years frankly.  YOU are the one sounding ignorant and asshole-ish.  You never answer the question, just berate.  I want to learn why you think my code is not necessary and you will not answer even though you state it is unnecessary.  Answer it already…</p>

              <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:46, topic:543573”]I’m not really sure why there’s a circlejerk going on between object and Zlacki. I’ve just looked at Zlacki’s OpenRSCD project. It’s written in C++, sure, but it’s largely a port of Java code. And Java code does not make for good C++ code, not by a long shot.<br>
Further, it’s pretty clear that you don’t have a firm grasp of memory management in C++. It’s obvious that you’ve determined that shared_ptr’s are somewhat analogous to Java’s object references but you’re still mixing in pointers anyway. You don’t understand automatic variables within the bigger picture that includes scope and copy and move semantics. As a consequence you end up with this weird code that uses heap memory when it doesn’t need to.<br>
Example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">std::shared_ptr&lt;Region&gt; *neighbours = new std::shared_ptr&lt;Region&gt;[4];
return neighbours;

auto list = regionManager-&gt;getViewablePlayers(owner);
delete list;</code></pre>
<p>Consequently, I don’t think you really have the qualification or credibility to make statements like these:</p>

<p>Ya but the performance loss is negligible.</p>

<p>It’s no wonder you do not make good code, ever.</p>

</aside>

</aside>
<p>The idea is to make it as clear and readable for the reader of the code, not the computer. <em>snip</em> Alas, these words will not phase him and he will claim I am the one who is incompetent, but <code>Keep It Simple Stupid' is not just a UNIX philosophy, it's a universal programming philosophy to avoid bugs. *snip* People in this community may realize it as they move away from Java, but even then I feel they may make it unreadable just for the sake of</code>HOLY COW I’M GOING SO FAST VROOM VROOM’<br>
[/quote][/quote]</p>
<p>What point are you making exactly? More importantly, how was Zlacki’s comment any of your business to begin with? As if though it’s not hard for someone to find a random repository and nitpick a random piece of code with a language that they’re not an expert in and judge them for it. All you did manage to prove was that you’re an ass who interjects with meaningless bullshit unless it benefits your inflated ego.</p>

<p>I’m judging based on personal views, yes.  I was hoping he’d ask why and not get adversarial about the situation so I could explain why I dislike his pathology when it comes to programming.  You’re doing the same, but when I ask why, you’re not assisting just pointing out what you disagree with.  Again, my code works, it is not bug ridden, it doesn’t even suffer from NIH.  I don’t see how it’s NOT KISS.  But, if you can explain why that snippet is bad, and provide a better alternative, I’d really appreciate it.  It works, it does not leak memory, I don’t see the problem personally and would LOVE assistance man.  See where I’m coming from?  I’m not being mean when I say he writes bad code due to too much focus on efficiency, that is advice to focus on fixing bugs.  I would elaborate if he asks.</p>

As a consequence you end up with this weird code that uses heap memory when it doesn’t need to.<br>
Example:</p>

I never intended it to be good code; I’m using it as a learning tool and this was the consequent idea behind releasing it under the license I had.  Does this make sense?<br>
Yes, C++ memory management is very new to me.  I’m mainly a C programmer, think procedurally, not object-oriented much at all.  Hell, the RSClassic client instilled this philosophy in me, really.  No, I don’t find anything between the languages analogous to each other.  Realize why?  They ARE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.  I’m not trying to be mean here, I’m just stating in plain English my motives.  Hope you understand.<br>
The concept of a circlejerk is just a sociopathic concept in nature, it’s the internet; get used to it or don’t use it.</p>
<p>I’ll also add this to the end here, for you, echoing myself: Computers interpret different things in one language in very similar ways.  My code works as expected, and this was my goal.  It has no memory leaks according to Valgrind, which I use religiously on any native code projects that aren’t garbage collected.  I don’t see the issue here, as the code IS for myself, and I had learned by studying other code, as I have learned all of my computer language knowledge.</p>
<p>Again, if you have a huge problem with my code, PLEASE HELP ME.  Do not just criticize in vague ways as you have, it’s unhelpful criticism, you should know this.</p>

<p>This is why I’ve always respected you as a programmer :P.<br>
You may recall back in my StorkPK running days, I’d tried to utilize RSCDEF.  I ran into problems with concurrency when trying to update players, similar things, but at the same time this is a cost of the threading model used in it.  I eventually decided, yea most code I don’t write I won’t like, and that’s when I started my C++ OpenRSCD project with the INTENT of people helping with it.  Nobody is haha, but I’ll get around to completing it soon I’ve been busy working as you say, it’s not pleasant but if it gets the job done the customer is usually pleased.
