    <title>Need help with a huge problem</title>

    <description>     I&#39;ve been working on something for quite a few days and I can&#39;t quite figure out how to get it working correctly. What I&#39;ve been trying to do is make respawning flax that deletes and respawns after a given amount of time. The method for deleting the object checks the x and y coords using objectX and objectY so all the objects delete without a problem. But each object would need it&#39;s own timer to respawn at different times. So what I did was use an array that increases every time the object is clicked. I set a few integers to help this work the right way but my problem is a bit hard to explain.

First I set my integers.
[code]public int[] flaxtimer2 = new int[100];
public int[] objectx2 = new int[100];
public int[] objecty2 = new int[100];
public int thisint = 0;[/code]

Than I made my case for the flax object.
[code]case 2646:
thisint++; &lt;&lt; Increases by 1 every time the object is clicked.
flaxtimer2[thisint] = 60; &lt;&lt; The timer using an array is used.
ReplaceObject2(objectX, objectY, 6951, -1, 10); &lt;&lt; Object is replaced.
objectx2[thisint] = objectX; &lt;&lt; Used these integers to mark the exact coordinates of objects for later use.
objecty2[thisint] = objectY; &lt;&lt; ^
break;[/code]

And the last thing I did was process the timers.
[code]Than I needed to process the timer and here&#39;s where my problem comes into play.
if(flaxtimer2[thisint] &gt; 0) { &lt;&lt; Checks if the timer is greater than 0.
flaxtimer2[thisint]--; &lt;&lt; Timer decreases.
}
if(flaxtimer2[thisint] == 5) { &lt;&lt; If the timer is equal to 5 the object respawns.
ReplaceObject2(objectx2[thisint], objecty2[thisint], 2646,-1, 10); &lt;&lt; Respawns flax.
}[/code]

This would work if you only clicked one object in 30 seconds. If you clicked 2 objects within 30 seconds it respawns the last object you clicked. This happens becuase the integer &quot;thisint&quot; changes everytime you click the object. That&#39;s the problem I run into. I have no idea what I could do to make this work correctly. If you could help me I&#39;d be very thankful. Thanks for reading, hopefully you have a solution. Any solution(even if it won&#39;t work) is better than none.</description>

<p>This would work if you only clicked one object in 30 seconds. If you clicked 2 objects within 30 seconds it respawns the last object you clicked. This happens becuase the integer “thisint” changes everytime you click the object. That’s the problem I run into. I have no idea what I could do to make this work correctly. If you could help me I’d be very thankful. Thanks for reading, hopefully you have a solution. Any solution(even if it won’t work) is better than none.</p>
