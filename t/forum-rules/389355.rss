Shouldn&#39;t it be:

<p>That is a very valid point right there. I actually thank you for pointing that out, as now that I look back I have been judgmental on other users because of their grammar, and it turned out they spoke fluent French or German. Again I thank you for that.</p>

              <p>Just a pet peeve of mine. I understand if you don’t think it was necessary, and I wouldn’t object to you either. I always thought grammar and vocabulary shows who a person is, and in this sense the community. I know you aren’t supposed to “judge the book by its cover”, but it does show a lot about who a person is. I know this community is, for the most part, intelligent. Sorry if I annoyed you in any way.</p>
