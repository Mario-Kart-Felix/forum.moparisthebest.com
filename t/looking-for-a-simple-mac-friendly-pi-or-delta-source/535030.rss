    <title>Looking for a simple mac friendly PI or Delta source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-simple-mac-friendly-pi-or-delta-source/535030</link>
    <description>Im running eclipse IDE and every source I have ever ran has tons and tons of errors. I have only found 1 that has worked successfully and that was only because the was a JAGGRAB integrated. I don&#39;t care about all the fancy stuff. Main points are simply stability and Working skills. The skills can be simple but I would like them to at least be there. Other than that, any mac friendly PI or Delta source will make me happy lol.

THank you</description>
