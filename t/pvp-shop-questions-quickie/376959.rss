    <title>PVP Shop Questions - Quickie</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pvp-shop-questions-quickie/376959</link>
    <description>I have been looking around and found no tutorials for a PVP shop and PVP Points for PI. I have made a PVP shop but I do not know how to make it so players earn points on a pvp kill and pay pvp points for the items.


If you could please explain below or link me(post here or msg) to a tutorial. That would be great!

Thanks!</description>
