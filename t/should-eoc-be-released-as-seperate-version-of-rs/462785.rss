    <title>Should EOC be released as seperate version of RS?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-eoc-be-released-as-seperate-version-of-rs/462785</link>
    <description>What do you think? Should Jagex release EOC as different version and keep the old version, similar how they did it with RSC?</description>

              <p>Yes, it should. I stopped playing RS awhile ago because of how much they changed it. EOC will ruin RS because it doesn’t fit the game.</p>

Slightly related: I haven’t played much in a long time. Why exactly is everyone so upset about EoC? I played it for a bit and thought it was awesome, but it seems the majority of the community hates it. Why is this?<br>

<p>People hate change. IMO, It’s a lot of effort for pretty much not a lot. There are other ways to make it possible for what they want to do without changing the main core of combat. (new bosses etc)[/quote]</p>
<p>People are fucking stupid. If life changes why can’t a game?</p>

I believe they should wait for EoC to be released with RS3. Not only will it complement the new RuneScape well, but you could keep the old combat for those players that are stubborn on like 2 servers for RS2. Same deal from classic -&gt; RS2.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Jagex will never make the mistake of calling a game RS3 nor will they make the same mistake they did with keeping classic open again.[/quote]<br>
Well MMG said “The project name is RS3 but what we end up calling it is yet to be seen.” And I just read the transcript about the future of RuneScape, and it seems you are right. They have no plans on keeping RS2 on a few servers like classic because they feel that the majority of the changes they are making are wanted. Here’s a whole quote on the matter.</p>
<p>"1. If the Evolution of Combat is not RS3, what are the major marks or distinctions of RS3?</p>
<p>MMG: The project name is RS3 but what we end up calling it is yet to be seen. We’re trying to bundle together our most formidable update that we’ve ever done both technically, be that graphics or audio, controller input, the full works as well as also some really compelling content. Clearly, the Evolution of Combat (EoC) is a big step forward towards what we’re trying to do but we’re also hoping to have some really interesting and innovative content too that we haven’t spoken about yet and we think that our players will really appreciate.</p>
<p>Mark: We’re really looking for an improved experience for the players, so we’re talking about updated audio, full tunes. I listened to an absolutely amazing few tracks the other day. New tunes for the website, new tunes for the opening experience of the game. We’re also looking at a new top level interface, so new ways for players to interact with the product and also things like an improved world map. It’s really improving those things that you experience and take for granted every day when you’re playing RuneScape. As Mark says, we’re also looking for some really cool pieces of content to put alongside that. I’m keeping my cards a bit close to my chest, really, in terms of what we’ve got planned. 2013 is going to be a massive year for RuneScape. There’s going to be some really, really big things happening from a storytelling perspective and also the game play of RuneScape. From all the years I’ve been here, I’ve never been so excited about a year’s worth of content. RuneScape 3 is just the tip of the iceberg. It’s what we’re going to start with and then you’ll see all the cool stuff that we’ve got planned for the rest of the year. "</p>
