&lt;blockquote&gt;Users submit queries and computation requests via a text field. Wolfram|Alpha then computes answers and relevant visualizations from a knowledge base of curated, structured data. Alpha thus differs from semantic search engines, which index a large number of answers and then try to match the question to one.

Wolfram|Alpha is built on Wolfram&#39;s earlier flagship product, Mathematica, which encompasses computer algebra, symbolic and numerical computation, visualization, and statistics capabilities. With Mathematica running in the background, it is suited to answer mathematical questions. The answer usually presents a human-readable solution.

Example: &quot;lim(x-&gt;0) x/sin x&quot; yields the expected result, 1, a plot, and the series expansion. The button &quot;show steps&quot; provides a possible derivation of the result using L&#39;Hôpital&#39;s rule.

Example: &quot;lim sin x/x/cos(x), x-&gt;infty&quot; is correctly interpreted as  The answer given is 0 in spite of the fact that the limit does not exist.


However, Wolfram|Alpha is also capable of responding to natural-language fact-based questions such as &quot;Where was Mary Robinson born?&quot; or more complex questions such as &quot;How old was Queen Elizabeth II in 1974?&quot; It displays its &quot;Input interpretation&quot; of such a question, using standardized phrases, e.g. &quot;Mary Robinson | place of birth&quot; or &quot;age | of Queen Elizabeth II (royalty) | in 1974&quot;.


It is also capable of performing calculations on data using more than one source:

Example: &quot;What is the fifty-second smallest country by GDP per capita?&quot; yields India, $725.76 per year.

Wolfram|Alpha makes inferences from a smaller set of core information. In this way it has many parallels with Cyc, a project aimed since the 1980s at developing a common-sense inference engine.
The database currently includes hundreds of datasets, such as &#39;All Current and Historical Weather&#39;. The datasets have been accumulated over approximately two years, and will continue to grow. The range of questions that can be answered will grow with the expansion of the datasets.[4]&lt;/blockquote&gt;




------
Some information i managed to figure out :P

I have lived for 160 611 hours

The day i was born the duration of daylight in Norway was 8 hours and 32 minutes

Survival probability in Norway:
living past age 10 | 99.56%
living past age 20 | 99.34%
living past age 30 | 98.73%
living past age 40 | 97.96%
living past age 50 | 96.41%
living past age 60 | 92.56%
living past age 70 | 83.45%
living past age 80 | 62.7%
living past age 90 | 23.89%
living past age 100 | 1.21%


dying before age 10 | 0.443%
dying before age 20 | 0.661%
dying before age 30 | 1.27%
dying before age 40 | 2.04%
dying before age 50 | 3.59%
dying before age 60 | 7.45%
dying before age 70 | 16.55%
dying before age 80 | 37.3%
dying before age 90 | 76.11%
dying before age 100 | 98.79%


Post some of the random information you manage to find out.</description>
