<p>Tip: most game developers don’t create their own games from scratch, they use libraries.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, yeah, but are we really being that picky here? Of course a Notch didn’t <span class="bbcode-i">technically</span> write the Minecraft engine from scratch because yes, he used a number of Java libraries, but wouldn’t you at least say it’s more-so impressive than using a Unity engine? I would argue that it is.<br>
[/quote]I don’t know the extent of Unity engine or the extent of the Java Open Game Library, so I don’t know. Did Notch write his own physics? If not, then no it’s not really more impressive than using Unity, especially when you consider how bad Notch’s code was before he hired someone else to rewrite it for him. But what is your point anyway? They are both engines, and the scale to which you use them and expand on them is completely up to the game. He could have made something equally impressive in unity. Because again, a lot about it is the design, not the coding part. He created a game that was popular because it was a good game, not because he was good at coding.[/quote]<br>
At the very least I would argue that Notch is a competent programmer. And when you say “someone rewrite it for him”, you aren’t referring to Jeb are you? Because Jeb was a programmer prior to taking things over, and to my knowledge, he merely expanded on Notch’s system and didn’t entirely rewrite. Could be wrong or missing something here as I’ve been aloof towards the Minecraft community for a number of years now, but case in point I think that Notch’s programming is at <span class="bbcode-i">least</span> adequate.</p>
<p>And I have no idea if Notch wrote his own physics, but that wasn’t exactly where I was going with it; I didn’t mean to fixate so much on Notch, sorry if it came off that way. I was more talking about the feeling of satisfaction, or at least how impressive a programming job is. I’m going to use Notch as an example again, if I may. At lot of his philosophy on games isn’t so much about making a flawless production; sure, we can point to games like Bethesda and say “Wow, what professional and flawless (arguable) quality their games have!” but to me or to Notch, that isn’t what it’s all about. He said that he loved the game development community because he loved making games <span class="bbcode-u">for the sake of making games</span>. The level of satisfaction you get after you can point to something you made without the help of an external engine.</p>
<p>To me, I’d much rather make semi-successful indie-games that I programmed from scratch for the rest of my life rather than work at a large development company and just worry about a flawless production. We’re obviously entering areas of pure opinion and subjectivity at this point, but I just feel passionate about this as someone who lives and breathes gaming.</p>
<p>I know I’m struggling to be articulate here, but do you get what I’m saying?</p>

You can learn and use libraries at the same time (any time you use a library method, study the concept maybe, idunno). One of the major flaws in your thinking (which admittedly I had as well when I first did some game development) is that using a library means you aren’t doing work. It’s true that some libraries are like that, but I honestly think you just haven’t even looked at an engine to see what exactly it does. You still have to do a lot of your own work, and I’m not just talking about content development.<br>
Take a look at this, does it seem simple and easy and all done for you?<br>

And secondly, they wouldnt necessarily be impressed with a game engine from scratch, unless the engine had some ingenuity or was written very well. At that point they may even laugh at you and say 'haha they wasted so much time rewriting this shit without even creating anything new'.

I do agree with a lot of what you said here. I haven’t really looked into what this guy has been saying, but if he has said what you quoted, then of course I’d say he’s just going through an attention phase of some sort, and believe me I am not naive to the abundance of people that are like that in the computer world, but there are exceptions I feel, and I just wanted to make sure you weren’t entirely against the idea of someone making their own engines.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it is a lot more work writing your own, because like you said, it’s rare you’re introducing something innovative anyways. But to be honest, I really do enjoy the extra work, at least at this point in my life.

I totally know what you mean, everyone gets different satisfaction out of game development. For example, my favorite part is interacting with the community and creating things to suit their needs. However, I’m using the context that Limits wants to become a professional developer so I’m trying to help him understand that his ways of thinking wont get him there.<br>
Specifically:</p>
<p>[quote]OT: I prefer writing everything from scratch because I hate crediting others.<br>
Do you want people to look at your game and go “…oh another game made in Slick2D” or "Shit man, this guys got some talent writing this all by himself.<br>
[/quote]<br>
The first statement is just… well I just hope once he gets a bit older he can get over that one. The second one is the main thing I am trying to argue against. Both parts of it are inaccurate. People in the game dev industry understand how important libraries/engines are and would never be like “ppffttt, he used an engine, what a noob.” And secondly, they wouldnt necessarily be impressed with a game engine from scratch, unless the engine had some ingenuity or was written very well. At that point they may even laugh at you and say ‘haha they wasted so much time rewriting this shit without even creating anything new’.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I do agree with a lot of what you said here. I haven’t really looked into what this guy has been saying, but if he has said what you quoted, then of course I’d say he’s just going through an attention phase of some sort, and believe me I am not naive to the abundance of people that are like that in the computer world, but there are exceptions I feel, and I just wanted to make sure you weren’t entirely against the idea of someone making their own engines.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it is a lot more work writing your own, because like you said, it’s rare you’re introducing something innovative anyways. But to be honest, I really do enjoy the extra work, at least at this point in my life. I’ll be a freshman majoring in computer science this fall, so I’m currently at a stage where nearly everything in the field fascinates me, and I don’t mind doing the extra work as long as it satisfies my curiosity. But of course there’s always those doing it for pretentious reasons as well.[/quote]<br>
Yep dat quote was all mine. It’s more of a self confidence thing. I’m going through the awkward teenager phase and well, doing things, no matter how redundant the task is helps boost the old self confidence because you know you can do something most people around you cant <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
