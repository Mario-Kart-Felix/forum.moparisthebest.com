    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/game-engine-or-from-scratch/545258</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m going to attempt to make a 2d game, and I wanted to know if you think I should use a game engine(Slick2d is what I had in mind) or start from scratch. I can manage either, I would just like some opinions.</description>

I totally know what you mean, everyone gets different satisfaction out of game development. For example, my favorite part is interacting with the community and creating things to suit their needs. However, I’m using the context that Limits wants to become a professional developer so I’m trying to help him understand that his ways of thinking wont get him there.<br>
Specifically:</p>
<p>[quote]OT: I prefer writing everything from scratch because I hate crediting others.<br>
Do you want people to look at your game and go “…oh another game made in Slick2D” or "Shit man, this guys got some talent writing this all by himself.<br>
[/quote]<br>
The first statement is just… well I just hope once he gets a bit older he can get over that one. The second one is the main thing I am trying to argue against. Both parts of it are inaccurate. People in the game dev industry understand how important libraries/engines are and would never be like “ppffttt, he used an engine, what a noob.” And secondly, they wouldnt necessarily be impressed with a game engine from scratch, unless the engine had some ingenuity or was written very well. At that point they may even laugh at you and say ‘haha they wasted so much time rewriting this shit without even creating anything new’.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I do agree with a lot of what you said here. I haven’t really looked into what this guy has been saying, but if he has said what you quoted, then of course I’d say he’s just going through an attention phase of some sort, and believe me I am not naive to the abundance of people that are like that in the computer world, but there are exceptions I feel, and I just wanted to make sure you weren’t entirely against the idea of someone making their own engines.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it is a lot more work writing your own, because like you said, it’s rare you’re introducing something innovative anyways. But to be honest, I really do enjoy the extra work, at least at this point in my life. I’ll be a freshman majoring in computer science this fall, so I’m currently at a stage where nearly everything in the field fascinates me, and I don’t mind doing the extra work as long as it satisfies my curiosity. But of course there’s always those doing it for pretentious reasons as well.[/quote]<br>

You can learn and use libraries at the same time (any time you use a library method, study the concept maybe, idunno). One of the major flaws in your thinking (which admittedly I had as well when I first did some game development) is that using a library means you aren’t doing work. It’s true that some libraries are like that, but I honestly think you just haven’t even looked at an engine to see what exactly it does. You still have to do a lot of your own work, and I’m not just talking about content development.<br>

<p>Tip: most game developers don’t create their own games from scratch, they use libraries.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well, yeah, but are we really being that picky here? Of course a Notch didn’t <span class="bbcode-i">technically</span> write the Minecraft engine from scratch because yes, he used a number of Java libraries, but wouldn’t you at least say it’s more-so impressive than using a Unity engine? I would argue that it is.<br>
[/quote]I don’t know the extent of Unity engine or the extent of the Java Open Game Library, so I don’t know. Did Notch write his own physics? If not, then no it’s not really more impressive than using Unity, especially when you consider how bad Notch’s code was before he hired someone else to rewrite it for him. But what is your point anyway? They are both engines, and the scale to which you use them and expand on them is completely up to the game. He could have made something equally impressive in unity. Because again, a lot about it is the design, not the coding part. He created a game that was popular because it was a good game, not because he was good at coding.[/quote]<br>
At the very least I would argue that Notch is a competent programmer. And when you say “someone rewrite it for him”, you aren’t referring to Jeb are you?

Wow! Early congratulations! and the problem with giving me a bit of reality is that you’re giving it to me while I’m still starting learning the basics. I’ve only been coding for maybe a year and I think I’m way too ambitious.</p>

Learning how to develop games is not just about learning to program them. It’s also about time management, and so many other factors that it’s hard to write about. If you look at some of Taharoks posts on the subject you can sorta get an idea on what I mean. You have no idea what you’re doing, so you just assume that to get into the industry you need to learn all of these things and do them alone. You’re much better off having a manageable project that uses libraries than trying to write your own game from scratch. Engines are considered completely different projects than games most of the time, and you’ll often see ‘engine developer’ and ‘game/content designer/developer’ in completely different categories when applying to a gaming company. If you feel like you want to be an engine developer, then you should focus on learning about the engines and how they work. Which again by the way, is in a completely different scope than what you are doing. Learning specifically in Java how to copy what a game developer book says is completely different than learning what engines do, 3d arithmetic, physics etc, you can do all of that outside of a game project. Honestly your attitude towards development just sucks in general, and you will not succeed with it. Are you still refusing to use an IDE?<br>

I understand that videogames have deadlines to meet so that their technology doesnt get surpassed by others, and I’ll adapt to that later.

Development is a very cooperative task in almost every instance, even with people not working on the same project. If you can’t accept some people might have more experience in something (this is me reflecting on what Taharok has said by the way, my own experience is somewhat limited, however I did make some of the same mistakes you did) and listen to what they have to say you are just going to peter/burn out. But by all means, if you want to be self destructive, be my guest, you obviously do not want help.</p>

Tip: most game developers don’t create their own games from scratch, they use libraries.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Well, yeah, but are we really being that picky here? Of course a Notch didn’t <span class="bbcode-i">technically</span> write the Minecraft engine from scratch because yes, he used a number of Java libraries, but wouldn’t you at least say it’s more-so impressive than using a Unity engine? I would argue that it is.[/quote]I don’t know the extent of Unity engine or the extent of the Java Open Game Library, so I don’t know. Did Notch write his own physics? If not, then no it’s not really more impressive than using Unity, especially when you consider how bad Notch’s code was before he hired someone else to rewrite it for him. But what is your point anyway? They are both engines, and the scale to which you use them and expand on them is completely up to the game. He could have made something equally impressive in unity. Because again, a lot about it is the design, not the coding part. He created a game that was popular because it was a good game, not because he was good at coding.</p>

<p>Edit: I agree with your most recent post though (didn’t see it until now). Sure there are a lot of different fields of game development, but I was just speaking of game development in a general sense, as in, coding a game “from scratch”. And it is DEFINITELY necessary to use an IDE. That is an opinion of no one, just fact.</p>

<p>You’re going deeper than me. I like to use what Java gave me. Not anything anyone else made using java.<br>

<p>A book that teaches me how to use java to make games. It doesnt use external libs.<br>
[/quote]I guess I just don’t see the logic. It sounds like you dont want to use external libs because you feel like it isnt your work, but reading from a book and doing exactly what it tells you to do is pretty much the exact same thing. The only logic that actually makes sense would be if you were doing it for educational purposes to specifically try and learn how those work…[/quote]<br>
I guess im a bit confusing sorry :P. I’m reading from a book to understand how 3D videogames work since i want to become a game developer when I get older. It’s pretty hard to understand at 15 years of age, I dont know how u guys do it</p>
