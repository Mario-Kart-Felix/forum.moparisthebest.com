I think re-inventing the wheel is a good way to learn things properly and so you can actually understand how things operate on “deeper” level, which is the main reason people do it. If you think you can pull it off and not quit, do it. it will be worth your time.</p>

<p>It’s not really about redoing something already done, it’s about specification and customization. Specification as in making your engine for your game style only and nothing more and customizing the way everything is done to your liking.[/quote]</p>
<p>You have to look at time efficiency, time constraints and how much extra work you’re doing that isn’t required. The wheel you’re using has generally been battle tested and is written a lot better than what most standard game devs could manage. So if his goal is to create his own game, it’s pretty obvious which route is the more efficient one of the two. Considering one of the biggest stumbling blocks is underestimating the work required to actually create something, this hugely decreases the pain that the developer will feel. Not to mention, there are some great engines and libraries out there that will do what OP wants.</p>
<p>If it’s a learning experience that’s desired, then sure. Go write your own engine. That’s not what the OP wanted though. I assume from what he has posted, that he wants to be able to implement the game ideas as easily as possible. There’s certainly enough room allowed for customization and optimisation there without having to build everything yourself. Everyone uses existing code because it’s logical. It doesn’t make you less of a developer, lazy or terrible at your job. It’s just the better way of doing something.</p>
<p>I stand by what I said. There’s nothing wrong with using existing libraries. Reinventing the wheel when you’re aiming for efficiency (time) is idiotic and understanding your goals/constraints is vital.  If it’s for learning purposes, then go write your own. I agree with that part. It’s all good to throw around ego and claim that you’re developing your own engine, but you start to realise how silly that is if you’re working on a large project. Don’t make life more difficult on yourself.</p>
<p>There’s a nice article on this: <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AlanThorn/20140328/214178/Is_it_cheating_to_use_a_game_engine.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AlanThorn/20140328/214178/Is_it_cheating_to_use_a_game_engine.php</a></p>

I guess im a bit confusing sorry :P. I’m reading from a book to understand how 3D videogames work since i want to become a game developer when I get older. It’s pretty hard to understand at 15 years of age, I dont know how u guys do it</p>

        <p>Learning how to develop games is not just about learning to program them. It’s also about time management, and so many other factors that it’s hard to write about. If you look at some of Taharoks posts on the subject you can sorta get an idea on what I mean. You have no idea what you’re doing, so you just assume that to get into the industry you need to learn all of these things and do them alone. You’re much better off having a manageable project that uses libraries than trying to write your own game from scratch. Engines are considered completely different projects than games most of the time, and you’ll often see ‘engine developer’ and ‘game/content designer/developer’ in completely different categories when applying to a gaming company. If you feel like you want to be an engine developer, then you should focus on learning about the engines and how they work. Which again by the way, is in a completely different scope than what you are doing. Learning specifically in Java how to copy what a game developer book says is completely different than learning what engines do, 3d arithmetic, physics etc, you can do all of that outside of a game project. Honestly your attitude towards development just sucks in general, and you will not succeed with it. Are you still refusing to use an IDE?</p>

<p>Well, yeah, but are we really being that picky here? Of course a Notch didn’t <span class="bbcode-i">technically</span> write the Minecraft engine from scratch because yes, he used a number of Java libraries, but wouldn’t you at least say it’s more-so impressive than using a Unity engine? I would argue that it is.</p>
<p>Edit: I agree with your most recent post though (didn’t see it until now). Sure there are a lot of different fields of game development, but I was just speaking of game development in a general sense, as in, coding a game “from scratch”. And it is DEFINITELY necessary to use an IDE. That is an opinion of no one, just fact.</p>

I would argue that it is.[/quote]I don’t know the extent of Unity engine or the extent of the Java Open Game Library, so I don’t know. Did Notch write his own physics? If not, then no it’s not really more impressive than using Unity, especially when you consider how bad Notch’s code was before he hired someone else to rewrite it for him. But what is your point anyway? They are both engines, and the scale to which you use them and expand on them is completely up to the game. He could have made something equally impressive in unity. Because again, a lot about it is the design, not the coding part. He created a game that was popular because it was a good game, not because he was good at coding.</p>

<p>Learning how to develop games is not just about learning to program them. It’s also about time management, and so many other factors that it’s hard to write about. If you look at some of Taharoks posts on the subject you can sorta get an idea on what I mean. You have no idea what you’re doing, so you just assume that to get into the industry you need to learn all of these things and do them alone. You’re much better off having a manageable project that uses libraries than trying to write your own game from scratch. Engines are considered completely different projects than games most of the time, and you’ll often see ‘engine developer’ and ‘game/content designer/developer’ in completely different categories when applying to a gaming company. If you feel like you want to be an engine developer, then you should focus on learning about the engines and how they work. Which again by the way, is in a completely different scope than what you are doing. Learning specifically in Java how to copy what a game developer book says is completely different than learning what engines do, 3d arithmetic, physics etc, you can do all of that outside of a game project. Honestly your attitude towards development just sucks in general, and you will not succeed with it. Are you still refusing to use an IDE?</p>

<p>I’d love to write content but I’d love it even more if I knew what I was writing content on top of, whether I wrote it or not. Like I’d love decorating the rooms in my house but I’d love it even more if I knew how the house was built or if I build it myself. I understand that videogames have deadlines to meet so that their technology doesnt get surpassed by others, and I’ll adapt to that later. I have lots of time right now and I’m sitting down and learning how this shit all works. Also, if you dont like how I get shit done, then get off my back and let me do things the way I want.</p>

We’re trying to help you by giving you a bit of reality and you just seem to think your way is the best way. That type of attitude is not going to get you far in this field. Development is a very cooperative task in almost every instance, even with people not working on the same project. If you can’t accept some people might have more experience in something (this is me reflecting on what Taharok has said by the way, my own experience is somewhat limited, however I did make some of the same mistakes you did) and listen to what they have to say you are just going to peter/burn out. But by all means, if you want to be self destructive, be my guest, you obviously do not want help.</p>

Are you in the game development industry David?[/quote]As a mater of fact I am a bit less than two years away from my degree, but as I said in my edit a lot of what I am saying is based on what Taharok has said, who was at digipen (a very specifically targeted game development college), and has created many games at his time there.</p>
