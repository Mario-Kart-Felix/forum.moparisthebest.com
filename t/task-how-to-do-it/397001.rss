    <title>Task: How to do it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/task-how-to-do-it/397001</link>
    <description>Hey,

at my research i am biasing voltage and incrementally changing it by factor of 2, now here is the problem, since i am using Electrostatic Force Microscopy (EFM), each image takes about 30mins to render, i just don&#39;t want to be sitting there waiting for it, since the lab is in the basement and i don&#39;t want to be there the whole day, i do about 12 pictures, so thats about 6h. I want to automate it, so this is what i am trying to do is after each scan, i want the automation to go and change the value, and click on capture, now the thing i am not so sure how to do is that how will i make it detect if the picture has been taken, since if a picture  (composed of 3 vectors) taken a  new file will be created in C:/capture. anyone know a way, it&#39;d be good in java, python or C++, i guess java would be good since i want to make a GUI, so other&#39;s in the group can easily use it on different machines.</description>

              <p>If you need it to type and click on a GUI, then the easiest, quickest way to automate it would be to use something like Simba to do it.</p>
<p>Of course, the best way is if you could automate it from the command line with a script or something.</p>
