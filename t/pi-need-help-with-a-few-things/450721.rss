    <title>[PI] Need help with a few things</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-need-help-with-a-few-things/450721</link>
    <description>1. I need to disable fight pits since they are allowed to dupe with it. How can I do that?

2. How can I an NPC and have him teleport you to MULTIPLE places?

3. When a player follows somebody, the follower can go through walls and stuff as the leader runs.
Also, how can I make it so that they don&#39;t attack each other diagonally?</description>

For the first one: You can simply disable the portal to enter the fight pits. In that way they can’t enter it nor play it. Search in your object handler for the right id (fight pits portal id) and put // in front of every line that belongs to that object. the // will make it so that the compiler won’t ‘read’ this code and won’t add it. To re-add it just remove the // in front of the code lines.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For the second: Add a choice dialogue to your npc so they can choose between “falador”,“varrock”,“lumbridge” etc.</p>
