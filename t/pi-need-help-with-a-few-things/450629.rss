    <title>[PI] Need help with a few things</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-need-help-with-a-few-things/450629</link>
    <description>1. I need to disable fight pits since they are allowed to dupe with it. How can I do that?

2. How can I add objects, such as a portal, to the ground and make it so when I click on it, it has dialogue for multiple places?
OR IF YOU know how to make it so you can do the same through NPC?

3. When a player follows somebody, the follower can go through walls and stuff as the leader runs.
Also, how can I make it so that they don&#39;t attack each other diagonally?</description>
