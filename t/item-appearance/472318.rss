    <description>Hello, I&#39;m very new at this, and am experimenting with changes, adding commands, etc. on a source/client I downloaded (Zenithscape). I was trying to find a command for switching the item appearances to the older versions, before the armor update, and learned that &quot;switchitemslook&quot; switches them, however this didn&#39;t work, I looked at the code and it called methods in the player class like player.switchitemslook(), I looked in my Player.java and the method wasn&#39;t even there. Could someone please explain how to switch the items to &quot;old&quot; look (how would I go about writing the missing method on my own) or just post code from another source that has this command, so I could see how they do it and add it to mine? Thanks in advance.</description>

Thanks I’ll try changing the model ID. Not sure if my cache even contains the other models.<br>

Assuming you have the new, it has the old. It’s cache packed.[/quote]<br>
Oh, thanks. Which files would need to have the model ID changed on the client side? I’ve found most of the client files are quite difficult to understand with variable names like anIntArray1918[] etc. Is there a specific place where the model might be defined or would the command need to search through in a lot of different places and change each one?</p>

<p>You’d have to write a client sided command that changes what model ID is loaded. You’d also need to have both models in the cache.</p>
