    <description>Okay so my friend brought his pc to me with a processor he wants me to put in it, I have all the things to do it but I need to know if this processor is compatible with the Motherboard :The one in his pc now is a: &quot;Intel Pentium 4 641&quot; The one he brought me is a &quot;Intel Pentium D&quot; His chipset is a i945g &quot;ECS Livemore&quot; The Pentium D is also a i945g. Will his pc still work after i put the new processor in it? [url=http://prntscr.com/6rtm42]http://prntscr.com/6rtm42[/url]

:Edit: This is the intel Pentium D supported sockets &quot;Sockets Supported	PLGA775&quot;

<p>If the CPU has the same socket as the Motherboard, you’re fine.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thank you, Zymus.</p>
