    <description>You know when your server crashes and you look at your runserver.bat and it says (playername) is already online.  But is says that for everybody but it never stops.  I think I found a fix for that so it automatically resets your server when it happens.  I also think that I found a way to make it do the same thing if it says (playername) can&#39;t log in because there is too many players online.  I&#39;ve yet to actualy test it but I&#39;m pretty sure it works.  After I test it do you guys thing I should make a tutorial on how to add it to your server it if it works?</description>

              <p>Yeah, you should make a tutorial on it. I’ve only seen a couple decent ones lately, but not as if I could do better myself.</p>

I’ve spent all day on it.  I need a bunch of people to sign on my server to test it.  Almost always when there’s a bunch of people it does whoevers already online but it never does the too many players online anymore because I edited the max players to 200 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
