    <title>Making weapon range based</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-weapon-range-based/551640</link>
    <description>So, i have been trying to add toxic blowpipe for awhile now and i managed to do it.

Now, how do i change it to range based? I can figure out the whole dart system myself, that isnt a problem but i have added toxic blowpipe to my bows int[] as a test yet it it still melee based.
