    <description>My second post, try to be nice to me  ;)

Here are some things you require .. A 2 Litre bottle , some dry ice and acess to room temperature water.

First to acquire the stuff. Go down to the supermarket, buy some dry ice and/or preferably a 2 litre water bottle.
Do the below VERY quickly.
If you bought a 2 litre water bottle, empty like 25 mls. Next smash the dry ice into the bottle so it can fit. 
REMEMBER TO SCREW THE LID ON (lol)  :|
Throw somewhere and gap the scenes.
If you didnt buy a 2 litre water bottle, a soda bottle and warm water will do fine.

I have tried this several times and it worked. Me and a friend were experimenting with some stuff and created this.
