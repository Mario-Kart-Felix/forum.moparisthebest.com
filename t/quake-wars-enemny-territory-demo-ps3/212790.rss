    <title>Quake Wars: Enemny Territory Demo(PS3)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quake-wars-enemny-territory-demo-ps3/212790</link>
    <description>Well today i downloaded this from the playstation store and i must say that it is a suprise. When you play the game you are either of the two teams; the strogg or GDF. If you are the GDF you can parachute into the map which is fun, but the Strogg just merely fall from the sky. The health system is quite good, it displays a bar and a number from 1-100. This way you can use either one you wish. With the ammunition you get the same thing, a bar and a number. When you reload the bar goes red and starts to fill up again. Its a nice touch as you know how long it has left to finish reloading. Aiming is good but the crosshair is just a circle which isn&#39;t too bad. Movement across map can be done in vehicles or on foot. Flying is fiddly and i suggest avoiding it all costs, with X to increase altitude and the L stick to move. The L stick also controls the movement in all vehicles. When playing this along side the PC game which is almost identical to this in the way it plays and looks. Personally i would choose to have the PC version because you can tell this game was not designed for a console but for a mouse and keyboard. Turning speeds are fast in the game and you will be better off with a mouse rather than the controllers of the PS3. It is definately a game worth getting but not on the PS3 get the slightly older PC version. Obviously Thug-Life is going to download this and i can&#39;t wait to see what he has to say on the matter</description>
