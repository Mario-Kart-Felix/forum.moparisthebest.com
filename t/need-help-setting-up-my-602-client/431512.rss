    <title>Need help setting up my 602 client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-setting-up-my-602-client/431512</link>
    <description>Hello i have a client from this forum named Uncalled Attack. Its a 602 client and i dont know where the server ip is to change it to my server ip to make the game live.

Any help with that would be helpful. Now its Webclient ready but no client.jar so i assume that i have to jar the files myself, Now im not very good at that either so can someone please help me with that for this 602?

Now on to some questions:
-OK so what do i do with the source?
-Why is there a mysql.jar file?
-Do i have to run the server from the source to get the server online if i upload the client?


Any help would be really appreciated as this is the first rsps i have ever done. I have no-ip and ports done.

The source and client was from this post: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,508789.0.html 

I would like to get that up asap so that i can get on to finishing up with the server and then doing the forums.

Thanks in advance.</description>
