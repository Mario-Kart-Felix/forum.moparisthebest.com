    <title>Increasing your maximum hit!</title>

    <description>Hey!

I&#39;m a new RSPS coder and I&#39;ve been using this forum for a lot of my needs and find that there are some very useful people as well threads on here. My latest inquiry is how to increase your maximum hit. I know it seems awful but I&#39;d think that as owner of you&#39;re server you would be able to 1 hit people in the wilderness with various weapons. I was wondering how can I either increase my maximum hit or increase the strength of a weapon so high that it auto 1 hits. Please and Thanks!</description>

              <p>If you have access to the server files you can edit an item’s strength bonus to lets say 10000, that should one hit anyone. Saying it’s server sided just means it can only be or is coded into the server files, not the client files.</p>

<p>Does that mean there’s no way to change it so that I can 1 hit people in wildly as well as other monsters?</p>
