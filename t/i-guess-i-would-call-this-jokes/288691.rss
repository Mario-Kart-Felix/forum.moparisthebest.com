    <description>[center][size=14pt][u][b]Welcome to Bmaw&#39;s joke thread![/b][/u][/size]

I will be taking the jokes i find funny and posting them below.

Try not to be too racist.

Also please do not flame people if they post shitty jokes or if you don&#39;t like their jokes.

I picked your mom up in the Chinatown District during a Crossfire, and then put her in a Vacant room. We had a Showdown and I put my Bloc Pipeline in her Overgrown Ambush and Countdowned til I Downpoured a Shipment of Wetwork all over her; it smelt like a Bog, but hey. The bed started to Creek and Crash on top of me. So I did her up the Backlot and Striked her good. I Broadcasted it on YouTube.

The Maori running away from the guy he stole the voucher from</p>
<p>[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 18, 2009, 09:05:36 am[/size][hr]There was an Englishman an Irishman and a Maori who all wanted to join the army but they had to pass a test first…</p>
<p>The Englishman went in and the guy asked, “What would happen if one of your eyes got stabbed out?”  He said, “I’ll be half blind!”  Then he asks, “What would happen if both your eyes got stabbed out?”  The Englishman said, “I’ll be full blind!”  The guy said, “Sweet u pass, next!”</p>
<p>So the Irishman came in and the guy asked the same questions and the Irishman gave the same answers so he passed too…</p>
<p>The Maori man was listening at the door for the answers so the guy thought he’d change the questions…</p>
<p>He goes to the Maori man… “What would you do if one of your ears got cut off?”  The Maori man said, “I’ll be half blind!”  Then he asks, “What would you do if both your ears got cut off?”  And the Maori man goes, “I’ll be full blind!”  The guy goes, “Whys that?”  The Maori man goes, “Cause I’ll have no ears to hang my glasses on!”</p>
<p>[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 18, 2009, 09:07:42 am[/size][hr]A maori has a hen which, every morning, rain or shine, lays him an egg in his front garden. This is all very well and good until one day, the hen lays the egg in the next door neighbour’s garden.</p>
<p>Before the maori can go and get it, a samoan runs out the door and grabs the egg.<br>
The maori yells to the samoan, ‘Bro, that’s my egg.’</p>
<p>‘How do you figure?’ asked the samoan.</p>
<p>‘It’s my hen.’<br>
‘It’s my garden!’</p>
<p>‘Tell you what, bro’ said the maori, ‘we’ll settle this Aoteoroa (New Zealand) style. I kick you in the balls as hard as I can, and you kick me in the balls as hard as you can and whoever gets up the quickest wins the egg.’</p>
<p>The samoan thinks about this for a minute, looked at his feet, and remembered he was wearing a nice heavy pair of steel-capped boots. The maori was bare-foot, ‘Ok!’</p>
<p>The maori takes a run-up and kicks the samoan in the nuts as hard as he can.</p>
<p>The samoan lies groaning on the ground for about 15 minutes, and then gets up.</p>
<p>‘Now it’s my turn,’ says the samoan, with a smile.</p>
<p>‘Nah, bro, you can keep the egg.’<br>
[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 18, 2009, 09:13:48 am[/size][hr]One day there was a Maori man,african,aussie and chinesse man and they were all on a plane that was going to crash because of all the Weight on the Plane. So the Piolet says Lose some of the Laggage!</p>
<p>So the African man says Im doing this for my Country and Jumps out the Plane.<br>
And the Chinesse man says Im doing this for my Country and Jumps out.<br>
And then the Maori man says Im doing this for my Country and Pushes the Aussie out.</p>
<p>No offence to anyone while im telling these jokes sorry[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 18, 2009, 09:19:36 am[/size][hr]There was an Aussie guy who was in a pub with a group of friends. He went to buy a beer when the barman said “Did you know that you could get a free beer?” and the Aussie guy says “Really? How?” Then the barman told him “Tell me how many “D’s” there are in 'Here Comes the Bride”’. So the Aussie guy says “One”. Then he got his free beer. He went back to his table and told his friends that he got a free beer. Then his Maori friend got up and went to the barman and asked what he had to do to get a free beer. The barman told him “Tell me how many “D’s” there are in 'Here Comes the Bride”’. Then the Maori guy said to him " Hang on a minute" and went to the toilet. A few moments later, the Maori came out (with a grin on his face) and said “I know how many “D’s” there are” and the barman, who was quite ammused, asked “How many?” and the Maori goes “thirty-six” and the barman asked “How did you get 36?”. The Maori guy replied “Easy… da da-da da, da da-da da…” (as in ‘singing’ the tune for the bridal walk)</p>

              <p>Here’s 1:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">God and Bill Gates</span></p>
<p>“Well, Bill”, said God, “I’m really confused on this one. I’m not sure whether to send you to Heaven or Hell! After all, you helped society enormously by putting a computer in almost every home in the world and yet you created that ghastly Windows. I’m going to do something I’ve never done before. I’m going to let you decide where you want to go!”</p>
<p>Mr. Gates replied, “Well, thanks, Lord. What’s the difference between the two?”</p>
<p>God said, “You can take a peek at both places briefly if it will help you decide. Shall we look at Hell first?” “Sure!” said Bill. “Let’s go!”</p>
<p>Bill was amazed! He saw a clean, white sandy beach with clear waters. There were thousands of beautiful women running around, playing in the water, laughing and frolicking about.</p>
<p>The sun was shining and the temperature was just perfect!</p>
<p>Bill said, “This is great! If this is Hell, I can’t wait to see Heaven!”</p>
<p>To which God replied, “Let’s go!” and off they went. Bill saw puffy white clouds in a beautiful blue sky with angels drifting about playing harps and singing.</p>
<p>It was nice, but surely not as enticing as Hell. Mr. Gates thought for only a brief moment and rendered his decision</p>
<p>“God, I do believe I would like to go to Hell.”</p>
<p>“As you desire,” said God.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, God decided to check up on the late billionaire to see how things were going. He found Bill shackled to a wall, screaming among the hot flames in a dark cave. He was being burned and tortured by demons.</p>
<p>“How ya doin’, Bill?” asked God. Bill responded with anguish and despair.</p>
<p>“This is awful! This is not what I expected at all! What happened to the beach and the beautiful women playing in the water?”</p>
<p>“Oh, THAT!” said God. “That was the screen saver”</p>
