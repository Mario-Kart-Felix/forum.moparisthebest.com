We are gonna ask you to show some of your work on the hand of projects you already made or helped with.
If we decide to hire you as 1 of the 2 open spots you will be granted permission to access a vps and get site priveleges on the hand of a rank.
You will get payed on the hand of donations later in your career.
We want to highlight that we only want people that work hard and without making a mess.

<p>17 years old? lol really?</p>

</aside>
<p>I used to require 18+ unless you showed you had good qualifications and you were mature. It’s totally understandable. Younger people tend to be more immature, and in conflict an immature person (no matter the age) will most likely do something reckless. That, and kids can be annoying.</p>
<p>I know how to write a class, does that make me qualified?</p>
<p>[code=java]<br>
package com.main;</p>
<p>public class AClassForLolz {</p>
<pre><code> public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Do main stuff here yo
 }
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>OP: You give literally no info about your project. You just say you need people for it. What’s the base? the client? The ideals behind it? the point of the project?</p>
