&lt;blockquote&gt;Tomlinson, 47, walking past police with his hands in his pockets, then being knocked to the ground by an officer in riot gear who strikes him from behind with a baton as officers from the City of London force look on. Minutes later Tomlinson suffered a fatal heart attack.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unrelated I know, but on the topic of police brutality, I was assaulted by 3 officers last night when I was protecting my rights. My chest was pushed into the ground so hard that it interfered with my heartbeat. They were punching me and I wasn’t doing anything to resist. It’s a good thing I was tired when I came home, I was getting ready to burn down all 3 of their houses but I slept on it…</p>
<p>But it doesn’t end here. I’m making sure they get fired and if they don’t, their houses may still be coming down yet.<br>
[/quote]Elaborate on “protecting my rights”, please? :p[/quote]</p>
<p>In my friends car, we get pulled over. Cop says it smells like weed, and see’s our rolling papers. We just smoked a joint, and rolled another. So my friend (the driver) has the joint, shows it to the cop because he’s an idiot and doesn’t know that the smell of weed isn’t probable cause to search (remember you need to be in posession of weed to get busted, the smell implies that there WAS weed but not nessasraily anymore. The supreme court ruled this…) And anyways he only had that joint on him which isn’t going to get him in trouble they are just going to take it from him.</p>
<p>Alright so he asks all 3 of us to get out. I was sitting in the back. I was unsure if I had to get out of the vehicle or not, so I did so anyways. Then he demanded that all 3 of us get searched. I was a smart ass about it, but mind you I had a few grams of weed on me. I said can I see your search warrent? He says he doesn’t have one. “Oh, you don’t have one…*laugh, guess you won’t be searching me tonight.”</p>
<p>He said he has probable cause and doesn’t need a warrent, to which I told him he didn’t have probable. Which is true, he does not. Just because I’m riding in the back of some car, and someone had a joint on them, does not give them probable cause to search everyone else in the car. This is the law.</p>
<p>He grabs my belt, pushes me to the car and tries to force me into getting searched. I elbow him very fucking hard in the face, to defend myself from his assault. And he just drops me to the ground. Right away another SUV with 2 cops comes, and I had 3 of them kicking me on the ground, punching me, etc. 3 big cops, on 1 skinny kid. My teeth were bleeding and suprisingly I woke up with no bruises but damn I sure feel like I got hit by a truck.</p>
<p>Anyways they took my weed. There’s no way they could charge me though, and those bastards knew that. After all that fighting, we get left off with a warning. They just wanted some weed for the night.</p>
<p>I’m not letting this go though. I’m going to make sure they get fired, charged, and then maybe I’ll fuck them over some more just for fun. Because I’m a bigger asshole then they are.</p>
<p>But you know what pissed me off? He knows my grandpa. He says he’s going to tell on me…! I said why? It’s not going to change anything between me and him and he probably won’t even mention it. All you’re doing is putting him down. Why would you want to upset him? besides my grandpa has nothing to do with this. And what are you going to say to him? That you ganged up on me with 2 other cops, violated my rights, kicked my ass, and stole my weed? Fucking grow up</p>

But a baton strike with a heart attack as a result is too far fetched to be blamed on the officer. So it’s abuse. He’ll be fired I guess.</p>

<p>He approached the police slowly, with hands in pockets, as if he was going to speak to them about something. They said something, he turned around and walked away, still casually with hands in pockets, then one of them lunged forward, hit him with a baton and pushed him over. Now its possible that after they didn’t let him through the guy said something (I would have, something like “fucking pigs”) - no excuse though, police are trained to deal with abuse.</p>

The same happens in Iraq and Afghanistan. You can’t see the difference between a terrorist and a normal civilian. So if a car approaches a road block, and doesn’t stop, the car will be shot to pieces.<br>

<p>Ok, that’s a difference. But the point is, both the soldiers at a roadblock and these officers can’t see the difference between two groups, as they look the same.</p>

              <p>I don’t think the police officer should be trialled for murder. I mean, it was a situation that required strict law enforcement, and how the hell should the officers know if he was a protester or not? The fact that he wanted to leave the area doesn’t say shit, maybe he just wanted to leave so he wouldn’t get arrested.</p>
<p>The same happens in Iraq and Afghanistan. You can’t see the difference between a terrorist and a normal civilian. So if a car approaches a road block, and doesn’t stop, the car will be shot to pieces.</p>
<p>The officer in question will probably be prosecuted for manslaughter. Definitely not murder, as the officer couldn’t know that the victim had heart problems. But because of the circumstances the punishment wont be that harsh.</p>

              <p>I have no idea if this was the case, but it seems from the videos I’ve seen that he was trying to ask the police if he could get through their line (he wasn’t a protester, he was walking home from work) - is it possible he already felt ill and was trying to get out of the chaos? <em>shrug</em></p>
<p>Either way, pig deserves a beating. He won’t get it though. Probably won’t even lose his job.</p>
