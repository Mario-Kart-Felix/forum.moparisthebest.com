    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-pi-while-compiling/409885</link>
    <description>Hi i think this is my first topic, if this is in the wrong section please let me know. I have found some topics about this but it seemed the problem wasnt solved. I have a pi source its basically blank. the source says it has no anti leech. Heres the problem i compile my server and things dont change. The main thing is the servers name soul split and i want it to be my custom name. every thing that says soulsplit has been changed to my custom name, i complie and nothing changes. please i could really use some help. also i am trying to add custom weapons they are chaotic wepons i added the ints and models to raw and ints to itemdef and then added idcodes and thats were the problem is. i add the id codes that are in the itemdef and also added to item.java under weapons. whats wrong?. thanks if you have a answer that isnt insulting that would be great!

note:economyreset.java uses overides a depricated API
note:recomplile with -Xlint:description for details
