              <p>Well, unless somebody programs in all the features of real runescape into a private server, you’re going to have to keep paying for Runescape members. Though some basic things such as items, NPCs, movement, etc… are available in private servers, everything else is being programmed in one step at a time, and so far there has been little cohesion between the groups of people adding features, so it will be a while yet before we have a RS2 server with all the features of Membership.</p>
