    <description>and fangirls

theres stupid little nerds out there who love zezima so much they acually worship him.i mean like its ok to like him but to worship him....thats just plain sad...

and also theres people who are so jelous that he has 99 everything they say crappy stuff about him.and theres zezima impersonators out there claiming to be the real zezima....no life whatsoever no matter what way you look at it...

i have some things to say to all the people who talk crap about zezima.

zezima is the best player in runescape get over it you stupid retards.

he deserves some props for being the best player in runescape,a lot of you are just jelous that hes the best well get over it.

just leave zezima alone already...he likes playing the game,stop acting like noobs and talkin bullshit about him.

dont say false stuff about him unless u have acual proof.when i say proof i mean real raw PROOF.

not no stupid rumors or guesses.

not from hearin it from your friends or anyone else online.

not sayin you heard it from zezima in game unless he himself p.ms me ingame.

not from any nerdy zezima fanboy websites.

not from anywhere even with the interview with zezima cause a lot of times that stuff can be fake.

unless he says it himself,and i dont mean people posting here claiming to be zezima or makin a account called zezima and makin a video on youtube to try to proove me wrong.

nothin like that at all.

only if zezima himself says it in game.runescape.

i dont mean runescape private server or anythin else.i mean the real runescape itself.

no wannabe zezima noobs nothin.

a lot of you guys say zezima is a person who has no life and only plays runescape.

well i say the people who claim to be zezima or say false stuff about zezima and talk crap bout him and etc. then you are the ones who have no life...

your just more worse then him then...hes playing runescape and what are your doing?....talkin bs bout him and etc.

if you like zezima thats fine.but if you say bullshit bout him then your just a plain loser.

if he likes playing runescape thats fine.let him do that.but dont bother him and follow him around runescape askin for free stuff or tryin to be his friend or trying to trade with him to see if he will buy your stuff.

he plays games a lot.i dont really see anything wrong with that.games are pretty cool.theres a lot of people who play games a lot too.just because u dont think runescape isnt the greatest game to play then dont play it.he likes the game.that might be his best game.i dont know.i bet everyone has a favorite game they like to play a lot.if this is his favorite one fine.thats cool.

everyone doesnt have the same outlook on certain game.everyone doesnt have the same taste in game.well that makes us individual beings on this earth.were gonna die eventually.spend it anyway you want.but i dont think workin the rest of your life is the best cause your just another prisoner.playin games shows that your doing what you want to do.and not doing something that you dont like for someone else.but whatever.do whatever you want with your life.

and dont say that i have no life for writing this....cause i know that someone was gonna say well u dont have no life too if your talkin about zezima.or call me a nerdy fanboy.

well im saying good stuff about zezima.im not trying to say false stuff about him cause i have no idea who he or she is at all.

and im try to just tell people to leave zezima alone already.seriously theres way too many people who make fun of him or her for being the best.thats all

i bet im gonna get a lot of negative replies or somethin...

and im also refering to the person who posted stuff bout zezima

and i fixed the fuckin replies so you dont get a pussy attack acting like you have a plunger stuck all the way up your ass from a plumer rape assault</description>
