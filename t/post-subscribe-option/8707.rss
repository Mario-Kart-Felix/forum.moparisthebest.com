    <description>I think there should be a way that you can keep the threads that you like in a specific folder. This would be like Vbulletin where you can subscribe for them. It would be good because then you won&#39;t have to go find the threads, and you won&#39;t forget about them. It would be a quick reference. Is there anyway to do this?

Thanks
Leader
