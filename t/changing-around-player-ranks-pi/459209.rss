    <description>I want my server to have:
[code]playerRights = 0; = Banned.
playerRights = 1; = Player.
playerRights = 2; = Donor.
playerRights = 3; = Super Donor.
playerRights = 4; = Extreme Donor.
playerRights = 5; = Veteran.
playerRights = 6; = Mod.
playerRights = 7; = Admin.
playerRights = 8; = Owner.[/code]
Then, I would like help with all of the commands to be set correctly.
Then commands to make players each of these.


Currently I have:
[code]pR = 0; = player
pR = 1; = mod
pR = 2; = admin
pR = 3; = owner
pR = 4; = donor
pR = 5; = ?
pR = 6; = ?
pR = 7; = ?[/code]</description>

RS2LoginProtocolDecoder - Anyone with player rights of 0, send a return code of 20 or whatever the banned return code is. Set the default value of your player rights to 1 in your player saving class (you could skip this step if you switched around the ‘banned’ with the ‘player’ player rights).
