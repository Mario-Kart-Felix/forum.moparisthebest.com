    <title>Currently trying to Make a sever with someone, I will host!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/currently-trying-to-make-a-sever-with-someone-i-will-host/545470</link>
    <description>I can host the server 24/7, typically want to do a 317 but if someone wants to do a 718 or something and knows how to code one than Id be all in. But I will host and I have teamviewer so you can code thru that on my computer aswell  as I can watch and learn that way too. Eventually when donations come in we can do vps but I don&#39;t want any of the donations so you could use your paypal. My Skype is Skittles.harr0x</description>
