              <p>Look on the thread, there should be the Hamachi Details. Copy them, (Name &amp; Password).<br>
Then go onto Hamachi and click on the Triangle &gt; Join an existing Network &gt; Add Details.</p>
<p>Thats Hamachi Done.</p>
<p>Then Open Moparscape and add the Server IP &amp; Server Port.<br>
Should be pretty straight foward from there? Make an Acc. and Log in <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
