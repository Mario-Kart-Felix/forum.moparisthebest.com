    <description>Hi,

Now some of you may know me, i was very occupied with MoparScape a while back, around a year, and my memory has killed itself and i have all my files but i just need alittle info on creating and running a server, without HAM. Yeah i know, i feel pretty dumb but i want to get my old server back up, PkxScape.

Yeah dont tell me im a stupid, because i know i am right now :X

 Enjoy MoparScape,

              <p>i got a website with a guide on this one sec[br][size=1]Posted on: June 16, 2007, 05:03:18 PM[/size][hr]all right heres my guide</p>
<p>I decided to make this little guide based off what I had to do to get server up and running. Hope u all enjoy.</p>
<p>K first off go download winrar. I recomend going on <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a> and and searching for free winrar lol. NOTE (winrar is what makes it so u can actually download sources exc.)</p>
<p>K second off u need to get a server source. Download and save it to your documents. I recomend Testscape for new coders and PVP scape or Pimpscape for advanced. NOTE; i will not be releasing my source ;p.</p>
<p>Now once uve done all of that u should see a pile off books in your documents that says eather Testscape or w/e source u downloaded. Right click those and then click extract and then ok. No u should have a folder with the same name as the books. Open it and find Client.java. Right click Client.java and click open with and use notepad. Now u may start editing stuff. I recomend asking in tut forum for help with added stuff.</p>
<p>Now Go to <a href="http://no-ip.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> and register. Once ur done log on and look at the left of the screen for somthing that says host/redirects and clickHos add. Click it and where it says Hostname and change to what u want ur no-ip to be. then under that u can click the drop down thing and pic if u want no-ip.info, <a href="http://no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.org</a>, no-ip.biz, ect. Now dont touch anything else just scroll down to where it says create host and click that. No u have a proper host <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>K for the part where u make it so every one else can get on. Click downloads at top of screen on <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> and choose what type of software u have(weather it be mac, windows, lunix, ect.) and download it to ur desktop. Open it and do all the stuff it says. Then when u get the pop up with ur server ip in it check the box beside ur servers ip. NOTE (There will only be one thing in there). Once uve click and u should hav server ready to go online.</p>
<p>Now go into ur documents and open ur server again. Now open Runeserver.bat. And there u go just log on now.</p>
