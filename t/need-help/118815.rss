    <description>Before I say anything is there a tutorial anywhere which tells you about all the operators, functions and whatnot, like what does &#39;void&#39; mean..

#2 where in client.java do I find the speed that a wep attacks at (I want to change speed of c bow)

#3 How would i go about making all the spells need the runes the req.

#4 (major one) Alot of the mods have to easy exp, where do I define how much exp you earn per hit
    like 4 is normal in runescape

#5 How would I make a schedule, Like after taking a pot, take of 1 pt every minute.

#6 What lvl hit&#39;s what, say at 10 str you can hit a 4 where Would I find this.
