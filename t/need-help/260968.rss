    <description>I need help. When I start my server and go to the client (Web browser or downloaded). I get the interface but just a black screenfor the rest. This happens if I use testscape or Phonescape. I have winrar and Java. It worked a couple days ago, I don&#39;t know what happens. When I log in the command prompt says the following. (I&#39;m using Mod taharok&#39;s compiler.(
