    <description>Okay, I don&#39;t have much experience with P-Servers but after rage quitting from RS, I wanna make my own.

I&#39;ve played on a few pservers for about a month so I know they work.

I honestly have NO idea how to code, or even get my own client up so if anyone could help me I&#39;d be VERY appreciated.

If you wanna guide me through the whole then just PM me 

Or if you have any links or stuff that would help post here

thank you,

bye</description>

              <p>I made a few, you know like for fun, and they all went downhill from there if your a beginner then goodluck. TBH I thought it was hard with the portfowarding and all then it gets easyer from there. But If you dont have a VPS(Visual Private Share) Then your server will most likely not get popular. But I recommend using the Search Bar, and GOODLUCK BRUH</p>
