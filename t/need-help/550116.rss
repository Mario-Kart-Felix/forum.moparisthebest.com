    <description>Does anyone know how to make it so that when a new player joins, it makes a certain npc talk to him? I know how to make him spawn in a certain place, but i want a tutorial npc to talk to him as well, and I don&#39;t know how to make that happen without the player clicking talk. Please help

Update: still need help with this issue</description>
