    <description>This is probably alot to ask,
But does anyone know which files, where the code is that the players are built from,
I understand that the sprites are seperated, by heads, torsos, bodys ect, then they must be put together in game?
what im wondering is, if u wear a plate, does it go over the torso or replace it? because a med helm/ party hat would keep the head, but a full helm wouldnt ect..
does each item have a certain offset? if someone could explain or tell me where I can find this info, I needa know how its all put together.
also , how big are the maps, and how are they made? are they done, isometric, perspective ect? what happens with the camera, does it redraw what you see when you rotate, or does it just pan around what you see ect? is it done 3d coords to screen coords? is it made of polygons ect, and is the map pitched, or is the camera angled ?</description>
