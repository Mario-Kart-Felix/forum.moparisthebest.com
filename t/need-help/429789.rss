i cant run my runserver.bat file  which means i cant put my server online any way to fix this problem. i would really appreciate it?

i tryed changing the file to a dll file but it didnt do anything.

and this is in extracted format if your wondering. i cant just click on it an run the file. everytime i click on the file it opens it up as a notepad.</description>

Click “save as” then rename the file “runeserver.Bat” then you should be fine.</p>
