             int number = 100:
             int first = 1;
             int sec = 2;
             int third = 3;

 do{system.out.println(&quot;this is the :&quot; +first &quot;loop that you have went through&quot;}
 while(number = 100);     
       number = number + 100;
 
 do{system.out.println(&quot;this is the :&quot; +sec &quot;loop that you have went through&quot;}
while(number = 200);     
       number = number + 100;

do{system.out.println(&quot;this is the :&quot; +third &quot;loop that you have went through&quot;}
while(number = 300);     
       number = number + 100;

do{system.out.println(&quot;this is the :&quot; +fourth &quot;loop that you have went through&quot;}
while(number = 400);     
       number = number + 100;

do{system.out.println(&quot;this is the :&quot; +fith &quot;loop that you have went through&quot;}
while(number = 500);
