    <description>Hey,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Step 6.5- Only for people who have routers
Portforwarding

If you did step 6 and when you tried to login using the ip you made and it said &quot;error connecting to server,&quot; that means you will need to portforward and run no-ip.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I cant do his TUT on this because i dont have linksys router.  I have an Actiontec router.  The Interface is all different.  Can someone tell me how.
