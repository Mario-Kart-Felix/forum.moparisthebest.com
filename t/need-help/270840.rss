    <description>Guys, this is probally a really easy question to solve, but i dont get whats happening.  I had a private server up, like i was hosting it.  So, i decided to leave it up all night, when i woke up..the command prompt window had some weird code in it, and the server was down.  So, i decided to try and start it up again, it says that its online, but i cant connect to the host. (which is me :( )

Yes, i checked my host, and updated them, and i even made a new account, made a new host and tried that. Also, i downloaded no-ip again, and then tried. 

No-ip says that my server is online, but its just not working for some reason, if someone has a answer for this problem i would be very grateful :D

Thanks
