    <description>Well I use to get really slow download speeds when I torrented and use to think it was becuase my ports were blocked(on a router) But I set the dmz host to my computer and now my ports are open..and my speed increased but yet nowhere near my brothers,who could torrent the same torrent and kill me in speed.

Network connections:

LAN - 100mbps connected,sending packets and receiving.

1394 Connection-400mpbs says connected,but not receiving packets or sending.

Both of them have a small lock symbol next to them.

So my question is how do i get my 1394 connection working so i can pickup in speeds,will it affect the other computer?Take more bandwith on router or such?Or am I stuck.

Using a D-link router.

Please and thanks.</description>
