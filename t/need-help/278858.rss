    <description>im a good coder but i cannot host because of i have a really bad pc and i cant portforward my router because i do not know the password and i dont want to reset my router.

so i have a hoster but the problem is i want to acsses the files 24/7 but he  cant trust me with teamviewer so is there any way which i can share the files with him. and it has to update for example

so i just coded my server and i sent uploaded it and my hoster downloaded it
next day im playing when my hoster is not online and someone reports a bug to me how can i fix it?
so how can i acsses just the files of my hosters comp? so basiccaly i want to share the file but it has to keep updaiting.</description>
