    <description>You may have seen my last post saying i did not have a client.java file so I could not add any shops yet there were already shops in my server that were fully working. So I decided to download a new source with the file client.java inside it but now I have other problems.

I follow all the tutorials on youtube, using shops,autospawn and client.java files to add a shop yet I can spawn the NPCC but I cannot trade him ..

Any help ??

A video I posted onto youtube showing that I am doing the correct things yet I still cannot trade the NPCC

What i put in each file.

Client - } else if (NPCID == 659) { //Party Pete PutNPCCoords = true; WanneShop = 1; //Special Hat Shop

Shops - shop = 1 Special_Hats 2 2 1038 10 1040 10 1042 10 1044 10 1046 10 1048 10 1050 25

Autospawn - spawn = 659 3091 3487 0 0 0 0 0 0 party pete</description>
