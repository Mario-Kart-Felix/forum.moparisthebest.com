    <description>Hi, I recently made a server and it works fine, but it always take from 5 to 20 clicks to log in!
Can someone help me with this problem?
I am using a source named &quot;Slipknot Scape&quot;.
It also takes all my players NUMEROUS clicks to log in.

BTW, it is most likely not my computer&#39;s speed, because my computer is 2.5 gigabytes.

THANKS!</description>
