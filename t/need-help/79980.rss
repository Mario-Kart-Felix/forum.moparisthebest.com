    <description>io have used many different programs and none of them work, i need a link to a useful draynor autochopper and banker that WORKS. For the past 4 days I have been trying scripts and not one of them has actually cut down any trees for me. I dont unererstand it. I am doing everything right because the script runs but none of them work. They start bring me over by the trees then they sit there until i get logged out for not doing anything, I am starting to get mad about all of this crap. At the moment i dont have $ to pay for the script.
