    <description>Well, I have been hosting a silabsoft server recently and its going pretty well, but I can&#39;t make my server 24/7 since my restarter won&#39;t work


What my problem is is that the only way my server can be online is if I launch server from my compiler, and my runserver.bat and copy of runserver.bat states server is online, but nobody can join! My goal is for the restarter to launch with the compiler but I have no Idea how to get that to work, if anyone has had this problem or just knows how to help, please reply!   ;)</description>
