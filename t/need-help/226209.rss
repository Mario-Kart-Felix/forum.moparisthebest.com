    <description>This shouldn&#39;t take long, if someone would finally FREAKIN HELP ME!!!

anyway... so I put in a case for  a chest


[code]
  case 2191:   //2191 is the object ID for the chest I&#39;m using
		if (playerHasItem(1603) == true &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(1607) == true) {
			addItem(995, 500000);
			deleteItem(1603, getItemSlot(1603), 1);
			deleteItem(1607, getItemSlot(1607), 1);
		} else {
			sendMessage(&quot;You need BOTH OF THE RINGS to get your reward&quot;);
		}
		break;  
[/code]

Okay, now what I was trying to do was make it to where if you had the sapphire ring (1603) AND the ruby ring (1607) it would give you a reward of 500k (995, 500000), now when I compile it, it shows up as complete, no errors, but when I click on the chest with my two rings... NOTHING HAPPENS!!!

So obviously I did something wrong... could someone please point out what I did wrong?
Thanks, 00ryn00</description>
