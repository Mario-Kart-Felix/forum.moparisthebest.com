    <description>Me and my Partner are making a server with a TeamTorva Base, We have done everything we needed and still cant seem to access it from different computers, Basically we can&#39;t make the server &quot;LIVE&quot;  Any help would be appreciated

Edit: I think it may be a portforwarding problem, Westell is the router, very difficult.

my skype is ljaywilson

Add me there please.</description>
