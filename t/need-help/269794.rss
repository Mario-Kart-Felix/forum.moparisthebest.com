    <description>I made my first model from scratch on Metasequoia, but when I went to color in the faces, it doesn&#39;t color right. I want the hilt to be a dark gray/black color and when I color it, it looks correct, but when I rotate the model, it turns to a light gray/white color. Any ideas on how I can fix this? I also don&#39;t want to make it a constant, because then it will look flat and even though it is pretty much a box, I am still trying to keep it look atleast a little bit 3D. Does anyone have any ideas on what I did wrong?

Does it have to be inside of the green, red, and blue lines?</description>

              <p>either you got the specular turned up and power turned down on the material.<br>

you got overlapping faces.</p>
<p>Play with your specular and power on the material or join closed vertices then delete overlapping faces.</p>
<p>If that don’t sort it, select the black face and 'hide selected faces (under attributes), the select the del tool (under the create tool) and delete the offending face. Then show hidden faces.</p>
