    <description>I have reccently brought a counder strike source server, i was wondering, is there any chance i could link my RSPS run.bat to it? Say for example if the ip was

89.678.89.56/pserver/&quot;all files here&quot;

How would i place that in my servers run.bat
Is it possible?

Rich&#39; don&#39;t lock this as it is to do with RSPS, i want to know how to run my server from a listen server basically...</description>
