    <description>I dont know if this is the right part but i didint see anything better to post it on.

my problem is  :mad: that i cant get on any server because it loads part way up than the whole screan just drops down and kills it&#39;s self.
i was wondering if anyone had a solution to this because im realy sick of not being able to play and one of my freinds said it might be because i have an old computer but i just got this computer last year so thats not the case.(and the latest version of java)</description>
