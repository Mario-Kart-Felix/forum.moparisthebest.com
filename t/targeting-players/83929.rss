              <p>Making it look for specific text like  if(level &gt;80 and &lt;126)then.  Im not exactly sure how to do it, but im pretty sure it can be done because ive seen a script that looks for levels at the topleft of the screen.  You will need to look into it though.</p>

<p>Your best bet would be to check map direction and mmouse where they most likely are and check uptext, or find any specific colour in the area they might be.</p>

<p>Your question can be answered by simple logic, how do you go about finding a player you’d like to attack in RS anyway? Simple, right click a pile of them, find the level you want, if it’s not there click another pile and ect ect.</p>
<p>You could do this a number of ways, move mouse to key points of the screens where the player(s) might be, get their level(Look in SRL manual), and attack if possible. What I mean is, if your going to varrack level one wildy and your at the gates, go over the ditch, and look to the right + left of the screen.</p>
