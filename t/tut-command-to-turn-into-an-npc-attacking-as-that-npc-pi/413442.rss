    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-command-to-turn-into-an-npc-attacking-as-that-npc-pi/413442</link>
    <description>not sure if you would consider this a snippet or tutorial, but ill post it here because i consider this to be a tutorial.

anyway im going to explain how to use a command to turn into an npc, and then use their attacks for really attacking instead of your regular weapon attacks..lets start

base: PI Renamed could be changed easily
difficulty 2\10 need to find other animations for npcs
heres what your adding.
[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MlWTYXeqqY[/youtube]

[size=24pt]EVERYTHING IS EXPLAINED IN THE CODE TAGS[/size]

first: go into commands.java and use this as your base for doing this..yes i will also give an example one.

[code]
if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;##&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {//change ## to the name of the command
		int id = ###;//change ### to the id of the NPC u desire
		c.npcId2 = id;//this just reads the id of the npc
		c.isNpc = true;//verifies your a npc
		c.updateRequired = true;//updates character
		c.appearanceUpdateRequired = true;//updates appearance
		c.playerStandIndex = ###;//change ### to the npc&#39;s stand animation
		c.playerTurnIndex = ###;//change ### to its turn animation(usually walk)
		c.playerWalkIndex = ###;//change ### to the walk animation
		c.playerTurn180Index = ###;//change ### to the npc&#39;s half turn animation(usually walk)
		c.playerTurn90CWIndex = ###;//change ### to the npc&#39;s 1\4 turn animation(usually walk)
 		c.playerTurn90CCWIndex = ###;//change ### to the npc&#39;s half turn animation(usually walk)
		c.playerRunIndex = ###;//change to the npc&#39;s run animation or use walk
	}
[/code]

example one, im using black demon.

[code]
if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;demon&quot;)) {
			int id = 82;
			c.npcId2 = id;
			c.isNpc = true;
			c.updateRequired = true;
			c.appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
			c.playerStandIndex = 66;
			c.playerTurnIndex = 66;
			c.playerWalkIndex = 63;
			c.playerTurn180Index = 66;
			c.playerTurn90CWIndex = 66;
			c.playerTurn90CCWIndex = 63;
			c.playerRunIndex = 63;
		}
[/code]

now for setting up the attack and block emotes.

go into combatassistant.java

first for attacks: search 
[code]
public int getWepAnim(String weaponName) {
[/code]

under that add

[code]
if ((c.npcId2 == ###)) {//change ### to the id of the npc being used
                        return ####;//change #### to the attack animation of the npc
}
[/code]

for black demon:

[code]
if ((c.npcId2 == 84)) {
                        return 64;
}
[/code]

now for block:

search
[code]
	public int getBlockEmote() {
[/code]

under that add:
[code]
if ((c.npcId2 == ###)) {//change ### to the id of the npc being used
                        return ####;//change #### to the block animation of the npc
}
[/code]

for black demon:
[code]
if ((c.npcId2 == 84)) {
                        return 65;
}
[/code]

now save both of the files you edited and compile. go into your server and type out your command and test it out, have fun and enjoy your npcs :D also there may be other ways of doing this but this is how i did it and it worked great. if you come here to flame, just leave, anyway, hate it, rate, comment, and post any errors you get, ill help fix them. :D if i dont get comments for this, ill just remove :o leecherz will leechz</description>

              <p>“Turning into a NPC” is a bit misleading. All you give is the command, and you don’t even tell them how it actually changes the update block or give any information on that.</p>

              <p>not sure if you would consider this a snippet or tutorial, but ill post it here because i consider this to be a tutorial.</p>
<p>anyway im going to explain how to use a command to turn into an npc, and then use their attacks for really attacking instead of your regular weapon attacks…lets start</p>
<p>base: PI Renamed could be changed easily<br>
difficulty 2\10 need to find other animations for npcs<br>
heres what your adding.<br>
[youtube]<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MlWTYXeqqY%5B/youtube%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MlWTYXeqqY[/youtube]</a></p>
<p>[size=24pt]EVERYTHING IS EXPLAINED IN THE CODE TAGS[/size]</p>
<p>first: go into commands.java and use this as your base for doing this…yes i will also give an example one.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (playerCommand.startsWith("##") &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {//change ## to the name of the command
		int id = ###;//change ### to the id of the NPC u desire
		c.npcId2 = id;//this just reads the id of the npc
		c.isNpc = true;//verifies your a npc
		c.updateRequired = true;//updates character
		c.appearanceUpdateRequired = true;//updates appearance
		c.playerStandIndex = ###;//change ### to the npc's stand animation
		c.playerTurnIndex = ###;//change ### to its turn animation(usually walk)
		c.playerWalkIndex = ###;//change ### to the walk animation
		c.playerTurn180Index = ###;//change ### to the npc's half turn animation(usually walk)
		c.playerTurn90CWIndex = ###;//change ### to the npc's 1\4 turn animation(usually walk)
 		c.playerTurn90CCWIndex = ###;//change ### to the npc's half turn animation(usually walk)
		c.playerRunIndex = ###;//change to the npc's run animation or use walk
	}</code></pre>
<p>example one, im using black demon.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (playerCommand.startsWith("demon")) {
			int id = 82;
			c.npcId2 = id;
			c.isNpc = true;
			c.updateRequired = true;
			c.appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
			c.playerStandIndex = 66;
			c.playerTurnIndex = 66;
			c.playerWalkIndex = 63;
			c.playerTurn180Index = 66;
			c.playerTurn90CWIndex = 66;
			c.playerTurn90CCWIndex = 63;
			c.playerRunIndex = 63;
		}</code></pre>
<p>now for setting up the attack and block emotes.</p>
<p>go into combatassistant.java</p>
<p>first for attacks: search</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int getWepAnim(String weaponName) {</code></pre>
<p>under that add</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if ((c.npcId2 == ###)) {//change ### to the id of the npc being used
                        return ####;//change #### to the attack animation of the npc
}</code></pre>
<p>for black demon:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if ((c.npcId2 == 84)) {
                        return 64;
}</code></pre>
<p>now for block:</p>
<p>search</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	public int getBlockEmote() {</code></pre>
<p>under that add:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if ((c.npcId2 == ###)) {//change ### to the id of the npc being used
                        return ####;//change #### to the block animation of the npc
}</code></pre>
<p>for black demon:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if ((c.npcId2 == 84)) {
                        return 65;
}</code></pre>
<p>now save both of the files you edited and compile. go into your server and type out your command and test it out, have fun and enjoy your npcs <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> also there may be other ways of doing this but this is how i did it and it worked great. if you come here to flame, just leave, anyway, hate it, rate, comment, and post any errors you get, ill help fix them. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> if i dont get comments for this, ill just remove :o leecherz will leechz</p>
