    <title>Illegal to Receive donations/payments on your server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/illegal-to-receive-donations-payments-on-your-server/520451</link>
    <description>Apparently it is against the mojang TOS to receive payments/donations for items on your server. So it&#39;s RSPS all over again lol.

I&#39;m just wondering if everyone else knew this already? I just assumed it was okay to do because every big server does it.

One of my friends wanted to run a big server and emailed them to see if he could sell VIP and other things on his server and they said no.</description>

</aside>
<p>I thought every single donation was “general”, because that is what makes it a donation. If someone is specifically donating for an item, that would be called purchasing. People have been slinging the donation term around for way too long, and using it the wrong way.</p>
<p>Edit: I’m not quite sure how CraftBukkit is made, or any other general server source that is compatible with the Minecraft client, but I’m sure there are some exceptions in purchases.</p>
<p>Edit again: Could you please give me a direct link to where exactly you find this information (I know you said it was in the TOS), because every source I have read it is 100% legal to profit off of a Minecraft server, but if the profit is from a payment rather than a donation, you are required to pay taxes every year if you receive a certain amount of income; however, this is based on which country you live in, but if you live in the US, you have to pay taxes to the IRS once you receive a certain income amount.</p>

Donations for items, not donations in general. You’re simple not allowed to treat people different depending on how much they paid.<br>
[/quote]I wish jagex enforced this for RSPS, shutting down any of them that sell items :([/quote]<br>
Ironicly it might be harder to enforce that, as many servers aren’t really violating Jagex’ copyright (iirc) and no TOS was agreed upon between server owners and Jagex.</p>

<p>But all the big servers take “donations” for VIP or items, so really they’re just payments. I was just amazed because most of the big servers do it even though it’s against the TOS. Not sure if it’s technically illegal and a lawsuit could be made against the servers.</p>
