Runesky is a 317 server packed with a bunch of custom content. It&#39;s nothing like all the average servers out there. 
On Runesky you are being introduced to our custom home located in Port Phasmatys with shops and npc&#39;s placed all around the place. 
We have a friendly staff team, and there is always people there to help you if you need any kind of support.

This is not the type of server you have to spend hours on to learn. Everything from teleports, bosses, minigames &amp; shops is easy avilable at home.
You can also type in [i]::commands[/i] for a list of all our commands.

[U][b]Some more info:[/b][/U]

[b]SKILLS:[/b]
Once again Runesky decided they were going to do  a thing different from other severs, 
rather than having levuls going up to 99, we had them going up to 126 with a max xp of 250m and a max combat level of 160, 
but in wilderness it will change to max level going up to 110 and max combat level of 140 (this changes back once you leave the wildness).

[b]PVP:[/b]
The main place on Runesky for player killing is Hill Giants. The main weapons is Dragon Claws%2S Dark bow, Night bow (custom), Seren Godsword (custom), Dragon Cross bow, Vesta long sword and also all regular godswords, along with &quot;E&quot; Godswords for donators.

When you have killed a player you will get 2 pk points which allows you to later spend the pk points on certain rewards from the Pk shop. There are also recorded stats for your kills, you will have the ability to wear the Player killing skill capes. 200 kills for Un-trimmed cape, 400 kills &amp; .6 ratio for (t) cape, and 600 kills &amp; .8 ratio for (m) cape.

[b]PVM:[/b]
Runesky has a wide range of bosses for PvM, some of them are; Sea Troll Queen, Jad, Dagganoth Kings, Mithril Dragon, King Black Dragon, Kalphite Queen. But the best bosses are Bandos, Armadyl, Zammy, Saradomin and Corporeal Beast.
These monsters drop the most valuable items on Runesky.

[b]DONATORS:[/b]
You get a 15% increase on all experience you gain, ability to go to  donatorzone, donator shop, spirit shields, ability to go to the corporeal beast and tormented demons, Vengance, Donator godswords, and much more!
