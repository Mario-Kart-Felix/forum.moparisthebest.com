    <title>639 - Making a highscores page</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/639-making-a-highscores-page/439630</link>
    <description>So on our 639, because we dont have a highscores page everytime some one logs off the server it sends that information to our website (which has Mysql thing) and because it has no website for highscores to go to it has to think and then it finally just goes away, creating an annoying lag.

So i was wondering if any1 could tell me how to make a highscores page, because i really have no idea. And we are dementhium 639 based. 

Thanks.</description>
