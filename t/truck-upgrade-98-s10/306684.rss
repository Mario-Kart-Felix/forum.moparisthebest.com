    <title>Truck Upgrade? 98 S10</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/truck-upgrade-98-s10/306684</link>
    <description>So i have a 1998 Chevy S10 and I&#39;m thinking about doing the following:

Air Intake: Cold Air Intake
Turbo or Super Charge (Idk which one is better for horse power)
Change car from all wheel to 4 wheel drive
Engine: I don&#39;t know yet
Automatic to Manual
Dual Exhaust (special mod for flames out the Exhaust)
Increasing Air Intake
22 inch rims (black)
New body kit
paint job: Black and purple mix
Hydrolics, Bags, lower: (I don&#39;t know if i wanna do any of these because i dont wanna mess up my suspension)
Suicide, Lambo, Butter fly (I want opinions on which one would look the best, im thinking suicide but i want opinions)
Replace back window with one that can open and make a bed that attaches to the cab and add subs and base in trunk
Interior: Black Leather

can anyone give me their opinions on what would be best for horsepower on this truck, thank you.</description>

<p>You can actually do it by putting spark plugs towards the end of your exhaust and wire them to a coil that is turned on and off by a switch or button you can push.  This will ignite the unburned gas and shoot out flames, don’t have a good paint job though because it will just torch it off.</p>

You do realize this will cost you a lot of money that I’m pretty sure you, at 16 years old, don’t have. Go back to playing Need For Speed  :rolleyes:</p>

<p>You didn’t explain why.  Both a supercharger and a turbocharger are forced air induction.  This is opposite to a car that is naturally aspirated.  A turbocharger operates off of exhaust gases, using the force of the exhaust air to spin a turbine forcing air back into the intake manifold.  Waiting for this turbine to ‘spin up’ is the cause of so-called ‘turbo lag’.  A supercharger operates via a belt or a chain (usually a cogged belt) connected to the crankshaft, which is what the pistons turn in your engine, therefore whenever your engine is running it is spinning and operating the supercharger, which again forces air into your engine.  Superchargers give you more low-end torque compared to turbochargers which give you more high-end torque.</p>
<p>If you are curious why I didn’t mention horse power (HP), it is simply because it is mathematically calculated with this simple formula:<br>
Horse Power = RPM * Torque</p>

<p>As for the engine, swap a HEMI in it, or a big block atleast V8 like Travis implies.<br>
To turbo/supercharge… What kind of power are you looking for?<br>
A supercharger would be more suited for a V8 engine with a big displacement.<br>
Because with a supercharger you have instant power from idle RPM.<br>
With the turbo charger it has to spool up in order to deliver any power, which could give you a very narrow power band.[/quote]</p>
<p>Swapping in a Big block would be a complete nightmare, doable, just not at all easy.  A small block V8 like I swapped in though is practically a bolt-in replacement.  (350ci is what mine is, you could get a stock pontiac 400 small block to work too, or if you have a lot of money you can get a 454ci small block crate engine to put in it)</p>

              <p>What kind of engine is it in right now?  A 4.3 V6 or something else?  If it is a 4.3 V6 then it is almost trivial to drop a 350 V8 in there just like I did when my engine blew at 314,000 miles.  That would be my first move I guess, unless you want to install a good stereo system first.</p>

<p>is all wheel not 4wd?</p>

</aside>
<p>yes</p>
<p>AWD = tires can have different amounts of power applied to them</p>
<p>4wd = same amount of power goes into each tire</p>

              <p>You’re retarded. Good luck with this so called ‘project’ of yours. Why don’t you do a little research about your vehicle, and see what comes of that before you post dumb topics like this. I highly doubt for one, that you’ll do any of these things. Much less even attempt to learn about your vehicle.</p>

              <p>So i have a 1998 Chevy S10 and I’m thinking about doing the following:</p>
<p>Air Intake: Cold Air Intake<br>
Turbo or Super Charge (Idk which one is better for horse power)<br>
Change car from all wheel to 4 wheel drive<br>
Engine: I don’t know yet<br>
Automatic to Manual<br>
Dual Exhaust (special mod for flames out the Exhaust)<br>
Increasing Air Intake<br>
22 inch rims (black)<br>
New body kit<br>
paint job: Black and purple mix<br>
Hydrolics, Bags, lower: (I don’t know if i wanna do any of these because i dont wanna mess up my suspension)<br>
Suicide, Lambo, Butter fly (I want opinions on which one would look the best, im thinking suicide but i want opinions)<br>
Replace back window with one that can open and make a bed that attaches to the cab and add subs and base in trunk<br>
Interior: Black Leather</p>
<p>can anyone give me their opinions on what would be best for horsepower on this truck, thank you.</p>
