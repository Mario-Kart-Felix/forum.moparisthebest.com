              <p>Well, usually in PI you’re wanting an object to move you somewhere it’d be like this.</p>
<p><code>
case ####:
movePlayer(####,####,#);
break;</code></p>
<p>That’s usually in Actionhandler.java</p>
<p>If you’re using something different, It’s very relevant  to it.<br>
Search for words like, teleport, move, etc.</p>
