    <description>Hey everyone, So basically i&#39;ve got my source up on my vps, ready to host, port forward works, everything is good. However, When i run my server, I get an error Saying- java.io.FileNotFoundExeption: C;\Users\root\ecogames\test123.bin &lt;the system cannot find the path specified. Can anyone help me with this? I&#39;d really appreciate it and will most likely send you some money on paypal for your help. Thanks for reading,
