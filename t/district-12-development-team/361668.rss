    <description>Hey there everyone, Im the owner of District 12 and I need some help. District 12 is a 317 server still very new, but I have gotten mostly good feedback from the players that have joined.

First, ill give a small bit of history of myself. I have been working with RSPS for roughly 2 years, my old moparscape account is BuckyBKatt. Im not the best programmer with Java, I mainly program with C# and a bit of XNA.

Here&#39;s a list of the client&#39;s features (It&#39;s nothing special)
  - Splash screen on start
  - Jframe with links to voting
  - Custom background
  - Has real item models 

Here&#39;s a list of the server&#39;s features
  - Home in falador
  - Skillcapes (no emotes unfortunetly)
  - All godwars bosses
  - Fully working barrows
  - Pest control
  - 4 kings (custom boss fights)
  - All godsword specials
  - Real dragon claw special
  - Turmoil prayer
  - A few custom training zones
  - Improved mining
  - Improved woodcutting
  - Lots of dupes have been fixed
  - No ugly custom items
  - Duel arena

I know the server doesn&#39;t have things that are awesome and would take a great coder to do, but thats only because I have been slowly updating the server, adding in things here and there. The server is PI and I need help with somethings that need to be fixed.

Things that I need help with
  - Webclient &amp; Forums (I just really don&#39;t want to deal with it)
  - Fix ranging (It&#39;s a bit glitched)
  - Add lunar spellbook

I am mainly looking for someone to make the webclient and the forums. I can do everything else myself, but help would be appreciated :P

If you can make webclients and forums and you can prove it, I will be more then happy to let you join asap. The webclient is probably the most important thing right now. I will buy the domain name and pay for hosting.

If you can&#39;t make a webclient and forums but you can still develop things for the server, thats good aswell. I need help on fixing ranging and adding lunar spellbook.

[b]Application form:[/b]
What you can do: (either webclient+forums or server developing)
Proof you know what your doing and you will actually do it:
Email: (you can PM it to me if you don&#39;t want to post it)
If you are making the webclient and forums, you understand that once it is made, I must have full control over both. If you ever decide to stop working on the webclient and forums, everything you have done is to be given to me. Do you understand and agree to this?:



Im also in need of one more moderator. If you would like to be one, just post your reason why you should be one.

If you become a developer, you will become an admin on the server and forums. You will have access to all the files you need to do your job. If you do not follow my rules, you will be banned from the server and all your work will be given to me.

If you want to check out the server here is a link: http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?server=district12v2.no-ip.biz</description>
