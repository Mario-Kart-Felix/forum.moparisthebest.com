    <title>GFX Delay</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gfx-delay/316127</link>
    <description>Hello... I was wondering if anyone had a GFX delay code. this is what i came up with and it works... but only the person casting the delay can see the gfx&#39;s. Basically what i&#39;m saying is that any gfx with a delay of zero can be seen by everyone, and anything higher than that can only be seen by the user. This explanation may be confusing but if you need clarification just ask.

[code]
public void stillgfx35(int id, int Y, int X, int time)
{
outStream.createFrame(85);
outStream.writeByteC(Y - (mapRegionY * 8));
outStream.writeByteC(X - (mapRegionX * 8));
outStream.createFrame(4);
outStream.writeByte(0);//Tiles away (X &gt;&gt; 4 + Y &amp; 7)
outStream.writeWord(id);//Graphic id
outStream.writeByte(0);//height of the spell above it&#39;s basic place, i think it&#39;s written in pixels 100 pixels higher
outStream.writeWord(time);//Time before casting the graphic
}
[/code]

if anyone has a code that would make it so that other people using the client could see the delayed fx, could you please give it to me or tell me a way that i could fix it. I thought that maybe it could be something with my client but i&#39;m not sure... Thank You![br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 24, 2009, 09:27:09 pm[/size][hr]lol never mind i fixed it... for anyone looking to do this, it will be in a toturial I plan on making prolly out in a week or so... Be looking for it!</description>
