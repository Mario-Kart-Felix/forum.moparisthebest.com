    <description>Well i am having problems with getting things to take affect on my server like iv been changing the emotes and start points

My home emote i first had it set a lets say 1234,1678  &lt;-fictional numbers but i changed it just a few numbers to center me more in the building and it just stays at the first cords Also i changed my 2nd emote to tele me to the freaky forester place i then decided to change it and changed the cords it still takes me to freaky forester and my other 2 emotes wont work at all but anyway continuing

I changed my Starting/Death place from Varrock to my place of choice and yet new people still spawn in varrock 

i cant figure out why its not understanding i have changed it or why it only gets like half of the emote right lol but when im done changing stuff i compile and then run and its not changed
its really bugging me

any help is greatly appreciated
