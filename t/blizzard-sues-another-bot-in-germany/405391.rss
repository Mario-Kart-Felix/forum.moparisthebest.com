    <title>Blizzard sues another bot ... in Germany</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/blizzard-sues-another-bot-in-germany/405391</link>
    <description>So some of you may remember Blizzard sued the wow bot Glider which operated under an American company, and was successful in stopping sales, distribution and got some crazy ruling about DMCA and circumvention of warden.

Now they&#39;ve gone and sued the (currently) best bot on the market Honorbuddy which operates under a company in Germany (yes, that means filing the lawsuit in Germany itself, too - gl/hf DMCA) which may have quite a few implications depending on what Blizzard are seeking damages for. There&#39;s a touch more info on their [url=http://www.thebuddyforum.com/legal/]forums[/url], however not much more than the fact that the suit was filed under reference 310 O 260/11 on 11/07/2011 before the District Court of Hamburg, and the details are not yet available.

Bot licences are still being sold, however their model has changed slightly - they no longer sell &#39;lifetime&#39; licences under the guise of not being misleading - heh. Other than that it seems business as usual, at least until all the details of the case are disclosed.

You&#39;ll probably see (some) mainstream media pick up on this more once these details are forthcoming.</description>

Cyber crime is huge but most of the judges dealing with these big cases weren’t even learning about that stuff when they were in school.  It takes a LONG time to work up that ladder…I wouldn’t be surprised if a lot of them are very comfortable with a Commodore 64.</p>

              <p>Interesting. Not quite “GF DMCA” since unfortunately a lot of American influence has crept into EU law and we’re basically as bad over here as they are now. As much as I’m not a fan of HB, I hope it goes well for them, since we all remember what a ridiculous farce the Glider case was. Nobody deserves to lose a court case on a bunch of lies and misled non-technically minded officials.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also its good of them to stop selling lifetime licences knowing their life might not be very much longer. Many wouldn’t.</p>
