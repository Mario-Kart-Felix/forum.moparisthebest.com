    <title>790 Client Download</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/790-client-download/538625</link>
    <description>Hello MoparScape Members,
Today I thought I would release a fixed 790 client for people who want to make their own RuneScape 3 Private Server. You don&#39;t have to use Eclipse for this, but you can if you want. There is still 38 warnings when compiling the client though. On top of that there is an error when running the client, but it really doesn&#39;t effect it that much and it still runs. I will probably fix it later, but as of now here you go and enjoy!

I do not have the cache, nor do I have the definitions so you can add it to your server to try to connect with it. As soon as I find out the definitions or someone else does I will post them on here and give credits to whoever.
