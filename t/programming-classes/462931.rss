    <description>So next semester I will start taking java 1 at a community college in my town. Is taking programming classes worth the money and worth the time? I could learn [i]more[/i] of it on my own but with high school plus a job, I have barely any time to devote it to learning a new language. I&#39;d like to hear some thoughts on this.

Also, I am done with high school by December 20th, which leaves me an entire semester to work and study. If you suggest books over classes what books are worth getting?</description>

<p>A class is only as good as It’s teacher. Also: Documents, Libraries, etcetera.</p>
