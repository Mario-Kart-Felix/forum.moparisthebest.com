    <title>So, my PC broke</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-my-pc-broke/301256</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s a post I left yesterday on the Techspot forum. I was wondering if any of you guys could let me know what went wrong? 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Well...It all started a couple of months ago when I found that when I tried to load up either Windows XP or Ubuntu, and my computer would just switch off as it got to the loading screen. The way I found to get round the problem (not solve it) would be to boot in to safe mode, and run a few virus and registry scans and fix any problems that were there. I would then be able to restart my computer and then boot in to Xp or Ubuntu. 

So recently, I have been leaving my computer on for about 7 days straight (I know this is really stupid of me, wasting money/electricity) but I really couldn&#39;t be bothered with booting in to safe mode everytime I wanted to use the thing. 

However, when I get back from college today, I found my computer off. I tried to turn it on, and it would begin to boot for about 2-3 seconds, and then turn itself off. This kept on happening until I held both the restart button and the power button at the same time, and then it seemed to start booting up. But then I noticed that there was no signal or data input going to my monitor. I keep trying and nothing. I&#39;ve opened up my PC numerous times, unplugged and plugged my video card a few times, and still nothing. I have used a different monitor - Nothing. I&#39;ve changed the cable two times, and still nothing going to my monitor. I&#39;ve checked all the pins, all the connections, and still nothing. I have even tried removing my video card (Nvidia 8600GT) and using the inbuilt mobo video card - Nothing at all. 

Does anyone have any ideas on what might be wrong? My thoughts are telling me that maybe a couple of things have fried out? I&#39;m guessing my PSU is screwed and maybe my mobo?

I&#39;m sorry for the longwinded post, but I have some pretty important data on the comp which I&#39;m sure is still recoverable (touch wood) but I would rather solve the problem - Even if it means buying some computer parts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Any thoughts or ideas on that would be greatly appreciated. 

My next issue is what to do next. I&#39;m going to build a PC, but there are a few problems before I do. 

Is there any way to tell whether my video card is fried or not without putting it in to another PC? All my others comps in the house are macs, and I&#39;m not sure if I can get in to another PC. When I put it in to the PC, the fan still runs, so it is still taking power. 
Would my RAM still be useable, or is it just worth getting a couple of new sticks seeing as their cheap as chips anyway. 

So basically, i&#39;m not sure what is kaput, and what is still useable, so it might just be worth buying all the parts in the end. Are all the cables still useable, or worth buying them again? 

Any help would be great.

Thanks very much</description>

              <p>Wow, im such a 'tard. Turns out I unknowingly turned AHCI on the drive, and this meant Windows couldn’t detect it. I’ve turned it off now, and Windows is installing as we speak. So looks like my problems all sorted now.</p>
<p>Another question though:<br>
Seeing as I have a 500GB HD and a 350GB HD now, I’d like to set up Windows on the 500GB and Linux on the 350GB one. To do this, is it just a matter of plugging my 350GB one in, and booting in to a LiveCD and installing on that drive? Will GRUB still work in the same way?</p>

<p>No, really, um from what it looks like wiping everything from the HDD is the best option. If you have access to another computer/extra HDD I would advise to put that HDD in the computer and run it as Slave (There’s going to be a little jumper, it looks like [], it’s by where you plug the cables in), most HDD’s show a diagram on top of how to set it to Slave, if not Google because their all different and once booted up, save all your information and reformat.</p>

              <p>ok, so an update for you guys. I bought a new mobo, processor and PSU and have attached correctly. At the moment, the comp boots up fine, get an image on the monitor, but when I try to:<br>
boot in to Windows - BSoD as expected, get to GRUB and then goes straight to the BSoD<br>
Boot in to Safe Mode - Straight to BSoD again<br>
Boot in to Ubuntu Linux - Load up the OS no problem, and I am able to read from the HD, except I don’t think I can write (I tried storing files on to a external HD and got nothing)<br>
Re-install Windows: I put the disk in to the disk drive and it gets to loading all the drivers and files it need and then it goes to the BsoD (saying that I need to check my HD for virusses and check that the hardware it correctly set up - which it is…I think)</p>
<p>I’ve tried what I can think of - Using a different cable to connect my HD to my mobo, changing the RAM etc. I’m pretty stuck right now, and have no idea what to do next. Is there anyway to complete wipe my HD using a single command in Linux (I don’t have any access to GParted or any other software like)? What’s the next step - Buy a new internal HD?</p>
<p>Thanks again guys for your help!<br>

Problem is, mopar, is that I don’t know what is working and what isn’t, as I have no way to tell whether it is booting up or not. I’m trying to connect the onboard vid card to the monitor, but there’s no signal input, and I’ve checked all of the pins, all of the wires, and nothing seems wrong. How do I reset the bios?<br>

<p>That is why you take out everything that your computer doesn’t absolutely need to boot up, and see if it boots up. (leave only CPU, and one stick of RAM in, disconnect EVERYTHING else)[/quote]<br>
you dont even need the ram, not sure if mobo will work without cpu though</p>

              <p>Fan isn’t faulty. It runs fine, and seems to have been running fine for a long time. The problem with heat is probably to do with my video card. My PSU was only 250W, and the card demanded a little more than that. I’ve done a CMOS reset, and reset the BIOS, and still the same problem.</p>
<p>Thanks so far for the helpful posts - I hope this can be fixt.</p>

              <p>Problem is, mopar, is that I don’t know what is working and what isn’t, as I have no way to tell whether it is booting up or not. I’m trying to connect the onboard vid card to the monitor, but there’s no signal input, and I’ve checked all of the pins, all of the wires, and nothing seems wrong. How do I reset the bios?</p>
<p>Hard Drive seems fine, but I’ll see if I can hook it up to something to double check.</p>
<p>It might be an overheating problem, but there isn’t any heat in it now, it’s been switched off for about 9 hours and it still wont switch on for more than a few seconds. If I hold down the power button for a little bit of time, the PC will actually stay on, but whether it is booting up I don’t know as nothing is going to the monitor.</p>

<p>i frequently use my laptop while sitting/laying on my bed (to watch house, etc), and since the bed retains a large amount of heat, sometimes the computer would just shutdown after around two hours of use while charging because of the overheat. i would wait about 10-15 seconds, then turn it on again, and it would work. however, if i tried to turn it on within the 10-15 seconds, it would appear to be booting for 2-3 seconds, then shut down again; just like yours</p>
