    <title>Odd Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/odd-question/181558</link>
    <description>I know this is going to start another religous conflict but if your Christian, or follow any other god(notice how its not capitalized) would it make you a satanic follower if you listen to a satanic band. 

Behemoth is such a great band, but they are satanic :\ so i&#39;m just afraid if i listen to them it would make me satanic etc,

What i usually go by is it won&#39;t effect you if you don&#39;t want it to and you could still enjoy music and follow whatever you want, but i&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s true anymore.</description>

No, it doesn’t make you satanic. If you are a Christian, you automaticly believe in Satan. As long as you don’t worship him, you are no Satanic person.<br>
[/quote]<br>
A satanist isn’t someone who believes in Satan.  It’s someone who follows Satan.  Nice try with the play on words, though.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s exactly what I said. Worshipper = follower.</p>

<p>[quote=“davidude36, post:7, topic:181558”]If you are worried that you will listen to it and some how be influenced to become “Satanic” then that is your own weak will power.</p>
<p>If you are strong will powered you can listen to it and not be swayed.[/quote]</p>
<p>Agreed.  Though I must say, do not overestimate your own strength.  I’ve been reading Reddit daily, a news site with an atheist streak, and their constant stabs are Christianity are always making me think about where the ignorance is… with Christians or with atheists.</p>
<p>[quote=“Cryme Time, post:1, topic:181558”]I know this is going to start another religous conflict but if your Christian, or follow any other god(notice how its not capitalized) would it make you a satanic follower if you listen to a satanic band.</p>
<p>Behemoth is such a great band, but they are satanic :\ so i’m just afraid if i listen to them it would make me satanic etc,</p>
<p>What i usually go by is it won’t effect you if you don’t want it to and you could still enjoy music and follow whatever you want, but i’m not sure if it’s true anymore.[/quote]</p>
<p>I personally don’t think it would affect you much, but you have to be your own judge on this.  I listen to plenty of music about sex, drugs, and crap like that, but I refrain from all that, especially at parties.</p>

<p>It does not make you a bad person. God [I am not Christian but I am using this as a general term for any diet(y/ies) you believe in] most likely would not have created it if he did not want you listen, would he? I am not the most religious man but I try to uphold my values and I find listening to Children of Bodom [somewhat Satanic] actually helps me stay on a straight path.</p>
