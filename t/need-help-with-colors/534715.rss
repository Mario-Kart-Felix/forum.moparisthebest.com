    <description>I have a Question/Problem
I recolor some items on my rsps like a whip
but i dont know how to get new color codes like red for example
i know you can also just take color codes from other items in class8.java
but i want to create/make new colors

How can i do this?

I know there was a tool for it HWPS? or something like this
it was a cmd tool with lots of color codes but uppit deleted it like always...
So now i have issues with getting color codes

Does anybody still have this tool?
Or can somebody explain me how to get new codes.
