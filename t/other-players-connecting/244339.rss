    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/other-players-connecting/244339</link>
    <description>ok so, i go to client.silabsoft.org and type in my ip 
&quot;youdontneedtoknow&quot;

and it works, so doesn&#39;t that mean that other people should be able to connect? yes i have no-ip and DUC and portforwarding done all correctly cause i had people on yesterday, but now they can&#39;t connect?

since i can use my ip &quot;youdon&#39;tneedtoknow&quot; and not just 127.0.0.1 doesn&#39;t that mean server is online and working properly?

shouldn&#39;t people be able to connect [u][i][b]or[/b][/i][/u] did i fuck something up?</description>

<p>and it works, so doesn’t that mean that other people should be able to connect? yes i have no-ip and DUC and portforwarding done all correctly cause i had people on yesterday, but now they can’t connect?</p>
<p>since i can use my ip “youdon’tneedtoknow” and not just 127.0.0.1 doesn’t that mean server is online and working properly?</p>
<p>shouldn’t people be able to connect <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">or</span></span></span> did i fuck something up?</p>
