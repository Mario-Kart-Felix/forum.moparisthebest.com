    <title>Updating client so other versions are not usable?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/updating-client-so-other-versions-are-not-usable/480724</link>
    <description>Hey. I just udated a client I had to make it so that cheat client cannot be used by changing the UID, anyway. I want to make a client update or something like a new client release that my players will have to use in order to play. I dont want them to be able to play with with the old client because that will allow the cheat client.</description>
