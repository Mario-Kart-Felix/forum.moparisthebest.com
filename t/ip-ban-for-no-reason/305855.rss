    <title>Ip ban for no reason?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ip-ban-for-no-reason/305855</link>
    <description>well guys i am EXTREMELY new to the forums and uhhh yeah :D.

this isnt my first time playing though....

a few months back i used to play this. best server ever. i never thought of returning to runescape ever again....

until one night. was playing with my friend and a mod. i was laughing... having a good time... but the mod said &#39;&#39;he moves and he goes bye bye&#39;&#39; *basicly me*  .  i thought he was just joking and i ran toward him saying &#39;&#39;bye bye!&#39;&#39; LOLing hard.....

then i dced. i was feeling weird now.

i attempted to log on but guess what.. i was BANNED.

i just stood there for a moment then said to myself....

I WILL JUST MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT AND ASK HIM TO UNBAN IT.


i was wrong. seconds later it came up as a black screen. then it dced me. i was worryed. i tryed to log in back to see that one is banned too! :(

it keeps happening over and over so i just...well.....gave up... :(

i then moved back to runescape.

but every now and then i need both.

anyone...please....un ip ban me....

i realy want to play..... :(</description>

This is almost the stupidest post i’ve seen yet… this board is more for server owners and coders that have issues with adding things to there server…<br>
there is absolutely no f-ing point in this post &lt;.&lt;</p>
