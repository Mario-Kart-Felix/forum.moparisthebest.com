    <description>hi i have a server that i want people to pay gp to get ads off like where you have to go to the thing on emote tab and it takes you to a small house with an npc in it saying &quot;trade with me to configure your advert settings&quot; so you trade with him and buy advert free item ( this is the part idk how to do) and it goes into your player file and changes your player rights to 9999
if you can help me... thanks if its bot possible i can just have players go turn it into the help center and i can manually change</description>
