    <title>Tutorial Island revisited</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tutorial-island-revisited/396131</link>
    <description>[size=12pt]For anyone that is interested I have a few pictures of Tutorial Island. These pictures were taken mostly yesterday (22/05/2011) some the day before.

These pictures are not faked they were done using a glitch (This is why the pictures have a mostly black mini map).

Glitch status: FIXED

This is the view from the interactive map.

This is the very first area you come to in the old tutorial. It is the place where you first learn about fire making and cooking (on a fire) for the first time. The reason it has amulet of glory examine information up is because the tutorial island effect makes any examine information come up in a message box because the main chat window is covered up by a message (As you will see below).

This is me doing the gay emote unlocked from the easter event. Here also you can see the Tutorial Progress bar clearly and also a marker which I forgot to clear on the mini map.

[img]http://i1126.photobucket.com/albums/l612/Anieli/Noclip/Tutorialemote.jpg?t=1306178639[/img]

This is the area which you enter to learn about cooking from the chef (Cooking on a Range). This is also the place you learn about the music tab before you leave the building and learn about using the run button. After this you climb underground to learn about mining, smithing and combat. Sadly I was unable get any pictures from the underground part of the tutorial.

[img]http://i1126.photobucket.com/albums/l612/Anieli/Noclip/tutorialturkey.jpg?t=1306178612[/img]

This is me in between the chapel where you learn about prayer and the Friend/Ignore system for the first time. Next to that is the very first bank most of us encountered the first time we played RuneScape 2 (I say most of use because some people got themselves killed at the combat training part of the tutorial and skipped this part out).

[img]http://i1126.photobucket.com/albums/l612/Anieli/Noclip/tutorialbank.jpg?t=1306178639[/img]

This is me at the very end of the tutorial. This is the area that you learned about Magic and after killing a chicken were eventually given the option to cast home teleport to Lumbridge.

[img]http://i1126.photobucket.com/albums/l612/Anieli/Noclip/tutorialend.jpg?t=1306178639[/img]

This is just a random picture of the tutorial island effect still active off the island (Even though the Progress bar vanished when I walked away).

[img]http://i1126.photobucket.com/albums/l612/Anieli/Noclip/Tutorialislandeffect.jpg?t=1306178639[/img]

I hope you found this interesting. Not many people get the opportunity to visit it now days so I thought I would post a few pictures for those interested. For those that wonder why I didn&#39;t go down a level it was simply because I couldn&#39;t.[/size]</description>

<p>Even if you did post uncensored pictures you probably wouldn’t get banned if Jagex found them but since I was caught at the place where you set it up by Mod Alex L I didn’t want to risk it. Some people who were helping others do it without even doing it themselves got banned.</p>

<p>Thank you for believing. The fishing trawler no clip was approx 120 tile ‘no clip’. This one was a measly one tile noclip (Hence why I couldn’t go to the bottom level of tutorial like he did). The methods for stalling the Force move have now been patched along with the force move itself. If you tried it now you would walk into the wall and appear in the same place you just released it.</p>
