    <title>Is there a 06 server out there that can stay on!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-a-06-server-out-there-that-can-stay-on/496042</link>
    <description>This is somewhat of a rant, but partly to look for a server that fits what I am looking for.

I have been on 5 different 06 servers in the last month and a half and they keep shutting down for some reason. Only on one occasion did I quit one of those servers due to the fact that it went off line very often and it lagged so much that I died repeatedly losing my best items (and the economy was appositely terrible, so getting back said items was less than easy) on numerous times. 

I am lucky if I get a single day off from work, so I cant keep putting in effort into a server and then having it gone the next day or having it off line the only day I happen to be able to unwind. My requirements are simple (I think).

Active staff that is able to restart a server if it goes off
little to no off time
06 or earlier
no godwars
no summoning, dungeonering or hunting
working barrows
all nps have correct OR better drops that normal
all or least 95% of npcs
all skills working
xp rate of 5x or more
xp rate to not lower or at least lock for each player
the newer the better
NO 07 Runescape

Is this rely so much to ask for? I will give Moparscape one last chance to show me it can provide a server I can enjoy.</description>

<p>Who am I? I am just someone attempting to find some entertainment on my free time. I do not see how I am “acting like some god”. Many games that largely run on servers often have a section for their players to seek a server of their liking. This one just so happens to seem like the best fit for that and I did not see any rules regarding this. If this is not the correct place for this topic I will gladly ask for it closed and have this posted in the correct area. If this topic is not allowed on this site then I will abandon it and look on another related site where this topic is allowed.</p>
<p>Again this topic is not intended to insult anyone, it is partially a rant.</p>
<p>As for adding my job, I posted a related topic for another game (on another site), of which I was asked “why do you want to find a server so badly” The best answer in a short version was “I have little time to hunt for said server type” of which I was further asked by another member why this was, to which I responded briefly that I have a job that requires much of my time. So this is why I felt the need to briefly explain about my job, to hopefully quell unrelated questions to this topic. Perhaps I was too cert about it as it is a partial rant.</p>

              <p>This is somewhat of a rant, but partly to look for a server that fits what I am looking for.</p>
<p>I have been on 5 different 06 servers in the last month and a half and they keep shutting down for some reason. Only on one occasion did I quit one of those servers due to the fact that it went off line very often and it lagged so much that I died repeatedly losing my best items (and the economy was appositely terrible, so getting back said items was less than easy) on numerous times.</p>
<p>I am lucky if I get a single day off from work, so I cant keep putting in effort into a server and then having it gone the next day or having it off line the only day I happen to be able to unwind. My requirements are simple (I think).</p>
<p>Active staff that is able to restart a server if it goes off<br>
little to no off time<br>
06 or earlier<br>
no godwars<br>
no summoning, dungeonering or hunting<br>
working barrows<br>
all nps have correct OR better drops that normal<br>
all or least 95% of npcs<br>
all skills working<br>
xp rate of 5x or more<br>
xp rate to not lower or at least lock for each player<br>
the newer the better<br>
NO 07 Runescape</p>
<p>Is this rely so much to ask for? I will give Moparscape one last chance to show me it can provide a server I can enjoy.</p>
