    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-server/184169</link>
    <description>OK so, i got my no-ip, im on a laptop so i portforwarded, and i opened the port in my firewall.  I can get on the server with localhost, but other people cant get on it.  What did i do wrong?

And do i have to have a static IP or dynamic, or it doesnt matter?</description>
