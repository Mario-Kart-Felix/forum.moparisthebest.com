    <title>Need help with my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-server/246671</link>
    <description>Hi all, I&#39;m pretty new here but I need some help starting up my server onto a &#39;dedicated&#39; one. I have my own server and everything that I have been renting but I don&#39;t know how to upload my server files onto there and also how to set it up so people can play by using the server instead of my computer... thanks a lot!</description>
