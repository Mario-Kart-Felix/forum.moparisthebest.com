    <title>Need help with my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-server/109760</link>
    <description>Okay ive got my server up and running, and im trying out new stuff and editing it before i port forward so other people can log on. I have one really REALLY big problem though. My server has been working for about a day now, but about an hour ago I tried a command and it just froze. Now everytime i try to log on, it says i have disconnected and my moparscape just freezes. Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?</description>
