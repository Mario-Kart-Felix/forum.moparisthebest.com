-pk zone.
-make admin-mod bases.
-have people join my server.
-how to make walls and doors.
-make a new training spot.
-how to change my pimpscape to different name.

and i know how to make people go to my bases but it doesnt work i dont know my router and when i go on address bar and type 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1 it never works i dont know whats wronge mostly i want to have people join my server and make admin spots and mod spots and deffinetly change pimpscape to a different name because when ever i logg on to my server it says welcome to PimpScape and i want it to say a different thing.
