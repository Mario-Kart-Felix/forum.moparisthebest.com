              <p>ok yes now your runing the server <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
are you using hamatchi ? then just run it under your own hamatchi ip or use the default  Ip for normal mopar, (you will be the only one on it)<br>
see what youv just done is run the server you need something to host it (the hamatchi or defualt ip) to play it</p>
