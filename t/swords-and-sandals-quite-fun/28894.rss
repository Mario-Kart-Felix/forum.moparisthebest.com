Pretty fun when you&#39;re really bored [b]HORRIBLE GRAPHICS[/b] Though.

Furthest i&#39;ve been up to is level 3 boss then i died :(

Pros
-Fun when you&#39;re really bored and have nothing to do
-No download required
-quite easy to get use to
cons
-Horrible graphics and weapons and armour look funny.
-when you die you lose everything and have to start from scratch

[b]Info on gameplay[/b]

[b]strength[/b]
strength determines how much damage your character dishes out and also affects the height and weight of your character stronger characters can push weaker characters further

[b]agility[/b]
agility represents your characters speed faster characters can move into and out of combat more easily and perform spectacular acrobatic leaps.

[b]Attack[/b]
your attack score is your overall offensive weapon skill. gladiators with high attack tend to hit there enemies more offen finding gaps in armour with masterful precision

[b]defence[/b]
defence is a vital part of protecting yourself in combat. a high defencesive score means you&#39;ll get hit less

[b]Vitality[/b]
your vitality represents your overall health. for every vitality you point you add you&#39;ll receive 7hitpoints. each time you level up, you also receive 7hitpoints. gladiators with high vitality take a lot longer to kill

[b]Charasima[/b]
Charasima reflects your overall charm and likeability.characters with high charisma please the crowd. Winning you more gold for winning fights. shopkeepers will lower their prices by 2percent for every charisma point you have

[b]Stamina[/b]
every leap every parry or hack you perform in the arena takes some of your energy.more powerful attacks and leaps really sap your energy. the higher your stamina the faster you will recover both energy and your health. if your energy runs low your character will miss a turn and fall asleep

[b]Notes For Walkthrough(coming soon)[/b]

Just found out that starting with 5strength 2attack 5vitality will get me pass 1st boss without dying [b](raising 1 strength 1attack 1vitality level per combat level)[/b]

[b]Strategy (how we will kill bosses and enemies)[/b]
(keep taunting till they come near you and attack)

[b]1.[/b]kill all enemys and boss no.1 
(Using the strategy)

[b]2.[/b]Then kill the next enemy and purchase a cutpurse armour plate, shinguards and boots
Rule: (do not buy any weapons only armour) Get weapons from bosses.

[b]3.[/b]Kill the next enemy and purchase cutpurse greaves gaunts and shoulderguards

[b]4.[/b] Kill the boss with strategy and take his sword! you&#39;re attack should be 6 and you&#39;re strength and vitality 9

[b]5.[/b] kill the next enemy and purchase &quot;brigand shield&quot;

[b]6.[/b]kill the next enemy and purchase &quot;brigand boot&quot; &quot;Brigand shins&quot; and  &quot;Brigand greaves&quot;
[b]7.[/b] kill next enemy and purchase &quot;brigand gaunts&quot; and &quot;brigand shoulder guards&quot;
[b]8.[/b]kill next enemy this time get 1 attack and 2 on strength 
you should be 12strength 8attack 10vitality
