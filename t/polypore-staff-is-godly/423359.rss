    <title>Polypore Staff is godly</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/polypore-staff-is-godly/423359</link>
    <description>This is the new weapon that was released with the Polypore dungeon. I got mine for 4M, and I&#39;m using it at barrows. I have to say that it is AMAZING. Its a magic weapon with 3,000 charges, easily hitting higher than fire surge. It requires no runes, and can be recharged with polypore spores, which can be dropped on slayer tasks and by everything in the Polypore dungeon. So with the staff costing only about 200gp per cast, its quite amazing, and I recommend that everyone with 80 attack and magic should try it :) just keep in mind you need 80 farming to recharge it (which is assistable).

And just for an example of how well it is, I did 2 barrows runs in melee armor with 60 casts. They were very fast and I believe it can easily pay for the staff.</description>

The items crashed because everyone expected them to be a 1/5000 chance drop, meaning that out of thousands of players slaying, the economy would get like 4 of the item, which would promptly be bought out by merchants to ensure no one got to use them. This time Jagex added common drops that add up over time so even unlucky players can eventually get their due share, and merchants can’t buy them out.</p>
<p>As for the gear, the staff is a godsend for high level mages, allowing for the use of lunar spells at the same time, and giving them a cheap option for doing things like slayer without having to resort to fire bolt to avoid breaking bank. The armor degrades asininely quickly, but just like the PvP gear, its short life can be justified by its power, and once the flake prices go down a bit, it’s still cheaper to use in pvp than that gear. It has torva slash/crush defense, outstrips pernix’s magic defense, better magic bonuses than ahrim’s, and the most asininely huge soaks in the game. This gives it some worthwhile reason to be used. If it ruins hybridding as you claim, fight the person with ranged and stab attacks, the armor gives virtually NO defense to those styles, so if they’re expecting to be invincible in the gear, you’ll tear them to shreds in moments, to keep balance.</p>
<p>On top of that, the gear takes farming/crafting to make, so there’s a reason to get those skills up. 98 crafting for uber ultimate 85 armor is more fitting than 99 smithing for a r00n platebody.</p>
<p>Magic got a cheap option, magic got lunar spells, slayers got a mageable monster with great seed loots. Skillers got something new to make, pkers got new super armor more manageable than the pvp gear, the gear has super powers AND drawbacks, and the degrading factors (it might rule out the gear for casual use, but for tense battles like dangerous pvp or people who have spare money, it will be used) mean that the common drops allow slayers at high levels to have steady income.</p>
