    <title>Adobe Digital Editions?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adobe-digital-editions/162357</link>
    <description>Hello,
I have found myself in a predicament. I have a history quiz tomorrow, and need to study from my textbook, which happens to be an eBook that is opened with Adobe Digital Editions. It works on my desktop computer, which is downstairs and is unmovable. I however need this book for school, and need to study it on my laptop, however whenever I try to open it it says I need to open it on that computer. Is there anything I can do, or am I boned?
Thanks
