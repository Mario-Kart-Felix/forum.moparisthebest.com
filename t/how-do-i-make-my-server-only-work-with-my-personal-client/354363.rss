<p>If its true about what “Puffy Pain” said about stopping the cheater clients then your in the WRONG SECTION. its client side <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Person above me trying to raise his/her post count, he is trying to ask if there is a way of making people only able to play on his server with his client. Meaning people cannot make cheat clients and be able to connect to his server, it will disconnect them.</p>

              <p>ok so let me get this right.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>u want your client ONLY to be able to access your server so no 1 else can go online?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>u want it so people can go on cheat clients or <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> to play your server</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3.if u only want your self to access your server and are in the same house with the same ip you can change the ip in your client to 127.0.0.1 and also change the ip in your server to 127.0.0.1 so only any in in your household can access your game.</p>
<p>Please enplane more in your question!</p>
