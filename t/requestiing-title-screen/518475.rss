    <description>so i&#39;ve gotten everything to Download. My cache is downloaded right. but as soon as it&#39;s done downloading it has a screen that says &quot;requesting title scree&quot; Connection error - trying in 20 19 18 ... i know that my cache is downloaded right because when i go to my directory it has all the files needed for it but i just get this error. Am i possibly doing something wrong?</description>
