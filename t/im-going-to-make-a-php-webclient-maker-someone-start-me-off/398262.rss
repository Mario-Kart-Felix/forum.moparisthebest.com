              <p>Your best interest, as of right now, is to make a simple HTML code that will feed the IP and PORT via parameters to the client. From there, you can build it around to work via the URL. Building from there, would be a form to make a new MySQL database that would hold the different IP/Port/Name combinations, and a page to be able to sort through and make a list, as well as being able to register. As said though, make sure you client can dynamically get the IP and Port via the parameters first. The rest should slowly be built ontop of that.</p>
