    <title>Everything is working but my server won&#39;t work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/everything-is-working-but-my-server-wont-work/343421</link>
    <description>I made a silabsoft server and it just won&#39;t work! My port is open 43594. My firewall is off. I-P is set to mine and when I hit runserver it says it&#39;s running but i don&#39;t get anything on silabsoft. Also, when I run compiler it says 
Note:stream.java overrides a deprecated API.
Note: recompile with -xlint:deprecation for details.
Press any key to continue. Is it supposed to do that and PLEASE HELP FIX MY SERVER. I CAN DO TEAMVIEWER IF YOU LIKE!!!</description>
