Okay, we’ll have fun seeing your “release” go right to the back.</p>
<p>Also, if I remember correctly, server’s aren’t made by jagex, they’re made by users. The cache and client (People do make their own client though) are jagex’s work though.</p>
<p>So logically, the source (which is the part you edited) is not Jagex’s, and therefore you should credit it’s maker.</p>

        <p>Lol as I explained in my post above they decompile the client and make their own server. This does not make the game their property the server is their property. They also did not create the runescape protocol so they can’t take credit for that and they did not make the client so they can’t take credit for that. Basically this is somebody elses game and I only contribute to servers for experience as its fun I enjoy it. I don’t run servers publically for others to play I just enjoy writing code. I am currently working on my own online multiplayer game. Runescape is no ones work but Jagex and don’t blab on about how the server was written by somebody we are all aware of that. The point is this is somebody else’s game and I am not bothered about promoting a release that is why their is so little content. I was just interested to share my changes and to hear feed back from people.</p>

<p>Yeah, they decompile the client and then make a server around it. It still takes a huge amount of work to do so. Don’t believe me? Then try it. Go play the current copy of runescape, get the client, decompile it, then make a working server based off that.</p>

<p>Runescape is the work of many talented programmers coming together. Each person was paid and or accredited for their work by Jagex. We are not talking about runescape. We’re talking about a <span class="bbcode-b">private server based on runescape</span></p>
