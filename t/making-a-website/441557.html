        <p>Generally I can make my own sites, but I simply don’t have the skills for the one my friend would like(the one who wants it) he wants me to sort it out for him because he is more of a novice than I am and knows nobody else (that he can at least trust) to sort it out for him without ripping him off.<br>
My friend wants a website which can have a community on it where they can chat and so forth(live chat + forums) events and so forth. Its to do with his music project so he’d want to post his music stuff. He was very vague and I’m getting him to give me more information so i’ll add more detail to this thread when I get more information.<br>
He liked this template <a href="http://templates.entheosweb.com/template_number/30842.asp" rel="nofollow noopener">http://templates.entheosweb.com/template_number/30842.asp</a> and he liked the functionality of this website <a href="http://www.gorgeousgamers.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.gorgeousgamers.com/</a><br>
I have a budget of lets say $600 and a time scale of about 2 months to do it. Know of any sites which could make such a site etc? Preferably ones which you can personally be involved in the design process to make sure it is going in the direction he wants in to go in.<br>
Sorry about the vague information supplied, in advance thanks for any suggestions/help I’ll be given :).</p>
