    <title>Bye everyone</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bye-everyone/18193</link>
    <description>Well,not alot of you know me but i thought i&#39;d announce me leaving,i have had a pretty hectic life on these forums.I will be mentioning all the people who i respect and who have helped me over the months,

flamed fury1:This is the person i respect the most on these forums,he tought me all i know before he came along i was so dumb i was asking the javac not recognised error, he took me under his wing theoreticly and tought me all.

bigmac: he tought me all i know about graphics before him i could use a magic wand tool. He tought me all to do with graphics and then the kind people of the graphics community built on the foundations

pookey71: me and him have been good friends,both quitting and well me and him have a understanding if that is the word that would suit the most.

fastballz:same as bigmac mostly except me and him dont talk much.He just helped me with my problems along the way, he wrote some tutorials that were custom made for me i think, every question i would ask he would answer or make a tut.

I&#39;ve quit because ?

Moparscape is gettin too many leechers these days and no-one can make a source,tutorial with out someone leeching it, plus i have my gcse&#39;s to sort out,i have all my life to sort out i used to think why do all the people who i respect quiting becuase of leechers/or the same reason as me gcse. Well now i see it gets really frustrating.


i also thank mopar and all the mods, you have kept this wunderus site up and runing and also clean its by far the bet community i have been in and the kindest u will be sorely missed</description>

ok, make making a leaving thread result in a ban, then they cant lie.<br>

yeah i think this is a good idea, ban the people who are leaving then they cannot come back meaning they cannot lie.[/quote]<br>

              <p>See ya later man, I don’t know you but thanks for being a part of the forums. Also yes there are alot of people “leaving” and whether they all are telling the truth or not doesn’t matter unless they don’t actually leave. Now if they were dumb enough to say that they were leaving and stay around everyone will hate them anyways which would probably cause them too leave anyways. So in the long run anyone who posts something like this, whether it maybe the truth or not, should still have our respect in saying good bye to them because like I said if they’re looking for attention this is sure the best way to not get any(atleast any positive) attention.</p>

              <p>Well,not alot of you know me but i thought i’d announce me leaving,i have had a pretty hectic life on these forums.I will be mentioning all the people who i respect and who have helped me over the months,</p>
<p>flamed fury1:This is the person i respect the most on these forums,he tought me all i know before he came along i was so dumb i was asking the javac not recognised error, he took me under his wing theoreticly and tought me all.</p>
<p>bigmac: he tought me all i know about graphics before him i could use a magic wand tool. He tought me all to do with graphics and then the kind people of the graphics community built on the foundations</p>
<p>pookey71: me and him have been good friends,both quitting and well me and him have a understanding if that is the word that would suit the most.</p>
<p>fastballz:same as bigmac mostly except me and him dont talk much.He just helped me with my problems along the way, he wrote some tutorials that were custom made for me i think, every question i would ask he would answer or make a tut.</p>
<p>I’ve quit because ?</p>
<p>Moparscape is gettin too many leechers these days and no-one can make a source,tutorial with out someone leeching it, plus i have my gcse’s to sort out,i have all my life to sort out i used to think why do all the people who i respect quiting becuase of leechers/or the same reason as me gcse. Well now i see it gets really frustrating.</p>
<p>i also thank mopar and all the mods, you have kept this wunderus site up and runing and also clean its by far the bet community i have been in and the kindest u will be sorely missed</p>
