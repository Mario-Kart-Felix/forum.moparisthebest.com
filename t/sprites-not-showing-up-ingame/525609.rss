    <title>Sprites not showing up ingame</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sprites-not-showing-up-ingame/525609</link>
    <description>My friend and I are currently working on a server together and we are having trouble with a number of sprites not showing up ingame.  We are using trisidiax as our server base. Things such as emote icons, the X in the top right of the bank and the buttons at the bottom of the equipment tab are not appearing.  Any help with being able to locate and load these sprites would be appreciated.</description>

              <p>Either the sprites are missing from the cache or the path to locate them is wrong. RSInterface.java contains all the methods for building the custom interfaces, you should start your search there.</p>
