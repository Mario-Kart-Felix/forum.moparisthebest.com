    <description>So I&#39;m currently in my junior year of hs, which, here in America, is the year of college preparation. The only issue is, I have no idea what I want to do.There are things I know I&#39;m not interested, however I just don&#39;t enjoy the idea of selecting one field that I have to do. 

In classes, I&#39;ve always been more of a history/English person. While I have understandings of sciences and math, I don&#39;t majorly enjoy them. For example, when talking about things like quantum mechanics and theories of the universe, I like to theorize, not use math to examine things. 

What I feel is that the job market is having a demand for more of the technology based careers. I do have some hope for the re-age of personal service and communications, however only in select fields. So what do you guys recommend? I want some sort of field where I don&#39;t have to be glued in one spot, but also has potential unlike some shitty liberal art.</description>

<p>Become a pharmacist. Studies would be, on the general aspect, biology and chemistry. You’d also be required to ethics classes, etc. Roughly 5-6 years of schooling. Pays 80-100 grand a year. Get cash to count pills. Win at life.</p>
<p>The issue I have is the stationary aspect. I’d prefer some sort of sales job with a flat $25,000 a year, with a $100,000 commission cap. I like the motivation and the strive to work. I just couldn’t do any “safe” 10 year contract, moderate benefits, $52,000 a year desk job. I’d blow my brains out.</p>

              <p>same here i’m currently a senior and our home school didn’t really help us one bit, but we also got enrolled into a trade school witch is partners with our home school and they have been VERY helpful im in the emerging technologies class which programs and we’ve had college reps college fairs and tours of colleges through them also do research i suggest <a href="http://bigfuture.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">bigfuture.com</a> or <a href="http://myfuture.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">myfuture.com</a> we came across this because our project is creating a college calculation website and just by doing that research it helps alot you wont really know everything until your actually in college i think personally just like high school experience it to know it</p>
<p>But just google some college information but cost is a main thing and your act score/sat score and gpa<br>
and you can always switch colleges my plan is to attend Delta community college cost are lower and also i get finacial aid so it wont be that expensive after i spend 2 years there im going to get a major in computer science and minor in buisness.</p>
<p>So just look for colleges that are in your price range, community colleges cheaper than universities, make sure the school offers classes you like, theres tons more info but it’s just a google click away <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> hopefully you can understand all of this kinda rambled on for a bit haha</p>

              <p>You can always double major in college or major in one subject and minor in another. I had no idea about college at all until I went to a college fair. Surely your school offers some type of program to see what colleges offer or maybe a local college fair.</p>

              <p>So I’m currently in my junior year of hs, which, here in America, is the year of college preparation. The only issue is, I have no idea what I want to do.There are things I know I’m not interested, however I just don’t enjoy the idea of selecting one field that I have to do.</p>
<p>In classes, I’ve always been more of a history/English person. While I have understandings of sciences and math, I don’t majorly enjoy them. For example, when talking about things like quantum mechanics and theories of the universe, I like to theorize, not use math to examine things.</p>
<p>What I feel is that the job market is having a demand for more of the technology based careers. I do have some hope for the re-age of personal service and communications, however only in select fields. So what do you guys recommend? I want some sort of field where I don’t have to be glued in one spot, but also has potential unlike some shitty liberal art.</p>
