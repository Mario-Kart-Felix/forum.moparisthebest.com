    <title>Port Forwarding - Connection Refused?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwarding-connection-refused/543551</link>
    <description>Hey. Not sure if I can post this here. If I can&#39;t then please let me know. Anyway, I am trying to port forward. I am logged into my router, and on the website I went to Port Forward. I set the External and Internal starting and ending ports at 43594. It says that is correct. So I go to canyouseeme, and they said they couldn&#39;t see my port. So I run my server, and retry it, and it still says my port isnt open. Any help please? I believe I followed the tutorial correct, but I still cant figure this out. Thanks.


Can You See Me:
Error: I could not see your service on (my IP) on port (43594)
Reason: Connection refused</description>

<p>Yes, I’ve made sure my port in my server is 43594. Now instead of Connection Refused, I am getting Connection Timed Out. :s is that worse?</p>
<blockquote>Firewall. Your firewall is blocking it.
Whether it is your windows firewall, antivirus, or router firewall, the connection is being denied.</blockquote>
<p>I’ve allowed it through my Windows Firewall. I’ll check the others.</p>
<p>EDIT: I just disabled my firewalls to test it, and it still said Connection Timed Out.</p>
