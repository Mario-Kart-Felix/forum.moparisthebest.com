    <title>Can&#39;t connect to my 562 client on the IP: 127.0.0.1?</title>

    <description>I recently deleted my Jdk due to an error I had with java therefore I had to delete Jdk. This could be something to do with me deleting the Jdk but I&#39;m not sure. I was looking through a few old files and found my old 562 client. Its on the IP: 127.0.0.1, everything runs correctly but I can&#39;t connect to the server? Please get back to me as soon as you can if you have any idea what this could be, Thanks.

[b]Edit:[/b] Also I tried to download like 3 other package&#39;s from here and they say the same thing, &quot;Error Connecting To Server&quot;, so I have no idea what it is. It can&#39;t be any of the files though, I don&#39;t think..</description>

              <p>Its not necessary the ip that’s wrong, in your source you might find something called “run” you must run that then you can connect. If you want other players joining, make a no-ip host and change it to that…</p>
<p>… if this doesn’t work then try ip= 0.0.0.0</p>
