    <description>I tried loading Silab Client earlier today, and a white screen came up saying:

Error_loader_client - Unable to download client.
silabclient was unable to download the client file 


Login to your computer as an &#39;administator&#39; user, and then try loading silabclient again. This should give it sufficient access to create save client cache file. 


Or, create a new directory called C:\WINDOWS\.silabclient_store_32 or /.silabclient_store_32. If possible, set that directory to have full read+write permissions so that all users can write to it. silabclient should then detect that directory and use it for its files. 


Make sure to accept the java signature it looks like this: &quot;

Why is this happening ?
I&#39;ve done everything it suggested, but it still won&#39;t work.. P.S, I didn&#39;t know where else to post this so i posted it here..
Any Help Is Apreciated Greatly, Thanks.</description>
