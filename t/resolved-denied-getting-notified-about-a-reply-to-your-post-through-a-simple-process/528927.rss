    <title>[RESOLVED - DENIED]Getting Notified About a Reply To Your Post Through a Simple Process</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-denied-getting-notified-about-a-reply-to-your-post-through-a-simple-process/528927</link>
    <description>Hello! I was thinking, &quot;It&#39;s such a pain to have to go through my post history to find what I have posted to see if someone replied&quot; so I thought up a simple process to help fix this. How about, to reply to someones post you write

@(username)

 to make it even less of a hassle, make a button that says &quot;reply to (username)&quot;

and whenever the @(username) symbol was located in the text of someones post. It would notify (toggle-able) the user with that username that someone has replied to them on (this) post.

Please post your opinions.</description>

<p>Well not really. Remember the good old youtube reply system? When you hit reply it would start off the reply with @(otherpersonsusername) (text) Thats sorta how I would prefer it.</p>
<p>And its not subscribing at all. Basically, if someone types in <a class="mention" href="/u/docent">@Docent</a>, I would get a notification through email or whatever saying that this person replied to my post on this thread.</p>
