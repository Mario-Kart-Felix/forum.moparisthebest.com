    <title>Need Cleaned Small Client!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-cleaned-small-client/391302</link>
    <description>Probably Delta based client, or whatever you have that&#39;s VERY SMALL and CLEANED OUT.

I DO NOT have ANY CUSTOMS on my server including Godswords, Dragon Claws, Barrows, or any other p2p item except whip, glory, etc...

So I don&#39;t need a 15+ MB Client that does.

All I need is one that has clipped gates, etc... Since some don&#39;t have that corrected.</description>

<p>Clipped gates are server-side I believe. At least for Npcs.</p>
