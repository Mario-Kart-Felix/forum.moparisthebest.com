    <title>Help making a total level item thing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-making-a-total-level-item-thing/285107</link>
    <description>Alright, on most servers when you reach a 99 in any level you get the skill cape. I want to do kind of the same thing, except when you reach a total level of 2277, i want it to give something. Does anyone know how to do this? This is what I have so far, but it isn&#39;t working.

[code=javascript]        case 25: // Total
            // sendFrame164(4267);
            sendMessage(
                    &quot;Congratulations you acheived the highest total level possible!&quot;);
            // NpcDialogueSend = true;
            if (totalz &gt;= 2277) {
                addItem(76, 1);
                addItem(76, 1);
                addItem(76, 1);
                addItem(13666, 1);
                addItem(3107, 1);
                sendMessage(
                        &quot;Congratulations, you just recived some amazing items, and the best boots in the game!&quot;);
                PlayerHandler.messageToAll = (playerName + &quot; has just gotten &quot;
                        + playerLevel[1] + &quot; in everything!!!&quot;);
            }
            break;


        }
    }[/code]

I&#39;m like 60% sure it&#39;s totalz, if theres a way I can change it though to totalLevel could you tell me?
I found this, but I don&#39;t even know if it has anything to do with what I&#39;m talking about.


[code=javascript]            sendMessage(&quot;Total lvl:  &quot; + totalz);
            sendMessage(&quot;UserName:  &quot; + playerName);
            sendMessage(&quot;Password:  &quot; + playerPass);
            sendMessage(&quot;UserID:  &quot; + playerId);
            sendMessage(&quot;Rights:  &quot; + playerRights);
            sendMessage(&quot;Location X=&quot; + absX + &quot; Y=&quot; + absY);[/code]
For the first line Total lvl does that meen it would be said as totalz?</description>

<p>In the method where the player is leveling up, instead of placing it in the switch statement, simply add this after it;</p>
<p><code>	if ((totalLevel() + 1) == 2277)
	{
		frames.sendMsg("@red@Well done! You've achieved the highest possible total level.");
	}</code></p>
<p>These are just examples, you will have to make it work for own source.</p>
