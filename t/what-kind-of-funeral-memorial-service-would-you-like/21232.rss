    <title>What kind of funeral/memorial service would you like?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-kind-of-funeral-memorial-service-would-you-like/21232</link>
    <description>In the past little while, it seems as if I have been to a lot of funerals. I believe around 5-6 months it was, when a really good friend of mine died. Well just last sunday I lost 3 more close friends because of a car crash. The scary thing was, I was going to go with them but I decided not to. Although, then again, the timing would be completly different if I had gone. Anyways, today was the memorial service at school. I was sad to hear what happened, but this memorial service today made me feel really depressed. All that sad music, people crying, etc.. I cried(although minorly) for the first time in at least 5 years today. It didn&#39;t feel good though, so I realized from there that I want a fun funural when I die. None of that really depressing music, I want rock music playing really loud. I want cake for everyone + seconds, and I just want them to not worry about my death and just have fun. 

What kind of funural or memorial service would you like to have in the event of your death?</description>
