    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;A gunman has opened fire at a nursing home in the US state of North Carolina, killing six people at the scene, and two others who died later in hospital.

A police officer and the gunman were among those injured in the incident in the town of Carthage, police said.

Police units at Pinelake Health and Rehab Center, where the gunman opened fire at 1000 local time (1500 GMT).

A 45-year-old man is under arrest, and will be charged with eight murders, a local district attorney said.

&quot;At this time the suspect, Robert Stewart, is in custody facing these eight counts of murder, felony assault on a law enforcement officer, and other charges are pending at this time,&quot; said Maureen Krueger, Moore County district attorney.

The man is not believed to be related to any of the residents at the home.

Seven residents and one nurse were among the fatalities.

The facility, about 60 miles (100 km) south-west of Raleigh, has 90 beds and specialises in caring for people with Alzheimer&#39;s disease.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
