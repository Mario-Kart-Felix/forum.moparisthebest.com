    <title>Okkkay, little problem with Portforwarding (Not the average)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/okkkay-little-problem-with-portforwarding-not-the-average/401540</link>
    <description>Okay, so, I HAVE portforwarded correctly before, just on a different router. This one&#39;s strange... Instead of like, Linksys or something, it&#39;s a WIFI connection. It&#39;s a Dell Wireless 1397 WLAN Mini-Card.

Okay, so, the options it has for anything to do with Ports when I connect to 192.168.1.1 are Port Forwarding and Port Filtering.

Instead of being able to make new Applications in Port Forwarding, theirs pre-set ones. Ex; DNS. Then, they have the &quot;IP Address on WLAN&quot; column.

Then, the Port Filtering apparently just allows any port if disabled, but when enabled, only allows the selected ones (Theirs an option here for a custom port to be allowed) I HAVE tried to enable Port Filtering and then add a custom port 43594 to be allowed, which also didn&#39;t work.

If you got any suggestions that you could give me, that&#39;d be greatly appreciated. I really want to be able to use this internet connection as a secondary source in case my main Linksys internet goes down:\</description>
