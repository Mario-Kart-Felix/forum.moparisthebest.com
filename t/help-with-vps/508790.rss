    <title>Help with vps!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-vps/508790</link>
    <description>I sincerely apologize if this is in the wrong section as I am new to these forums!

Ok so first of all I just bought a vps and I need to know around how many players this can hold.

Specs:

Ram: 1gb
Disk Space: 25gb
Monthly Transfer: 150gb
Virtual Cpu Allocation: 1vCPU
Port Speed: 100mbps/1gbps
Windows 2008

Also do I have to open ports and stuff like that? Answers are very much appreciated. Thanks!
