    <title>Help with vps</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-vps/445653</link>
    <description>Hello. I have a client and source and i am going to be editing it later tomorrow and making it a webclient also. I have a free VPS but i need to know how i set my Source and client online with it. 
My VPS is a Linux CentOS 6 32bit server. I have JDK installed already. Do i use my ip address for my VPS? Would i use my VPS ip (ip is 94.249.172.230) as my server ip?

If so then how would i start the server in a SSH client so that i can get the webclient to run properly so that all people in the public area could login to the server and play against each other in PK? 

Also would i have to upload my source folder? and if so where would i upload it?

Thanks i would like to finally have my own server that runs 24/7 and i already have Screen installed i just need to run the server and stuff.</description>
