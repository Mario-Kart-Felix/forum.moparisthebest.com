              <p>I’m not trying to be mean but try to learn how to do a public non-hamachi server. hamachi is just a waste and their is nothing to help you with here but your trying to get players is what i think. So i would personally consider this as advertisement.</p>

<p>Hamachi doesn’t use that server ip. It’s usually an IP address (looks like 53.127.48.4)</p>
