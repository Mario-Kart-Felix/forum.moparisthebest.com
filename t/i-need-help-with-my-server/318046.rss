    <title>I need help with my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-my-server/318046</link>
    <description>I have a runescape private server that runs on silab called radrs.sytes.net I own it as owner z but apparently it seems like i can only connect to it! i got a linksys router got the java and all the firewall parts set got it portforwarded and everything i need to. I havent had a actual person test it yet besides myself and i tried posting it on mopar server status and it says The server Radrs is offline, it must be online before you can register it here. I really need help on finding out how to get it online to other! i got no-ip all set up too!
