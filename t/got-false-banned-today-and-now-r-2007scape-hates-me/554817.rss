Me: &quot;I would at least like to know what drew you to this conclusion.&quot;

Him: &quot;Many people would, but to answer that question I would need to tell you how our bot detection system works. I am not going to do that.&quot;

<p>Another fun one was when jagex added grotesque souls.  took a few hours but everyone realized you can sell them to the general store for 2k each even though ge value was auto set at 7.5k.  made about 20m off of that, i was lucky enough to get off the hook without a ban.</p>

              <p>imo the reason they’re not transparent about bot detection is that parts of it have a % chance that it’ll throw false positives and they can’t be bothered deciding which excuses to accept. i’m guessing most bots don’t do any of the easy shit anymore (like clicking the exact same coordinate or pixel colour) so they have to rely on stuff like playing for 48 hours straight, meaning they have to accept a % of people get falsely banned. i find it a bit strange that so many people on reddit have 100% faith in what jagex are saying when there’s no way any system could determine who’s botting with 100% accuracy.</p>

A) You were botting but you’re in hella denial.</p>
<p>or B) Their bot detection system is actually garbage, flagged you as a false positive, and they rolled with it in an attempt to make themselves look better.[/quote]B. I’ve only botted on RSC with APOS because they don’t monitor RSC, but I know they actively monitor OSRS so it would fudgeing stupid to bot knowing they will ban you. Some people have the audacity to think that I would suddenly start botting just now after working on the account for a couple years. Go figure.</p>
<p>The only thing that changed between now and the last several months of playing was that I played unusual hours over the last month or so due to shit sleep schedule from getting back to university.</p>

we’ll never know if you actually botted, but who knows. Not to be on the side of corporate, I don’t see why they would lie if they did get a false detection.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Because in this particular case, it would look bad on their system if players knew that it does false positive players as bots. That would cause a huge influx of people asking “jegex unban me pls, I didn’t bot” - and also “jegex reset the xp you rolled me back”.<br>
The other cases when it threw a false positive, it was on a much larger scale so Jagex was more than willing to take the blame, because it was <span class="bbcode-i">too obvious</span> and if they didn’t fix it, they’d have lost their players. (Example being when they enabled bot watch and it massed banned thousands)[/quote]That’s my theory. I think the issue really is just that I created such a massive influx of interest in the thread that they decided to go with the instinct that led me to suffer the consequence of their system flagging me wrong. I could have probably gotten unbanned had I appealed in a more quiet manner. Oh well.</p>
<p>At least my other alt that I use to do MLM mining isn’t banned.</p>

              <p>They have never said their detection is 100% correct. They agree that they do have human reviewers that can have human incorrectness. With that in mind, they have undone bans before. It’s not like Valve with their VAC system.<br>
I do agree that, even Z said this on his few posts, that if they unbanned him more people would flood saying that they were false detection. He also had two JMods reply, with one saying there would be a review.<br>
I don’t know the JMods anymore, haven’t played the game since '09, so I don’t know who Mat K is or the person that said there will be a review.</p>

<p>The system they have right now is very good compared to what they had years ago, but Jagex saying there can be no false bans is just moronic.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have no doubts that the system very well could of given a false positive for botting, but I also don’t doubt the fact that there was actually botting done on the account.</p>
