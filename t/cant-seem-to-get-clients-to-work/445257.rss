    <title>Can&#39;t seem to get Clients to work</title>

    <description>Hey guys,

I seem to be unable to get any clients to compile right. Trying to compile with the various scripts included never works, with the error:
[code]
javac: file not found: src\*.java
Usage: javac &lt;options&gt; &lt;source files&gt;
use -help for a list of possible options[/code]
The script is:
[code]@echo off
cd C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_05\bin
javac -cp lib/clientlibs.jar; -deprecation -d bin -sourcepath src src/*.java
pause
[/code] - I am on Windows 7.

If I import a client into Eclipse, there are no errors but quite a few warnings. I&#39;ve only tried this with one client though and I&#39;m not sure what revision it is, sorry.

Also, the moparscape pre-compiled client doesn&#39;t work. The web based one just sits on Java loading bar forever, and the client one crashes before the game can fully load. As far as I know all my java is installed correctly...

EDIT: I know there is a sticky for compiler errors but I think my error is outside of the compiler, as the Moparscape ones don&#39;t work either.</description>
