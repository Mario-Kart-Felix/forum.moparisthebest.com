    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-adding-different-appearances/408166</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;v been working on my server, and i noticed that in the change appearance interface it has hardly any of the appearances :\ I was wondering if someone knows how to add some? so then maybe i can rip them from another Source?
