    <title>Server Unable to Connect to, when port 43594 is open (Even with localhost client</title>

    <description>Hey guys, i believe the owner of this source Has made it unable to get the server online.


So it works fine when i have my port 43594 offline  and playing server on localhost with a client that connects to 127.0.0.1

But from the moment i put port 43594 online, the server is unable to connect to, even with a client that connects to localhost
A kinda anti-leech.

Then a guy told me to fix this i had to look for &quot;43594&quot; and &quot;Localhost&quot;

So i did, the only 43594 was the serverlisenport in server.java , And Localhost was only found in client.java client sided, 
but i believe this anti-leech sort of thing is server sided, so i realy didn&#39;t found anything to work with.


Anyone can help me out with this?

i&#39;ll repp and even give a rspg reward.</description>
