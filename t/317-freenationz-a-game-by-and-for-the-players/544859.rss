    <description>[center][u][i][b]FREENATIONZ[/b][/i][/u][/center]
Revision: 317/474 
Type: Economy/pvm with a different aspect of pvp

Current stage: Alpha 
Next Stage: Beta (Next week)


Hello guys, I would like to start by saying why I am making this. If any of you are like me, and hopefully you are so this can succeed then you want a server that actually needs work and some dedication to level up, gain items, and become good. Most servers now focus on pvp. This is fun for the first few days, but I get bored of it and usually never log in to that server again (bad servers will not be named) I want to bring back what I enjoyed about servers and a big inspiration for me is Dodian. I loved the hard work me and my friends needed to put into getting our items, leveling up it got me hooked for months. This isn&#39;t a Dodian remake, its a server inspired by Dodian.

[b]CONTENT[i][u][/u][/i][/b]

Beginner Monsters:
Rats (Drop Iron and Mithril)
Chicken (Drop feathers which you would need to make your arrows)
Cows (for hides)


[b]Intermediete monsters:[/b]
Moss giants (drop Adamant and are good to train once you reach lvl 30 - 40) 
Soldiers (drop Mithril and are good to train once you reach level 30)
Hill Giants (drop big bones which is kind of obvious)
black knights (drop black armor)

[b]Expert Monsters:[/b]
Lesser demons (Drop Rune chainbody and platelegs and some quest items)
Heros (Drop Rune Platebody, Full helm, and scimmy)
Dragons (Drop hide which you&#39;d need for crafting and bones/ they are extremely hard to kill)

I will be adding more monsters, but this is what we have for now.

Skills:
All skills are 100% done

The pvp aspect:

This I would like to explain. There is no wilderness, instead you can choose to duel someone and put a stake. You can duel anywhere, it doesn&#39;t need to be in the duel arena. I will be adding a pvp mini game though.

[u][i][b]How are staff going to be chosen?[/b][/i][/u]

I would like you guys to choose the staff. I don&#39;t want to have any part in choosing any staff except for the co - owner since I am not the only one developing this. How will you guys choose the staff? Keep reading below  :)

Requirements to be a mod (The requirements to be a Admin are very similar):

- You cannot have anything against you (Past bans, mutes, etc..)
- You need to be a player for at least a month. You may then post an application on the website. 
- You need at least 3 player supporters and each should be playing for at least 2 weeks 
- Then the community as a whole will vote if Yes exceed no then your in.

<p>That was weird when I first posted it the font was fine on my screen. Well its fixed now guys. Thanks for letting me know</p>
<p>[quote=“Elrick, post:4, topic:544859”]Monsters you’ve mentioned are highly generic. Obviously some of the resource based ones (Chicken for feathers, cows for leather, etc.) are necessary, but they shouldn’t be training exercises. find the best, unique models in the 317/474 and edit them to become beginner, intermediate, and expert training monsters. You do not need to just take the generic monsters and place them in just because everyone does that.</p>
<p>Also, yeah please decrease the font size to like 12 max, and bold is unnecessary.[/quote]</p>
<p>I thought so too about it being too generic but I didn’t know how people would respond to putting in unique monsters. Thanks for your reply man I’ll get working on it and ill update the thread soon please check back soon to see updates. Thanks</p>
