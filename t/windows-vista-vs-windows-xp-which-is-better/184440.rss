    <title>Windows Vista vs Windows XP! Which is better?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/windows-vista-vs-windows-xp-which-is-better/184440</link>
    <description>I just got a 320 GB Hard Drive with 3GB memory, and dual core processors. The only problem is, it comes with Windows Vista. I&#39;ve heard alot of bad things about Vista, but could someone narrow it down for me. What makes XP better than Vista? And the only reason I don&#39;t just install XP on to the new computer is that if I do, they said that my computer will run 20% slower than what it did with Vista...

HELP!</description>

              <p>I would go for XP, thing is that would most likely void the warranty, least it did with my friends pc, I don’t know the numbers, but from what I have seen vista is slower, and gets slower the older it gets.</p>
