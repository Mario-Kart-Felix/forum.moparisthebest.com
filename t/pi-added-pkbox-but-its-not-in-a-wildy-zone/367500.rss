    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-added-pkbox-but-its-not-in-a-wildy-zone/367500</link>
    <description>ok so i added a pkbox to my source and idk how to make it in wildy i know you have to go in player.java and set some coords under the inmulti boolean but idk likw what coords to put.
i have a place and the picture for were i want my pkbox and i have the coords for the four corners can somebody tell me how the coords would look in player.java?

[code]here are the coords of the 4 corners
1.x 2916 y 9713
2.x 2916 y 9699
3.x 2898 y 9699
4.x 2898 y 9713[/code]

              <p>The tables may be Client side,<br>
But for the Wild problem try and make a boolean “isinPKbox” and set coords like you would for the wild or something.</p>
