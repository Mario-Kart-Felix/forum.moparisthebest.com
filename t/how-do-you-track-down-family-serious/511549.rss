    <title>How do you track down family.... [Serious]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-track-down-family-serious/511549</link>
    <description>Well. My last name, let alone my first name, is very popular.
I never met my dad. I only know his first name is Mike (I can get the last name from my mom). But I want to know, how do you track family down.
I&#39;m 17, so I don&#39;t think any &#39;database&#39; will have my in it.
But yeah, my name is Jesse Watson (some know it via skype.)
And my dad&#39;s last name starts with an S. So that doesn&#39;t really. Yeah.

What do I do here.</description>

It’s going to take a long time, and a lot of patience. It would be smart to head to his home town like someone else mentioned. Ask for pictures previous addresses etc. You will eventually have multiple pictures that you’ll have to choose which one looks more like you etc. You’ll find him if ya just look :3 gl<br>

Are you seriously that loveing ignorant? How hard would it be to pay $2 to find out where he could possibly be on site which gives reports? You know that would include his birth state and town. Quit being a penisy love.</p>

              <p>Well. My last name, let alone my first name, is very popular.<br>
I never met my dad. I only know his first name is Mike (I can get the last name from my mom). But I want to know, how do you track family down.<br>
I’m 17, so I don’t think any ‘database’ will have my in it.<br>
But yeah, my name is Jesse Watson (some know it via skype.)<br>
And my dad’s last name starts with an S. So that doesn’t really. Yeah.</p>
<p>What do I do here.</p>
