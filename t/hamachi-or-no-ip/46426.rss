    <title>Hamachi or no-ip?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hamachi-or-no-ip/46426</link>
    <description>well since we are not allowed to say wether our server is no-ip or hamachi now, it gets frusturating having to go on all the wrong topics, just to find out they are hamachi which i have no clue how to use. we should be able to put something in it to indicate wether its hamachi or  no-ip, maybe [ham] or [no-ip] now how in the world is that spam? wow its indicating wther its no-ip or ham its such spam because it lets ppl know what kind of server it is -_-... :eek:i dunno about anyone else or any of mods, but we should be able to know before we click, tecniquially its spam to have to go to topics you dont want =\</description>

              <p>although i fully agree with shamcooly, teh mods decided it was “spam” and “looked not neat”</p>
<p>really its just “annoying” and “confusing” and “makes you feel stupid when you click on a ham post, and you dont have ham so you have to sift threads to find one”</p>
<p>But you gotta listen to teh mods -.-</p>
