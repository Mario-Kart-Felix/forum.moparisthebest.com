    <description>Hey guys, 
I have been looking for some RSPS, and I was wondering if anyone could help me with

[b]a) How do I get it out so that some of my friends can join?
b) I have a i7 Processor is that fast enough to host 562+?
c) Can anyone host if they want? I can pay..[/b]

I have hosted 2 RSPS&#39;s before but I never put them online ( Like 2years ago ) 
All I really do now is code websites and stuff, so if anyone can help, just PLEASE MSG me at: packunchained@hotmail.com


Thanks
