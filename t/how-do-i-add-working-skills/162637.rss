    <title>How do I add working skills?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-add-working-skills/162637</link>
    <description>Ok im asking just for a basic over view of adding woodcutting and stuff, how to edit xp given and the messages given inbetween leveling.
Also how to add something where say you click the tree at a particular level you get a certain object. Ofcourse this must apply to all skills, so thankyou for your help guys I would appreciate a tutorial because there are no decent skill making tutorials that I&#39;ve found unless you can give me a good link.

Anyway thankyou.
