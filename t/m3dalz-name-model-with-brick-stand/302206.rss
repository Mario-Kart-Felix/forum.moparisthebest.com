    <title>M3dalz Name Model with Brick Stand</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/m3dalz-name-model-with-brick-stand/302206</link>
    <description>This is my S/N I use on brick stands which are created by me for WC3 as the base for a firepit in a survival. The bricks weren&#39;t meant to be very high detail but I did anyways as a test. This is already animated so I just took the joints out so you could see. This whole model was going to be used maybe as our Dev. Team Names. Each member as going to have their own name on different ones. Pretty cool though. I was too lazy to hand create the Names so I just used the 3d text option but the bricks were a pain in the ass in animation as you had vertice&#39;s going everywhere until I finally found out I forgot to make them all linear bases XD This was made using MilkShape 3d.

<p>He did nothing wrong. He made it for himself, this is the models section. Nowhere in the description does it say “Every thread has to be a release”.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think it looks nice.</p>
