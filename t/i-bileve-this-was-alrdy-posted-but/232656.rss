    <description>could some1 make a low level f2p pking server ( this idea was inspired by my mapu &lt;3)

the max combat would be like around 40 ish maybe 64 if u want r2h pures

when you spawn you pick which low level you would like to be ( in example 20 mith 2h pure ) items would be decently hard to obtain but not 2 hard 

lobs+str pots would be in bank

imo low level pking owned but thats just my opinion ( and please if some1 does bother  2 use this idea that was inspired by mapu please dont do it on a shitty ass divine pk source rscd ftw :)</description>
