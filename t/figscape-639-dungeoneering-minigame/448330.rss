    <title>FiGScape [639] Dungeoneering Minigame</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/figscape-639-dungeoneering-minigame/448330</link>
    <description>Hello everyone! My names Justin, and I am creating a RSPS by the name of FiGScape. I use to have one that was a 317 and recently upgraded to 639. It&#39;s a bit of a change haha. But anyways today I would like to show everyone a minigame I have been working on and get some feedback on what everyone thinks about it!
Heres a video of it!
[youtube]www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrwyv5X74J0[/youtube]
I have been trying to decide on what to do about the dungeoneering skill lately, as I want the dungeoneering armors to be valuable. There are several ways, one way could&#39;ve been like most other servers, donate to get the best gear. But I decided on a very challenging minigame which will require players to work together and formulate strategies to take down some tough bosses!
You kill monsters and work your way through waves or &quot;rooms&quot;. Each monster drops a certain amount of ancient tokens. You collect these until you save up enough to buy a chaotic from a store! (2 Million tokens)
If you want any other type of dungeoneering gear (Primal/Promethium/Novite) you have to kill the NPC&#39;s. These armors are an EXTREMELY RARE drop (.5 chance of drop).
PS: The monsters also drop mage and range gear not just melee!
This is the [LOW] Level minigame. Medium and High level are much more challenging. Videos of them will be released later.
~~~~~~~~
Difficulties : 
[LOW] Lvl 1-75
[MEDIUM] Lvl 75-99
[HIGH] Lvl 99-120
Recommended to be combat level 120+ before attempting this.
Teams of 4+ are recommended (As you saw I barely solo&#39;d this in the video with the MAXIMUM gear in my server, which was +900 melee defense bonus and hitting 600+ with my rapier!)
In the LOW level difficulty there are only 5 rooms!
In each room you kill the highest leveled NPC for the latest key, which will be used on the chest in the room, which will transport you to the next room. Killing low leveled monsters in the room will give you keys for previous rooms, which can be used to skip certain floords (Example: Stocking up on Room 4 Keys, so you can skip straight to the boss next time)
Keys are uncommon.
Depending on the level decides how rare the key is.
Lvl 7: 7% Chance of Drop
Lvl 74: 10% Chance of Drop
Brute: 12% Chance of Drop
Necromancer: 15% Chance of Drop
(Everything past necromancer = 20% Chance of Drop for key)
Each room gets progressively tougher. As you will notice in rooms 1-3 it is easy, you pray melee and you&#39;re fine. Room 4, it changes up where there is multiple styles of combat and you have to use the combat triangle! (Pray mage to negate magic, and high melee defense to protect yourself from melee NPC&#39;s) Then in Room 5 AKA the &quot;Boss Room&quot; there is a large amount of NPC&#39;s so no matter what you pray and what you&#39;re geared up in, it is a tough challenge! The boss is the highest leveled NPC in the room, which in this case was the Necrolord. The boss&#39;s normally have decent drops whether you get a rare or not.

*Also, I didn&#39;t pick up any tokens during this video as it was just a bit of a quick run through lol. But on average you can get 30k-50k tokens from completing the entire low level difficulty.
**I know that it seems like with such a low amount of tokens it would take forever to get the chaotics, but it really doesn&#39;t take that long. I have plans for the High level floors where you&#39;ll be making very large amounts of tokens!

~~
To keep myself organized I plan alot of this out using sort of an outline style to help me remember and stay on track of this!
