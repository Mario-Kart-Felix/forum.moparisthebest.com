    <title>Consensus on RS2 Cheating</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/consensus-on-rs2-cheating/165464</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been thinking of updating my few thousand lines of code into a workable bot from the heap of alerts it currently gives... What I&#39;m wondering though, is now that all the pleasure of massive loot from an epic PKER is gone, coincided with the fact that there&#39;s absolutely no profitability, is there any reason for us to even continue with the game? 

I mean, should we hack a game that no one really plays now that they&#39;ve taken two or more(pking, dueling, rares) major aspects of the game, making it into an almost pointless endeavor for legitimate players, let alone cheaters....?

I&#39;ve given it quite a bit of thought, and I think I&#39;ll update it one last time, just to show jagex that they&#39;re fools for ruining their flagship enterprise... But it&#39;d be nice to hear other peoples thoughts for or against.</description>

<p>I looked it up for you!!</p>
<p>Babe is a little pig who doesn’t quite know his place in the world. With a bunch of odd friends, like Ferdinand the duck who thinks he is a rooster and Fly the dog he calls mom, Babe realizes that he has the makings to become the greatest sheep pig of all time, and Farmer Hogget Knows it. With the help of the sheep dogs Babe learns that a pig can be anything that he wants to be.</p>
<p>You better love me.</p>

After reviewing your previous posts all over this forum, I have to say, this is the most mature/intelligent post you have made to date.</p>

so as long as i do it, and 7 or 8 others, its fine.</p>
<p>if you really got ants in your pants, and want to make money from it, how about training accounts up to 85 mining, then selling them. Trade in skills instead of cash</p>

<p>Lets assume we have the same “market penetration” as Aryan. (ie. 5% of all RS players) Would it matter? Assuming that we have a prefect bot that can evade every random and pissed off mod, would we destroy the concept of skilling? Would that matter?</p>

              <p>I’ve been thinking of updating my few thousand lines of code into a workable bot from the heap of alerts it currently gives… What I’m wondering though, is now that all the pleasure of massive loot from an epic PKER is gone, coincided with the fact that there’s absolutely no profitability, is there any reason for us to even continue with the game?</p>
<p>I mean, should we hack a game that no one really plays now that they’ve taken two or more(pking, dueling, rares) major aspects of the game, making it into an almost pointless endeavor for legitimate players, let alone cheaters…?</p>
<p>I’ve given it quite a bit of thought, and I think I’ll update it one last time, just to show jagex that they’re fools for ruining their flagship enterprise… But it’d be nice to hear other peoples thoughts for or against.</p>
