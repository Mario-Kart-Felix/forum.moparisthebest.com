    <title>Connecting to Jagex&#39;s servers with a downloaded client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connecting-to-jagexs-servers-with-a-downloaded-client/116504</link>
    <description>Well - the web client provided by runescape.com is very laggy for me, what Jagex USED to have (back in the day) was a downloadable client to play runescape with - I&#39;m not talking about the runescape.exe you can download from their downloads page - you actually downloaded all the java files and stuff. Well they don&#39;t offer that anymore because of client hacking, etc. But I was wondering if there was a way I could download the game, and connect to the main servers. I mean - you wouldn&#39;t be changing anything other than the fact your running the applet off your machine, so it seems like it would work fine. This would eliminate some lagg for me. 

Plausible?</description>

Yes, they did - you can google cache it if you want, but thats not the point.<br>
I just want to know if it would be a simple task.<br>

<p>It was offered when it first came out, you can use the waybackmachine at <a href="http://archive.org" rel="nofollow noopener">archive.org</a> to see it. AGAIN - this isnt the point.</p>
