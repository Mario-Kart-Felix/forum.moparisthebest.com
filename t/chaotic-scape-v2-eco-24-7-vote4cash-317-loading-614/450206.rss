[B]Why play C-S?[/B]
Chaotic-Scape is unlike any server.
Its &quot;player friendly&quot;, meaning we respect our players.
We don&#39;t need donations to run.
We don&#39;t let our donators get everything, so we have everything to the people.
This server isn&#39;t power to the owner.
It&#39;s power to the players.
Everyone has a voice in this server.
Voice your opinion.
Everyone has a voice, learn to use it.

[B]Chaotic-Scapes saying[/B]: [B][I][U]Power[/U][/I][/B] to the players


[B]Updates:[/B]

<p>By the way, your Co-Owner’s post makes me not want to play. I just read through your updates, and ummm… Mostly just small bug fixes and what-not. There’s really nothing major or redone from what I saw, correct me if I’m wrong though. What base is this by the way? Soulsplit?</p>

</aside>
<p>Yea… Co-Owner… The topic about the funny pictures? Asked him why it was there…</p>
<p>And no not soulsplit. Sadly its insidiaxv2… Most of the server features were already in there… Not a leech just wanted a challenge I hear insidiaX is very hard to get stable and fix so I wanted to step up and do it. But I will be revamping most of it… Whenever I get less distracted… Two laptops really make its hard to stay on one topic… But thanks for actually taking notice in the server.<br>

<p>Thank you for being honest about the features. I started our Devolution 7.0 source, because I was looking to have fun instead of a challenge. We’re having a ton of fun working on it so far. You’re welcome, just stay motivated, and try to make original content and write as much as you can by yourself.[/quote]</p>
<p>I will don’t worry :).</p>
<p>Also BUMP! Updates for 7/18/2012 have been posted!</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Why play C-S?</span><br>
Chaotic-Scape is unlike any server.<br>
Its “player friendly”, meaning we respect our players.<br>
We don’t need donations to run.<br>
We don’t let our donators get everything, so we have everything to the people.<br>
This server isn’t power to the owner.<br>
It’s power to the players.<br>
Everyone has a voice in this server.<br>
Voice your opinion.<br>
Everyone has a voice, learn to use it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chaotic-Scapes saying</span>: <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">Power</span></span></span> to the players</p>
