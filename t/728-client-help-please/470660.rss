    <description>I&#39;m trying to make a sever for me and my friends to mess around on, and I made a signed jar and everything, and when I send it to my friends they get stuck at the &quot;Waiting for updates - 1%&quot; which means it&#39;s not connecting to my server. If anyone knows how I can make it work for us, please lemme know asap.</description>
