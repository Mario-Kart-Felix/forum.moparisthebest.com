    <title>Need Help Remembering a Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-remembering-a-server/382693</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I know I just registered, but I need help. I don&#39;t know if this is in the right section so... I remember playing on a server and it was runescape 2 or something, I&#39;m not so sure and the hometown was Camolot, it wasn&#39;t really a pk server and they had their own site where you can buy to be a donator for 1 month, and as a donator you can spawn stuff. It&#39;s been 3 years since I played it and all I can remember is the number 37 and 52 as the server ip, it would be great if anyone can help me or tell me what happened to that server. :)</description>

<p>Fucking shit server anyway :)[/quote]</p>
<p>I remembered buying from that site but when I asked one of the members if Camelot was once a hometown, they said no. I think there was a server ip and the only way of joining the game was through moparscape.</p>
