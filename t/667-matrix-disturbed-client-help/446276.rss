    <description>Hi,

My main problem is that i can&#39;t get my Jared/Signed webclient to connect to my source.I&#39;ve changed everything in Loader.java,Client.java,gamestub.java to my Vps Ip.I&#39;ve also followed &#39;&#39;Shabba 56&#39;&#39; Jaring tutorial carefully and accuratley but my client cannot connect to my source.I&#39;ve jared it over 5 times now but it seems to not connect (by what i mean is that the client is saying &quot;connecting to server 1%&quot;).

(Most of all i compiled the client over 5 times and the compiler of the client does work.)

Please Help Me ASAP.

Thank-You</description>
