    <description>Well, it is obvious that the contests are lacking in activity. Is it because the contests require to complex of a model? Vote and leave your thoughts below. We will take them into consideration. This poll will close a week after the post date.</description>

              <p>as i believe there are alot of talented modellers on this forum and yet the model contests consist quite strict requirements and the only people that enter them are people that are well known modellers, they think meh i dont have a chance why bother?..</p>
<p>Dylan, you are a perfect example of what extremely talented modellers can do when they put there time into it, i think if you along with the other good modellers come togeather as a group instead of leaving this up to one person, share your tips, ideas, and stratagies in a post with the new modellers that dont have alot of experience, i could see the modelling contests picking up as people learn. Remember this is a community, if we share we can grow <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Oh yes, as I don’t think you will like the next contest, I will tell you that originally the contest was going to be model a Human Character. Us judges, however, are kind of thinking that nobody will enter should this be the case.<br>

<p>There is a poly limit given for each contest. If you read through the rules, you would be aware of this.</p>
<p>Also, in general, your feedback has helped. I can assure you the next contest will be different. For one, it wont be a character model ha ha.<br>
On another note: us judges will post a topic for our inspirational character model as we have worked fairly hard to bring good inspiration for that contest.</p>

<p>Possible solution(s): I think changing the little things can make a big difference.

It needs to be just a simple post that has a download link for meta and datmaker, and basically just says that it’s easy to start, and that everyone should try. Make a sticky topic titled " Uploading models and pictures is easy! Find out here!", or something of the sort. It would just be a small little posts saying how to upload a picture, and post it in the contest. Have the contest post have " Anyone can enter!", or “open to the public!”. Maybe “Everyone try! :P!”.</span>[/quote]<br>
Last part I stroked through because SilentCJ already made a topic on how to use Metaseq. I also made bold with what I agree with you. You judges should make a simply tutorial with a video on how to model say armor, or how to utilize color shading to your best abilities. I myself suck at using materials and shading them. RS does it masterfully.</p>

              <p>I’ve mostly been busy with stuff and I can never model any human-like thing (including armor and such). The main reason I wouldn’t enter the armor contest because every time I tried, my model looked like shit, which I didn’t want to enter considering the effort I had put into the spear (which wasn’t all too much, I just wanted to enter in it).</p>
<p>Besides, I don’t think I’ve made a model since then. Iirc, I would make models much more often during the earlier parts of this year, but I have gotten XBox since, school started, got homework, etc etc. I haven’t had the time to model recently and because of that, I am beginning to get rather rusty. I’d love to try and enter the next contest when activity spikes up, but don’t expect anything great out of me.</p>

              <p>I would like to see a model contest about something less complex, and runescape-like as moparscape which indulge’s runescape. A human person is too hard for most of the people including myself, to make. Maybe if you made a model contest about sword’s battleaxe’s mace’s ect. more people would join. On the contrary you will have more models that arent evan worth looking at. It’s quite a problem.</p>

              <p>Dylan, I would love to actually enter a good model for a contest but i just dont have the time, school is gearing toward finals right now and i (and probably some others as well) don’t have the time to make decent models.<br>
and i’m trying to model scenes and not so much items, (although i have been working on rigging/animating and characters)</p>
<p>and also, most of the active users on here are modeling in meta and have limited tools.<br>
and also you cant have some treacherous modeling contest because remember about low skill people wanting to enter (which i i think is dumb how they complain, when it’s a contest, obviously your stacked against. and better people will enter because they have a decent shot… but whatever) ha</p>
