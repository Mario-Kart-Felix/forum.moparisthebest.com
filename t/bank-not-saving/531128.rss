    <title>Bank not saving?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bank-not-saving/531128</link>
    <description>So i&#39;m using Epicurus as a base for the server I am working on and I&#39;m wandering why every time I log-in my bank is empty. I searched through the PlayerSave file and it does have a procedure to save the bank items to the character file, but yet it doesn&#39;t? Anyone else have this problem with this source?</description>
