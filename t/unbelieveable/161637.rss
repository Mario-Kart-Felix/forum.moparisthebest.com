    <description>This is unreal.
Starts as a normal school day, next thing you know.
They talk to me about someone getting stabbed. Here&#39;s how it went.


Principle:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mike, someone said you have stabbed them in the arm. Is this true?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Me:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No..&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Princible:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Well the nurse[Crybabylul] said she pulled out Graphite from his arm, from a pencil stab&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Me:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Well I don&#39;t care what she found, it doesn&#39;t mean I did it?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Princible:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Well there was a point found in his arm, so someone did, and you said you poked him&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The pencil I poked him with, was no sharp, no point [AT ALL] and I poked him on his hand.

So today [Friday], the police called, saying what happend.

So they&#39;re making me do community service or pay a 600$ fine.

I think it&#39;s unfair because the other had no witnesses...
Eh?

<p>I was once a scapegoat in my junior high school years and got left back for this bullshit too.</p>
<p>It was a regular day than all of a sudden the teachers purse goes missing, i’m just as I remember copying notes… Than all of a sudden the teacher says AHHHHHHHHHHHH than starts yelling. Most of my classmates are all black… no white pplz here im the only white here. Teacher asks they class did anyone see my purse and everyone says OH oh he took it. At first it started with 2 people than the whole class was against me. I couldn’t handle it and started laughing uncontrollably teacher being black also comes up all in my face and tells me to give her purse back. I say what purse rofl and she calls the DEAN on me which just calls my parents etc… nothing bad. At the end of the year next thing I know my report card says</p>
<p>NR NR NR NR on all subjects like wTF? I been absent maybe 4 days max rofl and I did all my tests with a 70+ in all subjects.</p>
<p>I know I should of sued for discrimination but I was dumb so i let it slide.</p>

there parents are quire bags.<br>
ass fuck them.</p>
<p>this is the most gayiest thing i eveeer seen. You stabbed a kid with a pencil with no top, he stabs him self to blame <span class="bbcode-b"> you </span> and fake cries and makes you end up in the principal office? Thats bullshit, my school system fails to, i got ‘introuble’ by fucking getting beat up by a mexican.</p>
<p>This just shows how the school system sucks and parents are fags and fire law suits about poking kids with pencils.</p>
