    <title>A very screwed up compile problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-very-screwed-up-compile-problem/240891</link>
    <description>K so me and my friend were updating his server over the internet, and he sent me his 3 files I needed. I updated them, and then put them on my server to see if there were any errors on compiler. I got this:

client(1).java:7: class client is public, should be declared in a file named cli
ent.java
public class client extends Player implements Runnable {
       ^
NPCHandler(1).java:4: class NPCHandler is public, should be declared in a file n
amed NPCHandler.java
public class NPCHandler {
       ^
Note: stream.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.
2 errors
Files Compiled Successfully!
Press any key to continue . . .

Yet I have public class client extends Player implements Runnable { on both of them!

Now, I delete public off
public class client extends Player implements Runnable {

so it has class client extends Player implements Runnable {

Compiler worked, 1 left. I did the exact same for NPC Handler, and compiler worked. I ran my test server, and it said autospawn.cfg: file could not be found.

How do I fix this??!?! Please help =(</description>
