    <description>I have 2 problems I need fixed right away.

1. When I click on the attack symbol in the top-left where you view your weapon things, you have to click in the bottom-right of the image for it to show your combat stuff. This also happens when I click on certain sprites, I have to click on the right side of them to be able to view the interface.

2. When I go to the prayer section, the prayer icon in the little black box has grey around it, just like in the skills section. How do I fix this?</description>
