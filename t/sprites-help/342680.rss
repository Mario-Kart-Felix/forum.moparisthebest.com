    <description>Hi, there could somebody please explain to me how the rsc sprites are put together / rendered,
Im no java coder, and im not learning java either, im making a basic rsc game in another programming language,
and i&#39;ve learnt that you cant just &#39;center&#39; a helmet on top of a body ect, i&#39;ve tried my own methods and failed.
I&#39;ve done my research via searching forums, google, and i&#39;ve read through a few java files, and learnt that they
are somehow constructed from the sprite files width, height ect, but then again, Im hopeless with java.

Im so close to getting this complete, i&#39;ve built my own map, and even run-time sprite recolourer.

Basicly I have a blank picturebox, and I want to place 5 sprites into it, Helmet, Plate, Legs, Longsword and a Shield (in the correct positions)
are they all constructed from a center point or a bounding box ect..

Thankyou.</description>
