    <description>mk so for my jad minigame you to have to solo it. Basicly there is a new copy of the level in the map every 4 spaces high you are (like godwars). I want it to be so that if a player is in 1 level, it teles you to the next level. can someone help with that. im thinking of pretty much copying like an area method, and using that as a condition, but i&#39;ll have to add like 40 methods... i want something smaller and neater.</description>
