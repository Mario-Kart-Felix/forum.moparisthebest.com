I know this may not seem like something you would put your time and effort into but realize this you miss 100% of the shots you dont take, so i urge the talented to please join me and to make this a standard for all RSPS&#39;S.

Sorry if i haven&#39;t met some peoples standards for a development team post, but im trying to build something from nothing and wish you can help.[/code]</description>
