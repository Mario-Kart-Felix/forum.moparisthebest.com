Please, send me a quick quote of one of my previous comments where I stated this wouldn’t be worth the time. It had a good player base and people obviously miss it being gone, so it should be re-created. I was telling OP that he shouldn’t expect other people to re-create it so he can be the savior of ToonTown.<br>

<p>as there was no obvious sign of who you were directing this towards, it’s only safe to guess that “[you] re-create a game that would be more appreciated by people.” was heavily towards that of the OP. as he is the one wanting to create it. (clearly we can tell he doesn’t have the capability – but those are his means.)</p>
<p>that being said, it is implied that you are saying toontown is not going to be appreciated by anyone, or less appreciated than by another [unreal '97] game.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@also</span> - the game is already being developed [see above]<br>
<span class="mention">@OP</span> - perhaps you may have some content that toontownrewritten doesn’t have - maybe try contacting the developers.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, I insinuated less appreciation of one game of the other, however, I didn’t state that it <span class="bbcode-i">wouldn’t </span>be appreciated.</p>
