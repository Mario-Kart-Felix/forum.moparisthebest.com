    <description>is anyone here home schooled? because i am and i hate it! i like my old school and wish i could go back but my parents wont let me. i had to switch because i did poorly the first semester, but then i got like strait A&#39;s and they still wouldnt let me stay! so i have to do it for my sophomore year and i get really distracted by moparscape and moparisthebest because this is so much more fun that school. i still get my work done but it just takes longer. Im in an online school thing, not even the traditional home schooling by mom or w/e. its online and it blows. i told my teachers and they are like, its your first year and you arent even a month in. and i told them that i dont care because i miss my friends and sports.
so if your home schooled or have been home schooled, what are your thoughts about it?</description>

<p>lol. i still hang out with friends, but i cant as much. and i agree, home schooled people end up socially retarded, thats why only my parents think this is a good idea and stuff. every one else i have talked to says that its dumb and you probably will have social issues later in life, lol. and thats not good cuz im already really shy!</p>

<p>Plus if your homeschooled, there is less chance of you being employed by someone who cares about who works for them.</p>
