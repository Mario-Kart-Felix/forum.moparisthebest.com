    <description>Desperation for the win.

Anyway, I will do coding for reasonably cheap =), PayPal.
Please don&#39;t ask me to make a new bot for the new RuneScape engine.

I am willing to code projects very seriously, if interested drop a line to regecks@tpg.com.au

If this blatant advertising is not allowed, feel free to delete =).</description>

<p>Yes the one who owns Elitescape.</p>
<p>He offered me hosting when I was in proccess of making my crap RoBot. I took him up and made some forums. I only did this because I thought I could update. When really, I accidentially copied ruler’s output instead of the one out of my aryan updater. Thus, a working bot. Neonknight persuaded me into letting him join the team. He kept bugging me to update, but I was too busy. When I tried to one day, I failed, discombobulated. He claimed I stole their output, and refused to accept my sorrow and story. He then fabricated some convo with some other guy saying that me and Slayer (I guess you would call him another dev) were begging him to get us Ruler’s output. He posted all that crap on the front page of Gimpsoft. I got mad. Then I figured, if I accidentially updated my bot with their output, couldn’t I update their crap pay bot with anyone elses output? So I opened my old folder of IMP Aryan and Nerice’s newest Aryan. Updated the methods in IMP’s bot and plugged in Nerice’s output. I disabled most of Gimpsoft’s protection. I didn’t even think about Nerice having a trigger for all the traps. Hey, working IMP Aryan, that’s all I cared about. So without testing, I posted this on my forums. When Nerice told me about his stuff, my sides changed. Instead of helping all the noobs and giving them free IMPAryan, I was using that against them. They’d use a trapped up IMP Aryan, and most likely get banned. Then Ruler said he was DDOSing Elitescape for having Nerice’s Output and their files on his server. I told him that it was my stuff and said I’d take it off if he wanted, and explained what happened. He said nah that they doubted him and he would still continue attacking anyways. Their site got owned and they had to get new hosting I think.</p>

<p>Yes the one who owns Elitescape.</p>
<p>He offered me hosting when I was in proccess of making my crap RoBot. I took him up and made some forums. I only did this because I thought I could update. When really, I accidentially copied ruler’s output instead of the one out of my aryan updater. Thus, a working bot. Neonknight persuaded me into letting him join the team. He kept bugging me to update, but I was too busy. When I tried to one day, I failed, discombobulated. He claimed I stole their output, and refused to accept my sorrow and story. He then fabricated some convo with some other guy saying that me and Slayer (I guess you would call him another dev) were begging him to get us Ruler’s output. He posted all that crap on the front page of Gimpsoft. I got mad. Then I figured, if I accidentially updated my bot with their output, couldn’t I update their crap pay bot with anyone elses output? So I opened my old folder of IMP Aryan and Nerice’s newest Aryan. Updated the methods in IMP’s bot and plugged in Nerice’s output. I disabled most of Gimpsoft’s protection. I didn’t even think about Nerice having a trigger for all the traps. Hey, working IMP Aryan, that’s all I cared about. So without testing, I posted this on my forums. When Nerice told me about his stuff, my sides changed. Instead of helping all the noobs and giving them free IMPAryan, I was using that against them. They’d use a trapped up IMP Aryan, and most likely get banned. Then Ruler said he was DDOSing Elitescape for having Nerice’s Output and their files on his server. I told him that it was my stuff and said I’d take it off if he wanted, and explained what happened. He said nah that they doubted him and he would still continue attacking anyways. Their site got owned and they had to get new hosting I think.</p>

Thanks for being truthful.  also to know who mr x is use the search function on this post.  If you hate mr x, then you probably hate jews also or you support ripping and scamming.</p>
<p>on a sidenote, RegeX does know java and he can definently lead a team to design good systems, look at shell bot.</p>

Nerice, when you say smacker has something coming, please don’t attack him.</p>
<p>Smacker does not host fagex anymore, firefag got a new host. All that smacker hosts right now is azn-hosting and whoever is with us on that.

<p>or like when we “crashed the sever” and you lost all data? lol. honestly you guys dont know what nerice did. he was only only one to crack the sbot3 authorization that im sure alot of you used. hes the only one who updated aryan every single time. hes the only one who was looking at byutecode modification in the loader before the engine update. shos some respect and you all wodner why you end up with sour bot makers who only will realse the programs if they get money.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well smacker lied to me on that one, but in either case he sent in money to webhostplus and I have no idea why.</p>
<p>How is asking Nerice not to attack the server that my site is hosted on being dis-respectful? I don’t even have a clue what your talking about, that was pretty random.</p>
