    <title>Having trouble adding Galkons dual gs&#39;s, help please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/having-trouble-adding-galkons-dual-gss-help-please/236641</link>
    <description>Ok, I added the ints, and I&#39;m pretty sure I did that correctly. I also added the drop/invy model and the wielded model into my models folder in my client. But when I spawn it, it just shows up as a null. Like, it says their name, and the examine info is correct, but I cant wield them, and its a picture of the rag and bones man bag lol.

Now, i know you have to type in some add model thing, but I&#39;m not sure how to do that. Either way, when I put the models into my model folder, I just put them in as 99999.dat and 99998.dat. Do I need to name them something special? Ugh, idk. Help please. =]</description>
