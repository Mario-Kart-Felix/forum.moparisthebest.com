    <title>Multiple pick up fix?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/multiple-pick-up-fix/384267</link>
    <description>Hey I am editing a 317 and when I go to picking up something off of the ground, I get as many of the item as however many times I clicked. Example: If I quickly clicked a single Dragon longsword that was on the floor 5 times, 5 would appear in my inventory. How can I stop this and make it so I only get one no matter how many times I click it? Thanks :)</description>
