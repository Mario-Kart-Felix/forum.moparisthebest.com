    <description>Hey guys

So recently i thought,hm,i need to improve my server
So here&#39;s what i need,would be helpfull if you pointed me in the right direction
I use delta,317.

1.I need,somewhere like the quest bar,for it to say time online for the player,and the uptime of the server.
2.I need it so when you talk to someone,like lumbridge guide,he gives you a tour of my server,i think rune source did it or,something like that.
3.How can i make it so when playerrights = 3 log in,it sends a message out
4. how can i have an npc sayin the amount of players online,and another saying that the owner is online/offline,depending on what it is.</description>
