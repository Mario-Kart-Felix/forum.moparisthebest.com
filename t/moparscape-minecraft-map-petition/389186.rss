    <title>MoparScape Minecraft Map Petition</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-minecraft-map-petition/389186</link>
    <description>I am making a petition to bring back the original minecraft map. The map has been changed so many times it&#39;s unbelievable, and I and many others would agree that bringing back the original map back would be a great choice. The original map was starting to gain a currency of wood, as many forest fires purged most of the wood and so therefore wood was very scarce. Players would venture out far just to find a tiny bit of wood, etc. No more spawn towns, I miss mitbs mountain hideout and toms and mine little cave house. 

Anyone agree? Vote in the poll.</description>

<span class="bbcode-b">We aren’t taking another vote</span>, so don’t bother posting whether you want a complete/march 1st/no reset.  I’m still seeing if I can restore a recent one.<br>

IF we do a reset, <span class="bbcode-b">I’ll find some way to host the old map</span> so people can at least download it if they did a lot of work, like we all did.<br>
