    <title>Win 7 64 bit error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/win-7-64-bit-error/383560</link>
    <description>Recently my Desktop running Windows xp 32 bit which I&#39;ve used for a long time coding crashed forcing me to use my Windows 7 64 bit Laptop to code. Every-time I run a client I log in take 2 steps(literally) and I get this crash error.

I was told to try downloading Java 32 bit, I did that still did it, re-booted. Still did it. No matter what I&#39;ve tried. It still does it. I searched around and they said the same thing, download Java 32 bit. But there has to be some other way... 

This is not just 1 client, it does it for all clients. 317, 474, 508, 525, 614, ect. I can load and play Webclients fine, but I hate using them. Any suggestions to help me?</description>
