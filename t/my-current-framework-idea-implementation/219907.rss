    <description>Here we go.

EDIT: An even newer version, with the module loading portion implemented. :)</description>

<p>I wouldn’t really attribute it to Aryan. It’s more or less a common approach used by many programs. XChat and Anope (IRC services) just to name a few. In other words, it’s a standard methodology for implementing modular portions of software.</p>
<p>That’s not a good way to look after the events. Is there a way we can load them into the JVM so that they can be used like normal classes?</p>
<p>EDIT: Still considering moving some of the PacketHandler/Event implementations into the core package of hybridscape. We can still have the Modules directory for 3rd party modules, but if we’re supplying things like Walking, Chatting, Commands and so on then they would probably be better off in the core package.</p>

<p>I suppose the other alternative is to make some form of EventFactory that maps Strings to Event implementations.<br>
EventFactory.getEvent(“Eventname”); would return a new instance of the correct Event.</p>
<p>So that we can avoid reflection, we can have developers add a static method to each implementation that EventManager can call - this method can return a new instance of the particular event based on whatever arguments.</p>

              <p>Wow. I never knew that you (Lothy) were interested in RSPS.</p>
<p>I’m not very familiar with Apache MINA at all, but that shouldn’t be much of a problem.</p>
<p>Any plans on the final product/result? Are you going to be hosting it? If so, who, and where? Will this be another ‘advertising scheme’ for the website? If not, then what?</p>
<p>Just a few questions.</p>
