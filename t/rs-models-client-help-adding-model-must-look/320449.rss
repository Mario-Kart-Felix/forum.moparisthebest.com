    <description>I added teh model and compile, everything works but how do I get it to change its name to what I want? I made a weapon called brutal battleaxe, which was dragon battleaxe, but I want it to when you right click it, it says brutal battleaxe, and not dragon battleaxe. In my source I change it so in the attack modes it says it, but just not when you right click it, Im pretty sure its in the client but Idk what file, need help someone please respond, and if wrong section I am sorry but I need help and it says ask for help? if your going to lock or remove please answer first! =( ty!! thanks 4 helping!</description>
