    <title>Do not play RSCE or RSCDaemon</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/do-not-play-rsce-or-rscdaemon/436423</link>
    <description>Luke(the owner) is an idiot

Not going to make a tl;dr post so I&#39;ll sum it up.

Played it for a few weeks, so i decided to donate 50$ to help the server out because so far it was good. Turns out most people on that server suck at staking so I become one of the top 5 richest players with about 250m cash... word got out that I had alot of cash so one of his corrupt mods gave out my IP to a hacker and they somehow installed a RAT onto my computer (no i didn&#39;t visit any websites etc)

Account got hacked so I asked Kryptix(luke) for my account back.. didn&#39;t care about the cash at all. He then banned my account and deleted it and muted 2 new characters I made asking him why. I made a final character and a mod PM&#39;ed me saying if I donate 100$ to the server I will get my account back. LOL

Kid doesn&#39;t care about hosting servers at all, all he wants is $

IGN was Military, I&#39;m sure some of your RSCE players will vouch this story.



Btw, I&#39;m not &quot;new&quot; to this forum at all I just don&#39;t ever post, been here since 06 and have played 3-4 RSC private servers since then.

My fav was PP2p :p</description>

<p>I’m not trying to be a dick, just saying  with all the complaints even if your switching to something better, you always want to keep your customers best interest and let’s face it, your server is a business  and you want to exceed your goals.</p>
<p>Only way  you can make them truly happy is make policy post them in there own personal section when ever a problem occurs,   they can read on the best way they can get that problem taken care of.</p>
<p>hell if i wore you i make all mods invisible no way to speak on global  make um like shadows in the back ground it would make it were no bull shit could be said about any of um <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Stop crying and get over it.[/quote]<br>
sorry pomp i like you bro but how much is he paying you ?</p>
<p>its true we all know that he’s a  jerk and he should probably learn how to manage his business a lil better .<br>
I think if he really cared about rsce and his player base, he would address the complaints in a more professional manner rather then sounding like a complete prick.</p>
<p>Ill give him his credit he knows how to keep a server running,  but it looks like it may be coming to a stop.</p>

The company doesnt have a 1800 number and if they do get contacted they are going to want way more then a fucking kid saying someone stole someones gp on a game or anything.

<ul>
<li>Story starts with me needing $750-1000 for something online and not wanting to spend my real life $$ on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>First I started ratting rs2 noobs in the G.E. I got about 2b in a week in a half… not bad. - made $1100 off it. I then decided I would like to play rsc again since of course its my bread and butter… Rsce is obviously the only server with a player base and gp that means anything. So i bought Hotspot Shield Pro, ProVpsn and a few other ip programs. I created multiple characters and spammed the game for 2-3 days with 3 different jdb sites promising noobs the best rsc experience of there lives… Idiots starting popping up on BlackShades like nats…I started checking logs and found I got a some guys with 1b-2b each, plus a idiot mod. So of course i got on a few different ips, pked the characters with items in invy or used the party room and also had some nice drop parties. I then threw out there passwords to detour me from being caught. Then found a few noobs who didn’t wanna pay 7 dollars for a lousy subscription. Made about 800-1000 dollars in 2 days via western union. Still had about 15-20 hats left so decided to stake them a bit. Won a few…lost a few… sold the rest. Then decided to recheck some characters and found about 20-30 more phats and about 200m cash… still had them up until today when I sold all of it to another player.</p>
<p>I was never caught, I was never banned. Luke did not take care of anything. If the kid was smart at all he would spawn him some gold and sell to players because that makes 1000x what his server makes in donations… It might ruin the economy but who cares the damn servers going to be down when he puts up his new trash server.</p>
<p>Feel free to rant,rave, demand proof… I got all of it.</p>

Every ip you try will fail and as I write this I am updating my ip again, BUT PLEASE!! waste your time and try to get me. We all know your going to rage after seeing how much I pwnt you for and how many characters I unbanned with lots and lotsa geepee. Deny it all you want, make up some reasons how I didn’t, everyone here knows how you are, and since i will be banned shortly for showing that I RAT I just gotta say… I look forward to selling all your players gold again in the near future.</p>

If you didn’t know, he can easily get you caught, all he has to do is to check which proxy you used, let’s say you use hotspot shield, now, only thing he has to do is to ask who used the ip at the time the char got hacked, and explain why he needs to have it, they will sure give your ip out, because what you do is illegal and against their terms of service. You’re retarded for thinking you can’t get caught just cuz you use proxies.</p>

So of course i got on a few different ips, pked the characters with items in invy or used the party room and also had some nice drop parties. I then threw out there passwords to detour me from being caught. Then found a few noobs who didn’t wanna pay 7 dollars for a lousy subscription. Made about 800-1000 dollars in 2 days via western union. Still had about 15-20 hats left so decided to stake them a bit. Won a few…lost a few… sold the rest. Then decided to recheck some characters and found about 20-30 more phats and about 200m cash… still had them up until today when I sold all of it to another player.</p>
<p>I was never caught, I was never banned. Luke did not take care of anything. If the kid was smart at all he would spawn him some gold and sell to players because that makes 1000x what his server makes in donations… It might ruin the economy but who cares the damn servers going to be down when he puts up his new trash server.</p>
<p>Feel free to rant,rave, demand proof… I got all of it.</p>
<p>heres a bit…</p>
<p>PS. Luke You Pedo, You can try to retaliate but you will not get me, I use way to many proxies and my real computer ip will not be found. Every ip you try will fail and as I write this I am updating my ip again, BUT PLEASE!! waste your time and try to get me. We all know your going to rage after seeing how much I pwnt you for and how many characters I unbanned with lots and lotsa geepee. Deny it all you want, make up some reasons how I didn’t, everyone here knows how you are, and since i will be banned shortly for showing that I RAT I just gotta say… I look forward to selling all your players gold again in the near future.</p>
<p>Thank you for the - Kinect Sensor, $1600 total via Western Union, new car exhaust system, new ram air hood, and MY FAVORITE, MY NEW ALIENWARE LAPTOP <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> All in less then a week by the way.</p>

But, if it actually wasn’t a government computer, there is nothing that can happen to him.<br>
Also, if it was a government computer, I’d suggest you tell whoever that RSCE is illegal and they’ll forward it to the right people.</p>
