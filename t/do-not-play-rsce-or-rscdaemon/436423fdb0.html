Played it for a few weeks, so i decided to donate 50$ to help the server out because so far it was good. Turns out most people on that ser&amp;hellip;">

        <p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:54, topic:436423”][ol][li]OP got hacked because he visited a URL spammed in-game advertising another private server that was actually a RAT.[/li]<br>
[li]OP claimed a staff member gave out his IP because they knew he was rich and the hacker managed to install a RAT on his PC using only his IP address.[/li]<br>
[li]OP claimed he was using a Government PC in an attempt to scare the hacker.[/li]<br>
[li]OP continuously blamed everyone but himself, criticising the staff and management for his mistake.[/li]<br>
[li]OP went even more mental when I told him the only way to recover his account was via his recovery questions which he did not set despite being warned every time he logged in.[/li]<br>
[li]I looked into the situation and all associated accounts of the hacker was banned. No items could be recovered.[/li]<br>
[li]OP was warned multiple times that if he didn’t stop spamming Global Chat on various accounts he would be banned. OP continued. And continued some more.[/li]<br>
[li]OP was eventually banned.[/li]<br>
[li]OP then comes onto Mopar making up bullshit to exaggerate the situation and severity claiming that a moderator wanted 100$ PayPal to unban him. This did not happen.[/li]<br>
[li]The anti-Kryptix brigade feel this is an appropriate time to side with anyone that isn’t Kryptix.[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>And for anyone that thinks it’s ‘harsh’ for him being banned, I can’t let someone spout bullshit continuously in-game to 200 players online especially when they’re claiming the staff are giving out IP addresses which allows your computer to be instantly hacked. Not everyone is computer literate and it’s that kind of malicious shit that gives private servers a bad name.</p>
<p>The kid is a tool and anyone that actually believes the rubbish that comes out of his mouth needs their head checking.[/quote]</p>
<p>Gotta put my 2 cents in since I was the one using a JDB to get all these rsce noobs lol…</p>
<ul>
<li>Story starts with me needing $750-1000 for something online and not wanting to spend my real life $$ on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>First I started ratting rs2 noobs in the G.E. I got about 2b in a week in a half… not bad. - made $1100 off it. I then decided I would like to play rsc again since of course its my bread and butter… Rsce is obviously the only server with a player base and gp that means anything. So i bought Hotspot Shield Pro, ProVpsn and a few other ip programs. I created multiple characters and spammed the game for 2-3 days with 3 different jdb sites promising noobs the best rsc experience of there lives… Idiots starting popping up on BlackShades like nats…I started checking logs and found I got a some guys with 1b-2b each, plus a idiot mod. So of course i got on a few different ips, pked the characters with items in invy or used the party room and also had some nice drop parties. I then threw out there passwords to detour me from being caught. Then found a few noobs who didn’t wanna pay 7 dollars for a lousy subscription. Made about 800-1000 dollars in 2 days via western union. Still had about 15-20 hats left so decided to stake them a bit. Won a few…lost a few… sold the rest. Then decided to recheck some characters and found about 20-30 more phats and about 200m cash… still had them up until today when I sold all of it to another player.</p>
<p>I was never caught, I was never banned. Luke did not take care of anything. If the kid was smart at all he would spawn him some gold and sell to players because that makes 1000x what his server makes in donations… It might ruin the economy but who cares the damn servers going to be down when he puts up his new trash server.</p>
<p>Feel free to rant,rave, demand proof… I got all of it.</p>
<p>heres a bit…</p>
<p>PS. Luke You Pedo, You can try to retaliate but you will not get me, I use way to many proxies and my real computer ip will not be found. Every ip you try will fail and as I write this I am updating my ip again, BUT PLEASE!! waste your time and try to get me. We all know your going to rage after seeing how much I pwnt you for and how many characters I unbanned with lots and lotsa geepee. Deny it all you want, make up some reasons how I didn’t, everyone here knows how you are, and since i will be banned shortly for showing that I RAT I just gotta say… I look forward to selling all your players gold again in the near future.</p>
<p>Thank you for the - Kinect Sensor, $1600 total via Western Union, new car exhaust system, new ram air hood, and MY FAVORITE, MY NEW ALIENWARE LAPTOP <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> All in less then a week by the way.</p>

If you didn’t know, he can easily get you caught, all he has to do is to check which proxy you used, let’s say you use hotspot shield, now, only thing he has to do is to ask who used the ip at the time the char got hacked, and explain why he needs to have it, they will sure give your ip out, because what you do is illegal and against their terms of service. You’re retarded for thinking you can’t get caught just cuz you use proxies.</p>

[li]OP went even more mental when I told him the only way to recover his account was via his recovery questions which he did not set despite being warned every time he logged in.[/li]<br>
[li]I looked into the situation and all associated accounts of the hacker was banned. No items could be recovered.[/li]<br>
[li]OP was warned multiple times that if he didn’t stop spamming Global Chat on various accounts he would be banned. OP continued. And continued some more.[/li]<br>
[li]OP was eventually banned.[/li]<br>
[li]OP then comes onto Mopar making up bullshit to exaggerate the situation and severity claiming that a moderator wanted 100$ PayPal to unban him. This did not happen.[/li]<br>
[li]The anti-Kryptix brigade feel this is an appropriate time to side with anyone that isn’t Kryptix.[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>And for anyone that thinks it’s ‘harsh’ for him being banned, I can’t let someone spout bullshit continuously in-game to 200 players online especially when they’re claiming the staff are giving out IP addresses which allows your computer to be instantly hacked. Not everyone is computer literate and it’s that kind of malicious shit that gives private servers a bad name.</p>

<p>Gotta put my 2 cents in since I was the one using a JDB to get all these rsce noobs lol…</p>
<ul>
<li>Story starts with me needing $750-1000 for something online and not wanting to spend my real life $$ on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>First I started ratting rs2 noobs in the G.E. I got about 2b in a week in a half… not bad. - made $1100 off it. I then decided I would like to play rsc again since of course its my bread and butter… Rsce is obviously the only server with a player base and gp that means anything. So i bought Hotspot Shield Pro, ProVpsn and a few other ip programs. I created multiple characters and spammed the game for 2-3 days with 3 different jdb sites promising noobs the best rsc experience of there lives… Idiots starting popping up on BlackShades like nats…I started checking logs and found I got a some guys with 1b-2b each, plus a idiot mod. So of course i got on a few different ips, pked the characters with items in invy or used the party room and also had some nice drop parties. I then threw out there passwords to detour me from being caught. Then found a few noobs who didn’t wanna pay 7 dollars for a lousy subscription. Made about 800-1000 dollars in 2 days via western union. Still had about 15-20 hats left so decided to stake them a bit. Won a few…lost a few… sold the rest. Then decided to recheck some characters and found about 20-30 more phats and about 200m cash… still had them up until today when I sold all of it to another player.</p>
<p>I was never caught, I was never banned. Luke did not take care of anything. If the kid was smart at all he would spawn him some gold and sell to players because that makes 1000x what his server makes in donations… It might ruin the economy but who cares the damn servers going to be down when he puts up his new trash server.</p>
<p>Feel free to rant,rave, demand proof… I got all of it.</p>
<p>heres a bit…</p>

<p>PS. Luke You Pedo, You can try to retaliate but you will not get me, I use way to many proxies and my real computer ip will not be found. Every ip you try will fail and as I write this I am updating my ip again, BUT PLEASE!! waste your time and try to get me. We all know your going to rage after seeing how much I pwnt you for and how many characters I unbanned with lots and lotsa geepee. Deny it all you want, make up some reasons how I didn’t, everyone here knows how you are, and since i will be banned shortly for showing that I RAT I just gotta say… I look forward to selling all your players gold again in the near future.</p>
<p>Thank you for the - Kinect Sensor, $1600 total via Western Union, new car exhaust system, new ram air hood, and MY FAVORITE, MY NEW ALIENWARE LAPTOP <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> All in less then a week by the way.[/quote]</p>

        <p>I am an idiot knowing ive been doing this along time and hes not the first person to even remotely try and come after me. The ips are used by thousands of people and kryptex has no clue when the fuck it was hacked. The company doesnt have a 1800 number and if they do get contacted they are going to want way more then a fucking kid saying someone stole someones gp on a game or anything. THEY WILL WANT PROOF FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT… I’m clearly not an idiot and you are clearly jealous.</p>

        <p>For the bump, but the person above with all the RATS. I believe he still has people infected, I’m not sure though but someone was hacked on my server yesterday because they were infected and they had a RAT on their computer which I removed for them.</p>
<p>It was located @</p>

<p>Also</p>

<p>The files are hidden even when I turned the View &gt; Show Hidden Files.</p>
<p>Also remove it from Msconfig. I’m just guessing its the same person above because the person on my server said he only played RSCE and other private servers on his computer(RSC).</p>
<p>Just a note to check that whoever plays RSC Servers or whoever might think they’re infected.</p>

        <p>[quote=“TheAlmightyKing, post:74, topic:436423”]For the bump, but the person above with all the RATS. I believe he still has people infected, I’m not sure though but someone was hacked on my server yesterday because they were infected and they had a RAT on their computer which I removed for them.</p>
<p>It was located @</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"C:/users/(username)/AppData/Local/Temp/iedevtool.exe"</code></pre>
<p>Also</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"C:/users/(username)/AppData/Roaming/Sysglobal.exe"</code></pre>
<p>The files are hidden even when I turned the View &gt; Show Hidden Files.</p>
<p>Also remove it from Msconfig. I’m just guessing its the same person above because the person on my server said he only played RSCE and other private servers on his computer(RSC).</p>
<p>Just a note to check that whoever plays RSC Servers or whoever might think they’re infected.[/quote]</p>
<p>doubt it’s the same person, the guy who hacked me was an active hackforum member and he was qqing on there about his paypals getting hacked due to himself having a RAT lmao</p>

        <p>[quote=“Pompano21, post:34, topic:436423”]You can’t just blame Luke because you installed something on your computer and got hacked. If people could install stuff on your computer through an IP then there would be a lot more people being hacked.</p>
<p>Stop crying and get over it.[/quote]<br>
sorry pomp i like you bro but how much is he paying you ?</p>
<p>its true we all know that he’s a  jerk and he should probably learn how to manage his business a lil better .<br>
I think if he really cared about rsce and his player base, he would address the complaints in a more professional manner rather then sounding like a complete prick.</p>
<p>Ill give him his credit he knows how to keep a server running,  but it looks like it may be coming to a stop.</p>

<p>It’s only coming to a stop because I haven’t touched RSCE in months. It will boom again when we launch RSCD.</p>
<p>As I’ve said before, I see RSCE as a trial run and yes I’ve made mistakes but so has everyone else. RSCD will be ran a lot differently but no doubt certain people will hold grudges and be negative regardless.</p>
