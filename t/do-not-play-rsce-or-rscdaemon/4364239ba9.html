<p>You can’t just blame Luke because you installed something on your computer and got hacked. If people could install stuff on your computer through an IP then there would be a lot more people being hacked.</p>

<p>Hey Nolife, I understand that you are fine with his post and agree with him but that has to be expected from people like you which every post you make that Kryptix name is in you jump right on and talk shit about him.</p>
<p>Do you have a crush on kryptix or something?<br>
[/quote]Looking at the way you’re right on his dick, I’d say you’re closer to the whole crush thing.<br>
As for his post, he clearly said that a mod asked him to donate 100$ to get unbanned.<br>
Also, tell me how he SHOULD be banned for asking people to look into him getting hacked.</p>

<p>No I have no crush on him, I just think your an idiot.</p>
<p>Also, I guess Jagex are complete morons because when you got hacked on the real thing they did fuck all about it from what I remember. He was spamming global and got warned multiple times which even a couple of rsce players stated in this thread. So your point is completely invalid. He was not banned for getting hacked, he was banned for spamming global and not stopping from what I can see. Stop being a little bitch and you read the thread.</p>

<p>You can’t just blame Luke because you installed something on your computer and got hacked. If people could install stuff on your computer through an IP then there would be a lot more people being hacked.</p>

<p>Yeah, he said a mod gave out his Ip and someone ratted him. That statement would not be true. If Kryptix can not find any proof of who hacked him and he did not set his recoveries then it is his own fault for downloading some kind of virus which would be from most likely using some kind of bot.</p>
<p>Hey Nolife, I understand that you are fine with his post and agree with him but that has to be expected from people like you which every post you make that Kryptix name is in you jump right on and talk shit about him.</p>
<p>Do you have a crush on kryptix or something?<br>
[/quote]Looking at the way you’re right on his dick, I’d say you’re closer to the whole crush thing.<br>
As for his post, he clearly said that a mod asked him to donate 100$ to get unbanned.<br>
Also, tell me how he SHOULD be banned for asking people to look into him getting hacked.</p>

<p>rofl this propoganda. You fools realize that everyone has made their mind up about luke by now, and that you guys making shit up and trying to twist his/your words into making him look bad is accomplishing absolutely nothing, right?</p>

<p>Naw i actually just learned today how much of a fuckface he is and there are plenty others who need to realize such as yourself you fucking fool.<br>
[/quote]you’re missing the point. you should not care about how much of a fuckface he is. If you are being a responsible player, following rules (yes, those are meant to be followed, and you agree to them when you register an account) then you will not be “fucked with” on his server. We’re on the internet, you are the one that needs to realize</p>

</aside>
<p>It has been made clear, that if you get hacked and ask for help or you DARE say anything about his mods/admins, you will be banned no questions asked.<br>
Now, correct me if I’m wrong, but, isnt he supposed to be the referee not the executioner?</p>

</aside>
<p>No I have no crush on him, I just think your an idiot.</p>
<p>Also, I guess Jagex are complete morons because when you got hacked on the real thing they did fuck all about it from what I remember. He was spamming global and got warned multiple times which even a couple of rsce players stated in this thread. So your point is completely invalid. He was not banned for getting hacked, he was banned for spamming global and not stopping from what I can see. Stop being a little bitch and you read the thread.[/quote]Let me make it as clear as possible.<br>
Looking from the outside, what you’re doing right now is excusing Luke for not controlling his mods.<br>
I totally understand where the poster is coming from, he was hacked, neglected by the mods and he got angry.<br>
Of course, the easy thing was to ban him and say that its his own fault.<br>
But, if it was any other server, for example rsca, admins would look into the case and actually do their job instead of abusing their powers having fun ingame.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Kryptix, post:54, topic:436423”][ol][li]OP got hacked because he visited a URL spammed in-game advertising another private server that was actually a RAT.[/li]<br>
[li]OP claimed a staff member gave out his IP because they knew he was rich and the hacker managed to install a RAT on his PC using only his IP address.[/li]<br>
[li]OP claimed he was using a Government PC in an attempt to scare the hacker.[/li]<br>
[li]OP continuously blamed everyone but himself, criticising the staff and management for his mistake.[/li]<br>
[li]OP went even more mental when I told him the only way to recover his account was via his recovery questions which he did not set despite being warned every time he logged in.[/li]<br>
[li]I looked into the situation and all associated accounts of the hacker was banned. No items could be recovered.[/li]<br>
[li]OP was warned multiple times that if he didn’t stop spamming Global Chat on various accounts he would be banned. OP continued. And continued some more.[/li]<br>
[li]OP was eventually banned.[/li]<br>
[li]OP then comes onto Mopar making up bullshit to exaggerate the situation and severity claiming that a moderator wanted 100$ PayPal to unban him. This did not happen.[/li]<br>
[li]The anti-Kryptix brigade feel this is an appropriate time to side with anyone that isn’t Kryptix.[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>And for anyone that thinks it’s ‘harsh’ for him being banned, I can’t let someone spout bullshit continuously in-game to 200 players online especially when they’re claiming the staff are giving out IP addresses which allows your computer to be instantly hacked. Not everyone is computer literate and it’s that kind of malicious shit that gives private servers a bad name.</p>
<p>The kid is a tool and anyone that actually believes the rubbish that comes out of his mouth needs their head checking.[/quote]</p>
<p>lol at number 4, if hes in the navy and hes on a navy base that is considered a government computer fuck head.</p>

But, if it actually wasn’t a government computer, there is nothing that can happen to him.<br>
Also, if it was a government computer, I’d suggest you tell whoever that RSCE is illegal and they’ll forward it to the right people.</p>
