    <description>this is a 317/608 server i have been working on for a while.
the base is from hack3r&#39;s but i am re-making it into something better then what it is now.

so far i added a new home
fixed some dced connections but not all of them
fixed how sof determine the rate on items giving as prizes.
fixed the bank interface so now it looks like what it can really do instead of what it cant by that i mean it had a blank button that was suppose to be for extra tabs but did nothing so i made
look more natural so its less confusing for some people.
i have made the login back ground more realistic to runescape.
added some extra command features.
made it into a 2 world server. the first server is for people that want to play normally the second server is a spawn server with shops commands too.
i have changed the cache folder location and added it inside the client so that it will no longer say error connection since its would be a aio file.
i have made it so that i can let char files from both worlds be the same or have there own files. (they have there own player files)

future plans is:

adding a GE and then making it work between players like the real GE
adding a message system between both worlds.
having a auto updater run before the client loads so that everything is updated instead of downloading it by hand.
turning it from a 317/608 to a 317/718 but that will be the hardest part i think...
extending the number of npcs that can be loaded into the server at once to make it more spread out and possibly leading to actual custom quest.
adding a auto double exp weekend system but only for world 1 as world 2 gets the spawn commands and shop commands.
fixing the banking all and the selling to npc dc connection error.
fixing the pet not being able to be picked up error.
adding a clickable commands window so that people don&#39;t have to look up what kind there are and theirs going to be 4 sets regular donator mod admin+</description>
