        <p>this is a 317/608 server i have been working on for a while.<br>
the base is from hack3r’s but i am re-making it into something better then what it is now.</p>
<p>so far i added a new home<br>
fixed some dced connections but not all of them<br>
fixed how sof determine the rate on items giving as prizes.<br>
fixed the bank interface so now it looks like what it can really do instead of what it cant by that i mean it had a blank button that was suppose to be for extra tabs but did nothing so i made<br>
look more natural so its less confusing for some people.<br>
i have made the login back ground more realistic to runescape.<br>
added some extra command features.<br>
made it into a 2 world server. the first server is for people that want to play normally the second server is a spawn server with shops commands too.<br>
i have changed the cache folder location and added it inside the client so that it will no longer say error connection since its would be a aio file.<br>
i have made it so that i can let char files from both worlds be the same or have there own files. (they have there own player files)</p>
<p>future plans is:</p>
<p>adding a GE and then making it work between players like the real GE<br>
adding a message system between both worlds.<br>
having a auto updater run before the client loads so that everything is updated instead of downloading it by hand.<br>
turning it from a 317/608 to a 317/718 but that will be the hardest part i think…<br>
extending the number of npcs that can be loaded into the server at once to make it more spread out and possibly leading to actual custom quest.<br>
adding a auto double exp weekend system but only for world 1 as world 2 gets the spawn commands and shop commands.<br>
fixing the banking all and the selling to npc dc connection error.<br>
fixing the pet not being able to be picked up error.<br>
adding a clickable commands window so that people don’t have to look up what kind there are and theirs going to be 4 sets regular donator mod admin+</p>
