    <title>Religious Presentation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/religious-presentation/285163</link>
    <description>I need to do a presentation on something which has ethical/moral issues and can be linked with religion. Can&#39;t just talk about a specific religion, and can&#39;t talk about something unrelated such as the ethics of social networking.

Any ideas?</description>

<p>You could talk about how countries are biased for religions. For example, if you were say, Muslim and tried running for president in the US, you wouldn’t be the president.</p>
<p>You could also talk about how a majority of the wars in the past were due to religious differences. In which case the wars would be in vain considering everyone there would be hypocritical-- religion calls for peace. Just talk about how ironic religion is, because we try using it for everything it’s against.</p>
<p>And last but not least, jot a note that politics really shouldn’t be mixed with religion. Politics calls for fact, religion is based on opinion. Yet, it’s been mixed so many times before it seems as if it’s completely ignored.</p>
