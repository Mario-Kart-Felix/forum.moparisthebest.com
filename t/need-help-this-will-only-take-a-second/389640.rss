    <description>Is there any working clients for the classic source &quot;PimpScape&quot; ?

I have tried using the Silabsoft client, but the client doesn&#39;t work, Then I tried MoparScape client and it crashes. Any suggestions?

And yes I am hosting a very old source, Don&#39;t ask why.

I AM ALSO USING A WINDOWS 7 LAPTOP. It is known to crash most clients, is this why?</description>
