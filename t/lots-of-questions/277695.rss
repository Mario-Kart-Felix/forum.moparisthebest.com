              <p>1.) You must edit autospawn.cfg not just use the ::npc command<br>
2.)Unless changed in client.java they should stay still<br>
3.)Client.java<br>
4.)Under your commands void. Not difficult at all<br>
5.)npc.java<br>
6.)Add them to wanneshops so they will open and edit shops.cfg<br>
7.)Add the portal in makeGlobalObject and add something like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ifobject == ++++
X- ++++
Y- ++++</code></pre>
<p>I Dont do portals much &gt;.&gt;<br>
8.)Instead of emote == ++++ change it to something like a teleport<br>
9.)Their should be some kind of ::char command if not just look for a redesign void.</p>
