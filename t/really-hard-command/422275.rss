              <p>The way I’d do it is create a method that gets the player’s location +1 x/y and -1 x/y, and if there are any other players on +1 or -1 x/y.</p>
<p>I don’t know your methods, so something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void checkPlayerPerimeter(Client c, Player p) {//c being you, p being all other players
    try {
        for(Player p : World.getWorld().getPlayers()) {
            if (p == null){
                continue;
            }

            if (((c.getLocation() - 1) || (c.getLocation() + 1)) == (p.getLocation())) {
                p.getXpForLevel[3] == 0;
                p.applyDead();
            }
        }
    } catch (exception e) {
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>and then for a command I would add the simple call to this method. Or just add that into the command itself… and of course this isn’t going to work it’s just an opinion of concept to help you see how it should work.</p>
<p>Good luck, and yeah I just wrote that all from the top of my head (using a mixture of Hyperion and Winterlove methods hehe).</p>
<p>Edit: in text, you want to first check the player’s location minus one and plus one in both (x, y) directions AND check if another player’s locations =='s your location (minus the one’s), if that is true then applyDead/0 hp, otherwise send a message stating that there was no one to kill or whatever.</p>
