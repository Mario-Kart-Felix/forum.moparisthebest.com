    <description>Hey guys, just got back from a week in sharm el sheikh (egypt).
I know for a fact none of you care that i was gone for such a lengthy time hehe.
But anyways thought i&#39;d post this to say that it was the best holiday ive ever been on.
It wasnt an expensive hotel at all but it was still so awesome, the people who worked at the hotel smiled all day long and were so nice :p.
Our room(S) were massive and there were 2 pools, one massive one with a bar built in, and one small heated one.
I also spent alot of my time at the beach snorkeling around the jetty of our hotels own personal beach.
Got to see loads of pretty fish and coral.
But also paniced and stabbed a peice of coral into my foot which was later pulled out by a friendly egyptian man :p hehe.
Also another good thing was i got served alcohol (im 15) .
i drinked so much rum :)

Anyways basic summary of my lovely holiday
also i got a henna tatoo and i know your all jellous.

rate/hate/bake a cake.</description>

<p>That’s good to know. Most of my knowledge of British culture comes from the Harry Potter Books on Tape, which I listen to while forcefully removing the limbs from white supremacists in Soldier of Fortune. The perfect melody for murder is in fact the fifth novelette from JK Rowling.</p>
