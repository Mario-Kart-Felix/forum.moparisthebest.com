              <p>[quote=“go armand, post:3, topic:409181”]place this command under the ‘owner’ section in your commands file.<br>
also, make sure that your player rights are &gt;= 3.</p>
<p>idk if you have to, but once you’ve edited that. close your source if you’re running it.<br>
save your commands file<br>
compile the source.<br>
and run the source again.</p>
<p>if this still doesnt work. then i have no freaking clue <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>forgots to mention, if you attempt to change your player rights. make sure your account is logged out before editing the file.<br>
once you’ve changed rights to 3. then save and log in.[/quote]</p>
