    <title>Cache editing help. (Don&#39;t be afraid lol)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-editing-help-dont-be-afraid-lol/190001</link>
    <description>Ok, here it goes.  I know how to add normal NPCs.  However, some of the NPCs I want to add have multiply models (like the head is in one .dat, the torso and legs are in another .dat).  For instance, general graador, his head, hands, and feet are in 1 .dat, but his torso, and legs, are in another.  The thing I need to know is what to do to add the npc, as 1 id (put all the models together as 1 npc).  It&#39;s probably not that hard, but please help me.</description>
