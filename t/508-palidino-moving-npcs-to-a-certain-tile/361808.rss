    <title>[508 Palidino] Moving npcs to a certain tile</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-palidino-moving-npcs-to-a-certain-tile/361808</link>
    <description>I asked questions like this before, got a bunch of useless answers. So I decided to try here :)

I&#39;m currently coding cutscenes, and I would like some help on this one subject. Is there a way to move an NPC (no not with npcspawn.cfg).

I have the NPC called npc already declared, and i have full access to the npc (I can animate it, make it face the player etc.), how can I make the npc move to a certain tile? For example, if there was a method such as npc.move(x, y), but i do not see such a thing, is this something I have to add myself or does it exist yet I do not know of it?</description>
