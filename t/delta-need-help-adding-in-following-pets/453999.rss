    <title>[Delta] Need help adding in following pets</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-need-help-adding-in-following-pets/453999</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve spent the last three days looking at various tutorials(including Marcbob&#39;s), and none of them seem to work, be it that they&#39;re too source specific, or just too outdated for me to convert to Delta. 
If it&#39;s important, the specific source is the newest PkPlanet.

 Does anyone know of any tutorials they can point me to? Or better yet, have their own method I can use?</description>

              <p>I was converting summoning tutorials before, but to no avail. QQ the best I have managed to do is make npcs follow players, but they’re far from functional as pets.<br>
Also: I’ll remember about the rsgp thing.</p>

If you want payment I have a fair bit of rsgp, not doing something insane like giving 40m though.[/quote]<br>
All help on this forum is for free. You cannot charge any form of payment or give any form of payment.<br>
And I don’t think that anyone have added this in delta or he did but he haven’t and maybe won’t release.<br>
I don’t know if it will help you but take a look at your player following system. Maybe that make some things clear.</p>
