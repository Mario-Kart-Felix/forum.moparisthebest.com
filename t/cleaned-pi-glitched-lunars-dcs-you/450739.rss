    <title>[Cleaned PI] Glitched Lunars | Dc&#39;s You</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cleaned-pi-glitched-lunars-dcs-you/450739</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a cleaned out PI for a base. It has lunars &amp; a lunar altar, but when I try to switch to lunars (via altar or command) it completely dc&#39;s you, and when you log back in, if you click on your magic book, you get dc&#39;d... does anyone know a fix or can anybody send me a link on how to fix this? It would be greatly appreciated, as I&#39;ve already done a lot on this server so far :)</description>

              <p>Take a look at your lunar spellbook code and try to find any error in it. You can compare it with a working lunar system to check it.</p>
