    <title>317 PI client Need Help Please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-pi-client-need-help-please/392964</link>
    <description>okay so, me and my friend are making a new 317 pi server. it works we have it online and now i am begging to code it on my computer. the problem however is i can only code it over at his house for some reason. when i come to my house i cant log on it says error connecting to server. and yes i do change the ip to my ip. i do however have the 2nd ip in the client.java as 127.0.0.1 because i do not have any desire to have it online right now. if anyone knows if im forgetting to change something in the client or if i need to change something in the source to get this to work i would greatly appreciate. thanks</description>
