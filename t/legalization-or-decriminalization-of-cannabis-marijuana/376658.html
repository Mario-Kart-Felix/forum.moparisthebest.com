<blockquote>How does weed effect the brain? 
The only study claiming brain damage is the rhesus monkey study, done by Dr. Robert Heath in the late 1970’s. The study was heavily criticized for having only 4 subjects to test on and its experimental bias. In order to achieve these results, doses up to 200 times the psychoactive dose in humans were given. A newer study was done by Dr. William Slikker at the National Center for Toxicological Research in Arkansas, and this time 64 rhesus monkeys were used. The monkeys were exposed to marijuana smoke daily or weekly for a year. No evidence of structural or neurochemical changes were found in the brains of the monkeys. A similar study was done by Gordon T. Pryor and Charles Rebert at SRI International in California. Thirty rhesus monkeys inhaled marijuana smoke one to three times a day for periods of 6 to 12 months. Again, no evidence of structural or neurochemical changes were found in the brains of the monkeys. Some behavioral changes in the monkey were noticed, but wore off when they were taken off the marijuana. Two other studies in 1977 that were published by the Journal of the American Medical Association showed no evidence of brain damage in heavy users of marijuana. Contrary to popular belief, killing brain cells is not a prerequisite for getting high.
<p>How does marijuana affect your lungs?<br>
Many anti-drug organizations claim weed is worse than smoking tobacco because it deposits 4 times more tar into your lungs than a filtered cigarette. However, studies that concluded this data used the entire plant when testing the tar content. Marijuana users only smoke the buds, they do not smoke the stems, roots, leaves, and seeds. Later studies tested only the bud, and found that it actually contains 3 times less tar than tobacco. Many tobacco smokers smoke as many as 25 cigarettes a day. A light marijuana smoker might smoke a marijuana joint once every couple of weeks. A heavy user might smoke one joint a day. Marijuana is safer than tobacco. Weed can actually benefit the lungs in some ways. It is an expectorant, which means it helps remove mucus and other materials from the lungs. In addition to this, marijuana dilates the air channels. This gives it the ability to remove smog and other pollutants from the lungs. People who smoke tobacco and weed live an average of 7 years longer than just tobacco smokers. A major concern is that marijuana could cause cancer because it contains some carcinogens. However, a new study done by the University of California has shown marijuana has no link to cancer. The main active chemical in marijuana, THC, has been proven to kill aging and mutating cells and thus preventing cells from becoming cancerous. If a user feels it is not worth the risk of lung damage, they have several other options. A water bong can be used to cool the smoke and filter out many unwanted chemicals from the plant. Another way is to use a vaporizer. A vaporizer heats the marijuana to a certain temperature where only the THC is vaporized, and when a user inhales it they are getting a pure THC vapor and no other plant constituent. The best option for someone trying to avoid lung damage is to consume it orally. The marijuana is cooked into an oil, fat, or alcohol so that it can be absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. This is a sure proof method for avoiding lung damage.</p>
<p>How does marijuana affect hormones?<br>
It is commonly believed that marijuana causes testosterone levels to drop in men. However, this is not true. In 1974, Dr. R.C. Kolodony reported lower testosterone in men who smoke marijuana. A newer study done by Dr. Robert Block from the University of Iowa found that the use of marijuana, even heavy use, has absolutely no effect on testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, prolactin, or cortisol in men or women. Six other studies also failed to show that marijuana lowers testosterone.</p>
<p>What does it do to the immune system?<br>
Another misconception about marijuana is that it harms the immune system. This myth is based on studies where lab rodents were given doses of THC that were about one thousand times the dose needed for psychoactive effects in humans, every day. This is far too high of a dose, and not an accurate reflection to compare it with an average marijuana user. In 30 days, the animals were back to normal again. No study has ever shown an increase in bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection in marijuana users. In fact, three large studies done in the 1970’s in Jamaica, Costa Rica and Greece have found no difference in disease susceptibility for marijuana users. A study done in 1978 and a study done in 1988 both showed that marijuana can actually stimulate the immune system.</p>
<p>The gateway theory. Does marijuana lead to harder drugs?<br>
Many critics of marijuana will argue that even if it isn’t harmful to your health, it is a gateway drug and will lead to the use of harder drugs such as cocaine and heroin.</p>
<p>[quote=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_info14.shtml] A real world<br>
example of what happens when marijuana is readily available can be<br>
found in Holland.  The Dutch partially legalized marijuana in the<br>
1970s.  Since then, hard drug use – heroin and cocaine – have<br>
DECLINED substantially.  If marijuana really were a gateway drug,<br>
one would have expected use of hard drugs to have gone up, not<br>
down.  This apparent “negative gateway” effect has also been<br>
observed in the United States.  Studies done in the early 1970s<br>
showed a negative correlation between use of marijuana and use of<br>
alcohol.  A 1993 Rand Corporation study that compared drug use in<br>
states that had decriminalized marijuana versus those that had not,<br>
found that where marijuana was more available – the states that<br>
had decriminalized – hard drug abuse as measured by emergency room<br>
episodes decreased.  In short, what science and actual experience<br>
tell us is that marijuana tends to substitute for the much more<br>
dangerous hard drugs like alcohol, cocaine, and heroin.<br>
[/quote]<br>
There have been no relationships between the patterns of marijuana and the use of other drugs over time. For instance, in the 1960’s and 1970’s marijuana use increased a lot, but heroin use decreased.</p>
<p>Can you overdose? How many people have died directly from marijuana?<br>
No one in recorded history has ever died from marijuana.</p>
<p>[quote]       Tobacco…340,000 - 395,000<br>
Alcohol (excluding crime/accidents)…125,000+<br>
Drug Overdose (prescription)…24,000 - 27,000<br>
Drug Overdose (illegal)…3,800 - 5,200<br>
Marijuana…0</p>

<p>I would be happy to debate any other health information you have. For now I’ll get onto some more reasons to legalize it.</p>
<p>Drug prohibition causes more crime. If drugs were legalized and regulated, violent drug gangs couldn’t exist, they wouldn’t be able to make money.<br>
If marijuana was legalized, it could be taxed and regulated. The government could make a lot of profit. It would be higher quality and more pure compared to street drugs, thus reducing some of the harms. Laws could be put into place about driving high, or doing it in public. And also lets face it, the law doesn’t influence your descision if your going to smoke it or not, so not everyone is going to suddenly become a stoner if it was legalized. If you were against it before, you will still be against it after.</p>
<p>How about medical marijuana? I’ll keep this short. But if not for recreational users, it needs to be legalized for medical purposes.</p>
<p>Marijuana is a very effective medicine for a wide range of illnesses with very few side effects. It is beneficial to cancer patients in several ways. It helps with the pain and nausea generally associated with cancer, but it is generally used to help combat the nausea and other negative effects caused from chemotherapy. It also stimulates the appetite, which is useful because cancer patients often develop anorexia, the loss of appetite or desire to eat. If a cancer patient is not comfortable with smoking marijuana, they can take the prescription pill Marinol, which is a pill that can be consumed orally and contains THC. And because of the growing evidence of marijuana killing potential cancer cells, it could help in other ways as well.</p>
<p>Marijuana is useful for treating AIDS for many of the same reasons as cancer. AIDS can cause extreme nausea, and marijuana is very effective for curing this. AIDS will also cause a severe loss of appetite. AIDS patients are known to literally waste away, sometimes losing hundreds of pounds. Marijuana will help them eat better and improve their quality of life and even help them live longer.</p>
<p>Another condition that marijuana can help treat is glaucoma, a disease characterized by excessive fluid pressure within the eyeball. Glaucoma can cause severe eye and head pain and nausea and vomiting. Marijuana is good for treating these symptoms, but the reason marijuana is best for treating glaucoma is because it lowers intraocular pressure in the eyeball.</p>
<p>Marijuana has many other medicinal benefits as well. It helps reduce inflammation so if something is swollen, marijuana can help treat it as well as reduce the pain. It can be used to treat many more illnesses such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, the common cold, the flu, and many more. It also helps reduce stress.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Why is alcohol legal, and marijuana not? Alcohol is far more dangerous. <a href="http://www.saferchoice.org/content/view/24/53/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.saferchoice.org/content/view/24/53/</a></p>
<p>Lastly, who the hell thinks they have the right to tell me what I can or cannot do in my own home.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure what kind of legalization they’re talking about, because that’s way too long to read, but in short: No. Why? Because I feel people will get high way more often, especially in public (As if I leave my house anyways) and they’re just more idiots I have to be around. If I could, I would ban beer as well, simply because most drunk people are retarded (In their <span class="bbcode-b">drunk</span> state… hence, “drunk”). However I do support smoking it for the creative mind. Maybe I’ve just been around too many of the stupid people who smoke, like most of the kids at my school and I only see the bad side to it. I’ll keep an open mind though.</p>

        <p>Yes, Although most experts say that if marijuana was legalized it would take the “thrill” out of smoking something illegal for people, in return there wouldn’t be a very big increase in users. Also i’d like to point out marijuana is a VERY common drug and the people that would use it when it’s legalized are already using it. It is a shame how in America alchohol and drugs is frowned upon, mostly because people abuse it. While studying abroad in europe my older brother stated for me in experience in europe consumption of alchohol is an a occasional thing for the everyday person, even for 14-15year olds when they are out to dinner with there parents.</p>

In school we occasionally have assemblies where people tell their bad experiences with drugs, and how it ruined their lives and they’re barely getting back together. Never once have I heard the good sides of drugs, only “DON’T DO IT! IT’LL RUIN YOUR LIFE! YOU’LL REGRET IT FOREVERRRRRRR!!!” and it annoys me.</p>

<p>8 billion annually is spent on Marijuana enforcement, and not to mention the billions people spend illegally to pay for their drugs that ends up in the hands of criminals instead of the government if it was sold legally and taxed. Of course it should be legalized.</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not taking a position either way, but you realize third hand smoke is extremely minimal in terms of ruining your health, right? All the political propaganda about it being terrible and needing to be stopped is mostly a load of shit. First hand smoking rarely even develops cancer, much less indirectly inhaling the breathed out results. It’s almost medically impossible for an average joe to develop lung cancer just by walking down the street and passing 2-3 people smoking tobacco or marijuana.</p>

<p>Prohibition was taking something that was legal and accepted for centuries and making it illegal. Marijuana has been generally illegal since before this country was even founded. I don’t think they are directly applicable.</p>

        <p>If I’m honest, I’m against it. I’ve been brought up knowing that drugs and smoking are bad. I’ve spent all my life trying to get my grandparents to stop smoking and my granddad had to once it caused him to have a minor heart attack (I know this is about cannabis not tobacco), so I feel that it should remain a banned drug.</p>
<p>My best mate at school started smoking before the end of his GCSEs and now he’s a complete lowlife, he was a pretty bright kid, but failed every single one of his exams because he was high. He started once because he was “Stressed”, and if I’m honest he wouldn’t know what stress was if it got up and smacked him one round the face… but that’s a different story.</p>
<p>This drug, I feel, ruins people. It takes their essence away, which is a real shame to see (No offence to those who smoke it, this is just my personal opinion).</p>
<p>I’m nearly 20, so I think I’m at a fair age to comment on this subject. I have never smoked anything and never will, you may say I’m writing this from a biased point of view as I’ve never tried it, but I’ve seen the effects it has on people and it’s not nice.</p>

</aside>
<p>Being against it is one thing. Telling people they aren’t allowed to do it is another.</p>
<p>Prohibition doesn’t ever work in my opinion, and there’s examples in history that prove this.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Prohibition was taking something that was legal and accepted for centuries and making it illegal. Marijuana has been generally illegal since before this country was even founded. I don’t think they are directly applicable.[/quote]<br>
Cannabis was definitely legal, and was one of the biggest agricultural crops of our country (and of the world) up until around the 1880’s. In fact, the very first law in the US regarding Marijuana was in the early 17th century Jamestown Colony. This law declared that all farmers must either grow hemp or cannabis for fiber production and medical purposes. Benjamin Franklin even used it to start one of the first paper mills. The first few copies of the Declaration of Independence were written on Cannabis hemp paper. Up until the 1800s, most of the textiles in the US were made with hemp, and 50% of the marketed medicine was made from Cannabis.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until 1914 (I believe that’s the correct date) that a state (California) passed the first state marijuana prohibition law, criminalizing the preparation of hemp and its products. In the next few decades the rest began to follow.</p>
<p>Then in the 1930’s, the US government really started to make the push to outlaw all drugs. The FBN was formed and started a smear campaign against Marijuana. Heard of yellow journalism? They put out a shit ton of propaganda against the use of Marijuana saying that users were crazy, insane, suicidal, had murderous intentions, etc.</p>
<p>It didn’t become illegal because of these supposed “side effects”. That’s bullshit. Anyone who has smoked Marijuana knows that none of what the FBN said about it in their propaganda is true, and in fact, THEY knew it wasn’t true. And it actually has many positive effects. Just look at jme’s post above. It has numerous medical benefits.</p>
<p>It became illegal because hemp is a cheap substitute for the paper pulp that was used in the newspaper industry as well as for synthetic fibers such as nylon, and because it has amazing medicinal properties and can be grown in your backyard. Corporations that produce and sell medicines would lose huge amounts of money if people could grow their own medicine in their backyard. Conveniently, these corporations now sell Marinol, which contains the same chemical that Marijuana does. THC. Yet instead of us being able to self-medicate, we now can only obtain THC legally if we purchase it at a pharmacy.</p>
<p>Randolph Hearst (newspaper business) and Andrew Mellon (Secretary of the Treasury) both helped in the smear campaign. They helped pass bills that would reduce the size of hemp industry in order to kill of their competition. Hearst had huge investments in the Timber industry, and became substantially richer with the decline of hemp. Mellon, probably the richest man in the country at the time, had even larger investments in the synthetic fiber nylon. Hemp was a very big threat to both the nylon and timber industries. Today in the USA it’s still illegal to grow hemp. You can import it, use it, export it, etc. But you can’t grow it, meaning that it is much more expensive to use than said alternatives, so nobody really uses it. You can’t even get high with industrial hemp, yet it was grouped in with “reefer madness”.</p>
<p>It’s really quite said that we’ve outlawed this amazing, natural plant. It has thousands of uses, yet we refuse to accept it. Not to mention the fact that an estimated 8 billion dollars is spent each year in the US on Marijuana drug enforcement, and this multi-billion dollar market is going into the hands of criminals instead of the government if they would just regulate and tax it.</p>
<p>NOTE: Only the first bit was directed at you, Taharok.</p>

        <p>No point in having marijuana illegal. Why? It’s because we have other products out in the market that do way more damage than marijuana. It may be somewhat “bad” for your health, but what about cigarettes? The money being spent on enforcement can be better spent elsewhere.</p>

I wasn’t meaning to reference the 1920’s prohibition of alcohol, just that the act of prohibiting in general (in my opinion) does not work.</p>
