    <description>This topic was already posted [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,368837.0.html]here[/url] by [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=4]jme[/url] please only reply to this thread in the utmost maturity.
This topic is very current, but i don&#39;t want to gravedig such an old topic so i feel it is justified to continue this discussion in a new thread.
If any staff member or forum authority feels there is not a need for a new topic, please remove and/or lock.

So, What is your guys opinion on this matter? I personally am all for it, as long as alcohol is legal i feel marijuana should be, myself am a frequent user.

Heres is some facts posted by [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=4]jme[/url] in the [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,368837.0.html]previous thread[/url].

&lt;blockquote&gt;How does weed effect the brain? 
The only study claiming brain damage is the rhesus monkey study, done by Dr. Robert Heath in the late 1970’s. The study was heavily criticized for having only 4 subjects to test on and its experimental bias. In order to achieve these results, doses up to 200 times the psychoactive dose in humans were given. A newer study was done by Dr. William Slikker at the National Center for Toxicological Research in Arkansas, and this time 64 rhesus monkeys were used. The monkeys were exposed to marijuana smoke daily or weekly for a year. No evidence of structural or neurochemical changes were found in the brains of the monkeys. A similar study was done by Gordon T. Pryor and Charles Rebert at SRI International in California. Thirty rhesus monkeys inhaled marijuana smoke one to three times a day for periods of 6 to 12 months. Again, no evidence of structural or neurochemical changes were found in the brains of the monkeys. Some behavioral changes in the monkey were noticed, but wore off when they were taken off the marijuana. Two other studies in 1977 that were published by the Journal of the American Medical Association showed no evidence of brain damage in heavy users of marijuana. Contrary to popular belief, killing brain cells is not a prerequisite for getting high.

How does marijuana affect your lungs?
Many anti-drug organizations claim weed is worse than smoking tobacco because it deposits 4 times more tar into your lungs than a filtered cigarette. However, studies that concluded this data used the entire plant when testing the tar content. Marijuana users only smoke the buds, they do not smoke the stems, roots, leaves, and seeds. Later studies tested only the bud, and found that it actually contains 3 times less tar than tobacco. Many tobacco smokers smoke as many as 25 cigarettes a day. A light marijuana smoker might smoke a marijuana joint once every couple of weeks. A heavy user might smoke one joint a day. Marijuana is safer than tobacco. Weed can actually benefit the lungs in some ways. It is an expectorant, which means it helps remove mucus and other materials from the lungs. In addition to this, marijuana dilates the air channels. This gives it the ability to remove smog and other pollutants from the lungs. People who smoke tobacco and weed live an average of 7 years longer than just tobacco smokers. A major concern is that marijuana could cause cancer because it contains some carcinogens. However, a new study done by the University of California has shown marijuana has no link to cancer. The main active chemical in marijuana, THC, has been proven to kill aging and mutating cells and thus preventing cells from becoming cancerous. If a user feels it is not worth the risk of lung damage, they have several other options. A water bong can be used to cool the smoke and filter out many unwanted chemicals from the plant. Another way is to use a vaporizer. A vaporizer heats the marijuana to a certain temperature where only the THC is vaporized, and when a user inhales it they are getting a pure THC vapor and no other plant constituent. The best option for someone trying to avoid lung damage is to consume it orally. The marijuana is cooked into an oil, fat, or alcohol so that it can be absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. This is a sure proof method for avoiding lung damage.

How does marijuana affect hormones?
It is commonly believed that marijuana causes testosterone levels to drop in men. However, this is not true. In 1974, Dr. R.C. Kolodony reported lower testosterone in men who smoke marijuana. A newer study done by Dr. Robert Block from the University of Iowa found that the use of marijuana, even heavy use, has absolutely no effect on testosterone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, prolactin, or cortisol in men or women. Six other studies also failed to show that marijuana lowers testosterone.

What does it do to the immune system?
Another misconception about marijuana is that it harms the immune system. This myth is based on studies where lab rodents were given doses of THC that were about one thousand times the dose needed for psychoactive effects in humans, every day. This is far too high of a dose, and not an accurate reflection to compare it with an average marijuana user. In 30 days, the animals were back to normal again. No study has ever shown an increase in bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection in marijuana users. In fact, three large studies done in the 1970’s in Jamaica, Costa Rica and Greece have found no difference in disease susceptibility for marijuana users. A study done in 1978 and a study done in 1988 both showed that marijuana can actually stimulate the immune system.

The gateway theory. Does marijuana lead to harder drugs?
Many critics of marijuana will argue that even if it isn’t harmful to your health, it is a gateway drug and will lead to the use of harder drugs such as cocaine and heroin. 
[quote=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_info14.shtml] A real world
example of what happens when marijuana is readily available can be
found in Holland.  The Dutch partially legalized marijuana in the
1970s.  Since then, hard drug use -- heroin and cocaine -- have
DECLINED substantially.  If marijuana really were a gateway drug,
one would have expected use of hard drugs to have gone up, not
down.  This apparent &quot;negative gateway&quot; effect has also been
observed in the United States.  Studies done in the early 1970s
showed a negative correlation between use of marijuana and use of
alcohol.  A 1993 Rand Corporation study that compared drug use in
states that had decriminalized marijuana versus those that had not,
found that where marijuana was more available -- the states that
had decriminalized -- hard drug abuse as measured by emergency room
episodes decreased.  In short, what science and actual experience
tell us is that marijuana tends to substitute for the much more
dangerous hard drugs like alcohol, cocaine, and heroin.
[/quote]
There have been no relationships between the patterns of marijuana and the use of other drugs over time. For instance, in the 1960’s and 1970’s marijuana use increased a lot, but heroin use decreased. 

Can you overdose? How many people have died directly from marijuana?
No one in recorded history has ever died from marijuana.

I would be happy to debate any other health information you have. For now I&#39;ll get onto some more reasons to legalize it.

Drug prohibition causes more crime. If drugs were legalized and regulated, violent drug gangs couldn&#39;t exist, they wouldn&#39;t be able to make money. 
If marijuana was legalized, it could be taxed and regulated. The government could make a lot of profit. It would be higher quality and more pure compared to street drugs, thus reducing some of the harms. Laws could be put into place about driving high, or doing it in public. And also lets face it, the law doesn&#39;t influence your descision if your going to smoke it or not, so not everyone is going to suddenly become a stoner if it was legalized. If you were against it before, you will still be against it after.

How about medical marijuana? I&#39;ll keep this short. But if not for recreational users, it needs to be legalized for medical purposes. 

Marijuana is a very effective medicine for a wide range of illnesses with very few side effects. It is beneficial to cancer patients in several ways. It helps with the pain and nausea generally associated with cancer, but it is generally used to help combat the nausea and other negative effects caused from chemotherapy. It also stimulates the appetite, which is useful because cancer patients often develop anorexia, the loss of appetite or desire to eat. If a cancer patient is not comfortable with smoking marijuana, they can take the prescription pill Marinol, which is a pill that can be consumed orally and contains THC. And because of the growing evidence of marijuana killing potential cancer cells, it could help in other ways as well.

Marijuana is useful for treating AIDS for many of the same reasons as cancer. AIDS can cause extreme nausea, and marijuana is very effective for curing this. AIDS will also cause a severe loss of appetite. AIDS patients are known to literally waste away, sometimes losing hundreds of pounds. Marijuana will help them eat better and improve their quality of life and even help them live longer.

Another condition that marijuana can help treat is glaucoma, a disease characterized by excessive fluid pressure within the eyeball. Glaucoma can cause severe eye and head pain and nausea and vomiting. Marijuana is good for treating these symptoms, but the reason marijuana is best for treating glaucoma is because it lowers intraocular pressure in the eyeball.

Marijuana has many other medicinal benefits as well. It helps reduce inflammation so if something is swollen, marijuana can help treat it as well as reduce the pain. It can be used to treat many more illnesses such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn&#39;s disease, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, the common cold, the flu, and many more. It also helps reduce stress.

Why is alcohol legal, and marijuana not? Alcohol is far more dangerous. http://www.saferchoice.org/content/view/24/53/

Lastly, who the hell thinks they have the right to tell me what I can or cannot do in my own home.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>Probably not. But that post I made was basically a bunch of shit from erowid etc. I made it back when I was all like “yeaah smoke pot for lyfe” and thought pot activism was cool or something.</p>
<p>Rightfully it should be legalized. But hey, being able to water some plants and get rich for it? Keep it illegal please.</p>
<p>It’s too bad though. Instead of using drug money for services that could help us, we’re giving it to organized crime instead.</p>

<p>[quote]<br>
By legalizing this drug, the government would save the money it currently spends fighting the war on marijuana. The federal government spends $19.2 billion every year in fighting the war on drugs; state governments combined spend $77.8 billion every year in this effort. Conservatively estimated, 20 percent of the government’s war on drugs expenditures goes toward marijuana. Assuming that Washington state spends one-fiftieth of the states’ combined expenditure, this means we spend somewhere around $300 million to fight marijuana.[/quote]<br>

<p>If they did legalize it though it would cause more DUI’s which costs the government even more money for them to keep inmates in jail. However I don’t know about the drug enough to get into a big debate about it.[/quote]They could tax the fuck out of it, even more then tobacco.

</aside>
<p>I don’t think you can necessarily say that this is true. I think we assume that if it were legalized, more people would smoke. But if you want to smoke marijuana, it being illegal doesn’t really stop you. It’s easier for a teenager to get marijuana than to get beer and cigarettes, because the drug dealer on the street corner doesn’t care how old you are, if you’ve got the money you get the drugs. If it were regulated I feel the number of users would actually go down (in the long run).</p>
<p>However, this is mostly speculation. But I think it’s interesting.</p>

<p>Edit, Or I may be wrong, apparently the government spends more money trying to fight the war on marijuana war. If they legalized the drug the government would save more money.</p>
<blockquote>By legalizing this drug, the government would save the money it currently spends fighting the war on marijuana. The federal government spends $19.2 billion every year in fighting the war on drugs; state governments combined spend $77.8 billion every year in this effort. Conservatively estimated, 20 percent of the government's war on drugs expenditures goes toward marijuana. Assuming that Washington state spends one-fiftieth of the states' combined expenditure, this means we spend somewhere around $300 million to fight marijuana.</blockquote>

I didn’t realize how much of a crime it is to laugh, munch, and be fascinated at how the fuck a remote works. Oh but we’ll let people drink alcohol, be an abusive drunk, get pissed for no apparent reason, and endanger the lives of others. But of course, it’s all about control and being responsible. But as long as you’ve lived you have never heard of a person abusing the use of marijuana. You can smoke as much as you want and all it’s gonna do is make you talk to your dog for 3 hours and clean our your refrigerator.</p>

They should lift the ban on all drugs and just have extremely strict laws, like for cocaine and hard shit you can only consume it in your own house and nowhere else, breaking the law would result in like 10years+ in jail or like 1,000,000 fine.</p>

<p>Okay, I won’t be so ignorant this time. You definitely got me on the dates knowledge. Nevertheless, I stand by prohibition being entirely different, and just as inapplicable. Alcohol has always been consumed in greater quantities than cannabis. Whether it will continue… ehh I’m pretty sure it will. Still, you never know.[/quote]<br>
I wasn’t meaning to reference the 1920’s prohibition of alcohol, just that the act of prohibiting in general (in my opinion) does not work.</p>
