    <description>[center][size=16pt]         Mobile Devices Section[/size][/center]

[center][size=10pt]This section would obviously be for posting anything that has to do with any sort of mobile device such as iPhones, Androids, Kindles, Tablets, iPads, Jailbreaking, etc..[/size]
[size=10pt]Im sure a mass majoirty of this community has some sort of Mobile Device so this could be a useful section on the forums, but then I am sure people probably think its pretty stupid. I was then thinking if this suggestion was popular and well supported then I suggest a possible badge for this section for users who are very knowledgebale in the Mobile Device Industry or if they are great in developing Applications or Jailbreak Tweaks![/size][/center]

Overall, I can’t see there being nearly enough interest to warrant the introduction of a mobile devices board. I’ve seen maybe 2-3 threads in the past month pertaining to jailbreaking or mobile phones as a general topic.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah that seems to be true but I was just giving it a shot lol.
