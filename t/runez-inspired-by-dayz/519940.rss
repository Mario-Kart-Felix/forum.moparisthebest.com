    <description>[U][B][CENTER][SIZE=4][FONT=Arial Black]Just giving everyone a little sneak peak... there is a LOT more to come[/FONT][/SIZE][/CENTER]

DayZ website: [url=http://www.DayZmod.com]DayZ Mod[/url]

Dayz is a very successful ArmaII mod, based around post-apocalyptic zombie survival. Everywhere is dangerous, you are to survive by going from towns, cities, houses, ports, etc etc collecting loot in order to survive. Your character gets hungry and thirsty, and will die if not treated properly.When you die, you lose EVERYTHING. Now here is where the RuneScape twist comes in. In RuneZ, you use not only loot to survive, but your skills as well. There is no giant bank for your to hold all of your stuff. When you die, you lose everything you have on you. And those items are then available for your killer to take.  Lumbridge Castle is a safe zone for players. There are no shops, minigames, or anything like that. Loot is categorized by location. For example, to find a sword you need to go to a sword shop to check for loot, for a hatchet, you should check a axe shop, for fishing supplies a fishing store. Also, the world is filled with zombies varying in level. The higher the level, the tougher, but better loot on kill. The bigger the city/ the better the loot, the more zombies there will be. Good luck. 



[SIZE=4]List of notes of ideas I made, in no particular order[/SIZE]

[CODE]- zombies everywhere
- there will be small patches and groups of survivors, some will sell you things and some may have quests, some may be hostile
- the wilderness has revs
- lumbridge castle is a safe zone, no attacking
- player starts with nothing, not able to use a map
- loot is in houses, buildings, banks, stores, etc etc. loot can also be found in &#39;searchable&#39; objects, IE haybales, chests, drawers, cabinets, etc etc
- the type of building will specify the type of loot in that building
- some dungeons will have monsters in them, also rare loot will be found by killing these monsters or getting the randomly spawned loot in the dungeons
- players are given a large amount of run energy, agility will allow players to get into cert
- players have hunger and thirst
- food will replinish hunger, liquids like water, milk, and potions will replenish thirst
- zombies will vary between melee, range, and mage attacks, most will be melee.
- zombies will drop loot, most of which is not that good, however, if a high level zombie is killed, possible chance for good loot.
- player will spawn somewhere near water thats connected to the ocean
- a small short tutorial will greet the player when they&#39;ve first played the game, decided by IP address
- dungeoneering, slayer, and possibly summoning will not be in the game
- construction will be used to craft small things to survive and protect, not for building a POH
- hunter will be very different than real RS
- treasure chests will be rare, and allow the player to use it as a small bank, only a max of 20 items can be stored, and other players can steal items from other&#39;s chests
* I am still deciding if stackable items should be allowed in treasure chests
- hunger and thirst will start out at 50/50. Every ~5 minutes it will drop by 3 [/CODE]

[CENTER][B][SIZE=4]Developer Log[/SIZE][/B][/CENTER]

[CODE]
[LIST]
[*]May 23rd, started the project. Did a lot of planning and research. Also finished a system for controlling loot spawns.
 Now I have to go from building to building placing the spawns.
[*]May 24th, started to work on hunger and thirst, also finished some more loot spawns.
[*]May 24th, Hunger and thirst is now complete. This includes
- Hunger and thirst draining by 3 every 5 minutes
- Food and water increasing hunger and thirst levels
- Player takes damage when hunger and thirst are at 0.
[*]May 25th, I got more zombie combat animations. I also played with zombie bonuses for awhile, seeing what will work best, still working on this. I made the whole world PvP, when you die by anything, you will drop ALL of your items. There is NO protect item prayer and there is NO skulls, you will drop ALL of your items no matter what.
[*]May 25th, I now have it set to where the minimap is blocked out. This will create a sense of &quot;unknown&quot;, as you will have no clue what buildings have items in them and what do not. Also you will not know where monsters are. Finding the rare map (as a loot spawn) and reading it will allow the player to regain the use of the minimap, after reading it, the map will vanish.
[*]May 25th, I have created a system to handle random spawning upon first entering the game, and after death. I currently have about 20 locations. I plan on getting 30 more.
[*]May 25th, added in location identification upon spawn.
[*]May 25th, finished all player spawn locations, also added in a feature where if a player reads a world map, they can now use the minimap.
[*]May 26th, I finished all zombie spawns for Lumbridge
Improved my system for handling how the Hunger and Thirst interfaces were done, implemented even more zombie anims.
Made a lot of tweaks here and there
Made summoning familiar beasts of burdens not require a summoning level, not drain your summoning bar thing, and made it to where when you are killed, you drop a summoning pouch according to the familiar you had with you. This will be mimicking DayZ&#39;s backpack system.
Made some tweaks to the items on death system.
[*]May 26th, did misc. updates and tweaks.
[*]May 27th, finished lumbridge %100, played around with a lot of ideas for awhile, and tweaked some drops.
[*]May 28th, moved on to Al Kharid, added in water skins feature. Water skins will save you from losing thirst all across the world.
[*]May 29th, I have now finished all of the Al Kharid loot spawns. I have also added over 100 items to the loot spawn tables, as well as create more loot spawn tables. I have also decided that in Falador, Varrock, and Al Kharid, in their &quot;palaces&quot; there will be rare, but really good loot specific to that city. For example, a Rune Scimitar (currently not found anywhere else) can be found in the Al Kharid palace. It is pretty rare, but not too rare.
[*]May 30th, finished Varrock item spawns and zombies spawns
I&#39;d also like to talk about the zombies in general.
- ALL zombies will only have 300 hp
- ALL zombies have hardly any defense bonuses
- A zombie&#39;s max hit is its combat level. So a level 53 zombie&#39;s max hit is a 53.
* Zombies are not meant to be tough to kill, how ever, there is a lot of them, and when they start to gang rape you, you are in trouble.
[*]May 30th, completed draynor zombie spawns and item spawns.
[*]May 31st, finished edgeville, barbarian village, drawven mines (top and bottom), the rest of varrock, and Falador item spawns. I also tweaked with item spawns a little bit and disabled all objects (such as the gate to Taverley) that let you out of the f2p map.
[*]June 2nd,I have no finished all item spawns for the entire world (except wilderness).
[*]June 3rd, Treasure chests are complete! Major thanks to Stacx, could not have done it without him! Go to page 16 to figure out more information about treasure chests! Also added in purple sweets and im redoing some of the item spawn tables.
[*]June 4th, finished all zombie and item spawns! Now tweaking with a lot of random stuff.
[*]June 5th, fixed some glitches that I&#39;ve noticed, working on a lot of small stuff here and there. Friday is looking pretty good.
[*] June 6th, decided to stop updating the developer log because I am pumping out lots of updates and this isn&#39;t worth updating everytime i finish an update. We will probably be online Friday (June 7th) for beta testing

[SIZE=4]About Me
I&#39;ve been around RSPS for over 5 years. I have led my past 3 servers to become very successful and popular, all 3 have reached the 100+ players online mark, and one has reached a 175+ players online mark. I am an expert when it comes to managing a player base, advertising, and producing a server. I like to work alone on developing, but a good IRL friend of mine works with me on managing the servers and website work. This server may not be the first &#39;survival&#39; like project, but unlike most other developers out there, I turn my projects into successful servers with high amounts of players. I am making this server because I loved DayZ, and this community needs a better variety of servers. We have the tools and skills to make some very unique and fun servers, but all I see is the same server, just different revision. We need less &quot;runescape copies&quot; and more exciting game content, which is exactly what I am trying to do. Thanks for reading. [/SIZE]

Aww not another zombie based game/server/etc/etc lol, we’ve got too many. However, in servers, this is an exception. From what I’ve seen so far it’s extremely well thought out. I love it.<br>
[/quote]<br>
There’s like 2 of such server’s.<br>
ScapeZ (shutdown)<br>
RuneZ (being hacked by it’s own admin’s and mods…)[/quote]<br>
And theirs also 200 2006 remakes, and 500 PI’s loading the latest content. Difference? Not really, it’s this way with every type of game server. Whether it be Garry’s Mod, RSPS, or WoW servers, chances are your ideas are already going to be taken.</p>
<p>There’s ways to make yours rise above all others.</p>
<ol>
<li>Makes yours run better, and look better. No just in-game, but how your advertisements, forums, etc. look.</li>
<li>Have a good community. A good community fixes everything. Fun, nice player base with caring staff will make your community rise above all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Real Non-gameserver example: Mopar and R-S. Mopar get’s one of these right (I think it’s quite obvious which one), and R-S gets neither right.</p>

              <p>Edit : This server is an awesome idea, and I was really enjoying it. However there is one huge problem : Donator / sponsor status. If you have this, then you do not loose your items or stats when you die, which totally takes the fun out of the game. Also, you can buy items from the Zcoins shop for money… Classic example of making an awesome server, then ruining it with too much “donator” BS.</p>
