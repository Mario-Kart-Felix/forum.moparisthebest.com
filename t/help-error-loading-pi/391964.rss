    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-error-loading-pi/391964</link>
    <description>Ok so the client works for me but dose NOT work for others. I have tried to change all the ip&#39;s on the client to mine all = Error loading...Please Report
Next i tryed to change the cache becuase it said in the cmd when i ran the client that there was an problem the the cache download (ALL TESTED ON LAPTOP). So i took the cache, took all the contents and placed them in a .zip, uploaded to fileden.com, put the cache link in the client like so [PI] (located in Cachedownloader.java) [code]	private final int VERSION = 1; // Version of cache
	//private String cacheLink = &quot;http://uppit.com/28ue3guj7atk/CPS.zip&quot;; // Link to cache
	private String cacheLink = &quot;http://www.fileden.com/files/2011/4/6/3110129//cache.zip&quot;; // Link to cache[/code]
There was also a code that had a cache link in it in client.java and heres that code [code]                drawLoadingText(0, &quot;Connecting to File Server...&quot;);
                new Update(&quot;http://www.fileden.com/files/2011/4/6/3110129//cache.zip&quot;, &quot;cache.zip&quot;, signlink.findcachedir());
                  abyte0 = decompressors[0].decompress(i);
			}
        } catch (E[/code] ...Save...Compile...Run all = Error Loading... Please Report.
I jared and signed it correctly then i added a .bat to go along with it to test for errors. When i Clicked on Run.bat it said...[code]Java.ip.FileNotFoundException: C:\CruelalityXV2.0\Maps\mapconfig.txt[/code] From there i delted the whole cache off my computer and tryed it again and i got the same error.. (dosnt say this error anymore but people still cant connect

To let everyone know i am portforwarded and i have tryed to google this. ( i also cannot give up this source &amp; client i love it too much)
I have put a lot of work and explaining on what my problem is so i hope you can help thanks soo much...</description>
