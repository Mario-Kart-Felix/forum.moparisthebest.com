I think it&#39;s definitely a step in the right direction for the Catholic Church. &quot;If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?&quot;, he said.</description>

              <p>Miss: Why change the name just because some people think gays are icky? US’ problem with gay marriage has nothing to do with separation of state and church. England, Norway and Iceland all legalized gay marriage despite having an official state religion (Anglican and Protestantism). You don’t need a separation of state and church, but between bigots and state.</p>
<p>Niall: Chic-Fil-A got somewhat unfair treatment. Nobody is calling for boycott of GOP’s sponsors and donators. You can do what you want in US as long as you don’t speak openly about it.</p>

              <p>I think the argument goes both ways really, Do I believe the governments (in particular united states) should openly accept gay couples? Absolutely. I feel that any couple living with each other for a long period of time should get the benefits of a married couple. However I think everyone is going about it the wrong way. Why not just remove the “married” part and make it some sort of legal license. The reason I say this is I know numerous couple my uncle in particular who have been technically “dating” his girlfriend for 20 some years and never been married. I know from experience the government spends plenty of time separating church and state in schools they could simply do it for the marriage part and be done with it. I believe once this was done noone would care if the gays go married or not because it would no longer be recognized by the government.</p>

              <p>As our good friend Bowser Jr pointed out, the new pope is just as homophobic before, but this time he does a few good things for the poor people and everyone swooning over him like he’s the next democratically elected self-proclaimed figure of moral decency and is in such a position at the express wish of the all knowing all powerful creator of the universe and the most ultimate being that ever lived, will live, and is eternal. Wait a minute.</p>

This is not a significant change in the church policies. They still believe that homosexuality is still a sin and that gay people shouldn’t live out their feelings.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Public has a massive misconception about what Christianity, and I think especially Catholics, think about being homosexual. Such as when the CEO of Chic-Fil-A spoke about his belief about homosexuality based on how his religion sees it. The dude wrote it in a Christian magazine and yet people were extremely mad. I highly doubt the guy would deny a homosexual person service at any Chic-Fil-A, yet people were still furious. I’m glad the pope is pointing out that being a homosexual hater is what Christianity is supposed to be about.[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s not like the CEO of Chic-Fil-A was donating to prevent same-sex marriage, it’s not like Chic-Fil-A was donating millions to anti-gay causes, it’s not like Chic-Fil-A were donating to gay “conversion-therapies”.</p>
<p>Oh wait, they did all of those things. They donated millions to prevent a civil right to same-sex couples, they donated millions to gay conversion-therapies,  such therapies are said to violate human rights.</p>
<p>If corporations want to be treated like people, then they shouldn’t get their panties in a fucking twist when their actions are criticised for being bigoted, homophobic and downright evil. People weren’t mad at Chic-Fil-A because the CEO is an asshat, they were mad because he’s an asshat at the head of a nation-wide organisation that actively promotes initiatives that are against civil rights. Chic-Fil-A donated hundreds and thousands to an organisation that supported a Uganda bill that would kill same-sex couples for fucks sake.</p>
<p>The CEO didn’t just “write in a Christian magazine”, he didn’t just “spoke about his belief”, he as the CEO of Chic-Fil-A is directly responsible for spending millions on infringing civil rights, infringing on human rights, and for supporting legislation in Uganda that would execute same-sex couples.</p>
<p>You know why people are so outraged over Chic-Fil-A and supposed Christians over the matter? It’s because Chic-Fil-A’s most profitable days come from PROTESTS AGAINST PRO-HUMAN RIGHTS PROTESTS. It’s not a matter of Liberals against Conservatives, it’s not a matter of Democrats against Republicans, it’s not a matter of atheists or pro-LGBT against Christians, it’s a matter of an organization donating millions to further human rights abuses and prevent civil rights movements.</p>
<p>The amount of Christians that stand with Chic-Fil-A and don’t have a problem with what they do is absolutely disgusting.</p>

<p>The Catholic church is not pagan. It is the only church with biblical authority. The reformation was not mainly a question about the church’s teaching, but about power in Europe.</p>
<p>Pope Francis does not say it is OK to live as a homosexual, he only says that being gay in it self is not against the church’s teachings. He continues the idea of loving the sinner, hating the sin.</p>

There is a principle to be upheld. If someone is going to talk crap and post things, then act as a hypocrite and go against what he just said, then they need to be called out. Hadyn did nothing to cause Lin to say that, so he is blatantly spamming/flamming.</p>
