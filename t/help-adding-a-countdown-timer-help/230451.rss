    <title>[Help] Adding a Countdown Timer [Help]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-adding-a-countdown-timer-help/230451</link>
    <description>Hi, I just need help adding a countdown timer. I have never really gotten an idea of it, so I just need some help. I was thinking, for a timer were it would count down when atleast 5 players get teleported to a particular area. If you dont really know what im going on about, in Rs when you get teleported to the CastleWars waiting area you have to wait an amount of time. I want that. So please reply as soon as you can with an honest answer, and code  :rolleyes:. This would be greatly appreciated as im releasing a source with a partner not very long from now.

Since I dont want to be spoonfed, please give me answers which would make me learn to do it. Also so I dont get very confused.  :|

You will be given appropriate credits.
Thanks.</description>
