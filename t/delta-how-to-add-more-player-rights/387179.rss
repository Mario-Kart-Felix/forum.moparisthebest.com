Actually there kinda already are more rights. You just have to make functions for them. And possibly change something in the client so they also have crowns next to their name.<br>

ANd, what are you trying to say?[/quote]<br>
I mean that there are already more rights. You just have add options for them. Like, if u make a command for player rights 50, then a player with the rights 50 can use that command. I hope u can understand what I am trying to explain.</p>
