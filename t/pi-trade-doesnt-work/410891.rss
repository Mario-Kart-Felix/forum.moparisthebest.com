    <title>PI - Trade doesn&#39;t work!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-trade-doesnt-work/410891</link>
    <description>Okay so I started this server and worked out all the kinks, but trade doesn&#39;t work!
There is no error in the code because I compile fine. I think it has something to do with player rights, but I can&#39;t find anything about it. Please help!

              <p>It’s probably just that admins can’t trade. A lot of servers have this so that they can’t spawn an item and then give it to a player. I’m not too sure where to change this to be honest. :\</p>
<p>But, I suggest attempting to trade on accounts that do not have spawn rights and see if it works.</p>
