    <title>So long, I&#39;m leaving</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-long-im-leaving/478054</link>
    <description>I know these are not allowed, but its really my time. I&#39;d rather do this and break the rules rather than spamming bad pics everywhere.

I&#39;ve had a good ride along the way with RSPS these two past years. With the Total time logged in: 56 days, 17 hours and 3 minutes I&#39;ve racked in while being a member here, I have learned a lot and matured a lot. 

Will never forget my first year here where I was picking fights left and right and racked in a lot of infractions. Remembering baddy351 and all the stupid things he did. All the stupid things [b]I[/b] did. Just something to look back and laugh at.

For anyone I ever made mad in my past, I am truly sorry. My immaturity was at an all time low during those times, and I regret what I did/ said. 

Special mention to Davidi2 for owning me in all our private arguments. Although he may be annoying as a moderator, he did keep these forums straight. Sad to see you go too David.
Si Force and SilentCJ for being the best two moderators ever, truly love you two.

MITB for finding this amazing community full of smart and bright programmers, along with the &#39;others.&#39;

Rash for banning me on R-S.

The entire google community that I was apart of earlier last year. Had a great time then.

Loveandpower, imsuperman05, and AtomicInt_ for being my best friends along my journey as a programmer. Maybe I will talk to you guys on skype later on.

L__A from R-S who taught me a lot this past month.

Arham for making me laugh at his hideous topic layouts. I think you have lots of potential to contributing to the community apart from what you have so far. You&#39;re only 12, but you have a good possibility of becoming one of the future&#39;s best.

Drub for trying to troll. I think I lol&#39;d at you more for your fails then you actually trolling.[size=1pt] I still beat you at halo 4[/size]

Anyone else I ever worked with.

Thanks SO MUCH for all the good laughs. I had a great time. For all of those who have me added on XBL, I will continue to play Halo during my free time.

I know I have tried to quit before, but this is for real. 1.5 years left in school and a 2.3 GPA. I need to get my shit and life together for college and on. :)

This is my end. This is where I drop programming altogether and finish high school with decent enough grades. Hopefully, I enjoy my future major as much as I enjoyed programming for the last two years.

This is where I say my goodbyes, your sincere friend, 

RiiPiiNFtW

Stuart &lt;-- For those that know me better. 
Thanks! :)</description>

              <p>I know these are not allowed, but its really my time. I’d rather do this and break the rules rather than spamming bad pics everywhere.</p>
<p>I’ve had a good ride along the way with RSPS these two past years. With the Total time logged in: 56 days, 17 hours and 3 minutes I’ve racked in while being a member here, I have learned a lot and matured a lot.</p>
<p>Will never forget my first year here where I was picking fights left and right and racked in a lot of infractions. Remembering baddy351 and all the stupid things he did. All the stupid things <span class="bbcode-b">I</span> did. Just something to look back and laugh at.</p>
<p>For anyone I ever made mad in my past, I am truly sorry. My immaturity was at an all time low during those times, and I regret what I did/ said.</p>
<p>Special mention to Davidi2 for owning me in all our private arguments. Although he may be annoying as a moderator, he did keep these forums straight. Sad to see you go too David.<br>
Si Force and SilentCJ for being the best two moderators ever, truly love you two.</p>
<p>MITB for finding this amazing community full of smart and bright programmers, along with the ‘others.’</p>
<p>Rash for banning me on R-S.</p>
<p>The entire google community that I was apart of earlier last year. Had a great time then.</p>
<p>Loveandpower, imsuperman05, and AtomicInt_ for being my best friends along my journey as a programmer. Maybe I will talk to you guys on skype later on.</p>
<p>L__A from R-S who taught me a lot this past month.</p>
<p>Arham for making me laugh at his hideous topic layouts. I think you have lots of potential to contributing to the community apart from what you have so far. You’re only 12, but you have a good possibility of becoming one of the future’s best.</p>
<p>Drub for trying to troll. I think I lol’d at you more for your fails then you actually trolling.[size=1pt] I still beat you at halo 4[/size]</p>
<p>Anyone else I ever worked with.</p>
<p>Thanks SO MUCH for all the good laughs. I had a great time. For all of those who have me added on XBL, I will continue to play Halo during my free time.</p>
<p>I know I have tried to quit before, but this is for real. 1.5 years left in school and a 2.3 GPA. I need to get my shit and life together for college and on. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>This is my end. This is where I drop programming altogether and finish high school with decent enough grades. Hopefully, I enjoy my future major as much as I enjoyed programming for the last two years.</p>
<p>This is where I say my goodbyes, your sincere friend,</p>
<p>RiiPiiNFtW</p>
<p>Stuart &lt;-- For those that know me better.<br>
Thanks! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
