    <title>Ya, hi there</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ya-hi-there/365502</link>
    <description>I keep getting spammed via emails and msn. 

No I won&#39;t re-open PP2P. I don&#39;t care if Lukes server is going down the drain or if you got banned from it or if hes doing the same thing I did.

No I won&#39;t give you the source. Go download RSCA or something. I deleted my source of my PC a long ass time ago.

I&#39;ve been on and off on these boards and I see a lot of people saying something like &quot;yeah... don&#39;t do what matt did!&quot; How old is everyone here? Apparently younger then 15. yeah, I did make money from it.. But I did keep my community happy, I paid the 204.95$ dedi a month, and other various things. I made updates, minigames, did events... (besides the restarts.. I admit that was stupid and a major mistake. If you ever want to run a successful server, never ever restart the community and hard earned work of peoples characters.)

I know, that 95% of you are going to come in here and be a bit immature about all this and go &#39;go away, nobody cares about you&#39;. I just wanted to say what I think after all these months.

I mean honestly, this community is sad. You all complain about owners making money, and how owners don&#39;t do good on their own server. You just got no idea what it&#39;s like to be constantly harassed by dumb questions and idiotic people. We deserve a little bit of respect and some of that $ our way. We pay the bills, we deserve some income. So yeah, when it comes to Kryptix, good for him, is he making money off it? Good for him. He deserves it cause he works night and day on that server just for YOUR enjoyment. So next time, think about it when you say &quot;arg this server owner is making money of this server, lets hate him and try to shut his server down&quot;

k? thanks.
