    <description>[center][size=24pt]Fast Changes - Huge Results[/size][/center]
[u]
Change or Decrease. [/u]
A huge overhaul of the forum is required if we wish to maintain our presence in the Runescape3/private server scene. It&#39;s no secret that we now rank very low compared to other communities which are now running their own successful servers. Once known as the central hub for development, Mopar has now become a general forum. I fear that if this trend continues, our membership numbers and influence will decrease very soon. 

[u]The Importance of a Backbone[/u]
As it stands, we have very little to offer.  We once had SCAR as our backbone. Villavu have created something nice with SIMBA but unfortunately that means we have lost out. Private servers? Once were a huge draw but now other communities have taken that discovery and expanded on it considerably. Client &#39;hacking&#39;? The sections have become inactive and anyone capable of contributing has left or has lost interest. Our core theme and direction has been lost. We must reconstruct a strong foundation, to allow for the community to reach it&#39;s full potential.
[i]
These are the changes I propose:[/i]

[b]Unification[/b]
Removal of the Gave Development section. We shouldn&#39;t separate a community that&#39;s on the decrease. We should aim to unite the members and then push forward.

[b]Exclusivity to Stroke Egos[/b]
Hide and password protect MITB. This will create some exclusivity. Passwords will be awarded to active members or anyone interested in development. When it seems more like a secret club, individuals will be more motivated to contribute something so that they can gain access. Passwords will be acquired rather easy, if interest is shown over a private message to a staff member.

[b]Fresh Development and Teamwork - Unification of the Scene[/b]
Key staff members of other private server communities should be approached and offered the chance to join a central private server development crew. There will be a proper award to entice them and the crew will be limited to a certain number. Large scale and fresh ideas will be explored and developed upon. Other communities can use anything that is created, as long as credit is given to the crew. This provides free advertising and fits Mopar back into the role of central hub. Files will be hosted on Mopar&#39;s server. As an incentive, mention of their individual servers will not be censored and server list benefits will be provided.

[b]IRC Support[/b]
This one is a no-brainer. Tutorials should be provided on how to connect to the IRC server and an explanation of what it actually is. The official channel should be #moparscape, so no swords are crossed with the long-term members over at #mopar.

[b]Board Re-Structure + A Purpose/Theme[/b]
Inactive sections will be culled and the community will shift focus to becoming a general gaming community, with programming sections and a private server section. This section will not just be limited to RS private servers. Other games with decent private servers will be allowed. Structure will be as follows:
	
[u]General[/u]

[ol][li]Announcements.[/li]
[li]Community General[/li]
[li]Programming/Hacking[/li]
[li]Possible: Graphics[/li][/ol]

[u]Gaming[/u]

[ol][li]General Gaming[/li]
[li]Minecraft[/li]
[li]League of Legends[/li]
[li]Day Z[/li]
[li]Personal Projects[/li]
[li]Runescape[/li][/ol]

[u]Private Servers[/u]

[ol][li]General Private Servers[/li]
[li]Help[/li]
[li][i]Sub-Forum: Tutorials[/i][/li]
[li]Official Crew Projects[/li]
[li]User Projects[/li]
[li][i]Sub-Forum: Advertising[/i][/li][/ol]


[b]Award Changes - Staff Changes[/b]
This will obviously require awards to be removed. As well as this, it should be very difficult to acquire an award/cup of any sort. Each individual section should have one or two sectional mods who are responsible for the content and encouragement of new ideas. They shall be held accountable by global moderators (once again, a decrease is required). Specific members looking after their specialized sections will allow us to focus more on the content of each individual part, as well as decreasing abuse.

[sub][size=8pt]These are just a few ideas that should be toyed around with. Apologies for the lack of writing style, grammar and possible spelling mistakes. I&#39;m writing like a toddler on speed. It&#39;s 12 A.M and this was a five minute job. I also welcome debate, as long as your arguments provide alternatives. No doubt some idiot will claim that numbers aren&#39;t decreasing. This is more about the feel and longevity of the community.[/size][/sub]

Was told long ago by Taharok that it would be added once some changes were made to forum core settings to allow new mods to be added easily. I’m not sure if he just stopped caring about this site or if is really that busy that he needs a long time to get it done.</p>
<p>Other communities aren’t concerned with the amount of work on moderators it may take to keep certain sections of the site running smoothly. Would something like a marketplace cause a lot of issues? Sure. Would it also bring in a lot of users who would like to buy/sell their rsps related things? Yes. The staff should be thinking of ways to attract new users even if they will take a lot of work on the moderators part. I’m not saying that a marketplace is the key thing to add, it’s just an example of something that people could take advantage of. Moderators just seem to complain when an idea is suggested that would require a lot of work on the moderator side but would help out the users or the users would like/use the addition. Mods have lives, I know, but you could just promote some active users as sectional moderators.</p>
<p>I agree with you on a lot of things, Tree. Boards could use some restructuring and reorganizing. This community is more aimed at appealing to the people who have been here for years or in the rsps communities for years. We should be working to attract people who won’t register, post a help topic, and then never come back until they have another help question.</p>
<p>Also, I’m with you on the irc stuff. I don’t spend a lot of time in it, but I’m pretty sure newer users don’t use it much. That could be a reason for a forum chatbox. No one ever likes that idea, though, so it’s never going to happen.</p>
<p>I don’t feel I have the solution to attract a new era of active posters and users but hopefully someone does and they suggest a game changing idea or ideas. We really aren’t offering much other than the server help section to new users. Tutorials and snippets on here can be found on all the other rsps sites. The only difference is that r-s has a lot more tutorials and snippets. If I was going to look for useful tutorials/snippets, I wouldn’t use this site <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>I’m done now with wherever the hell I was going with this post.</p>

<p>it’s taken this long for you guys to realize that the Tutorial Author badge was a pointless update?</p>
<p>It would be great if we saw a over haul of the wiki, some features currently don’t work correctly making it harder to do things and keep an eye on things. It would also be great if we saw an increase in contributions I thank many members of this community for what we have so far on the protocol, but it would be great to get ideas on how we could restructure the wiki and make it easier for those who wish to access the information.</p>
<p>I do have to agree that expanding sectional moderators to help keep active areas of the forums under control, but like any system it’s a double-edged sword. With the increase of moderators it will help make it so no one has to take on a lot of reports alone, but also moderators shouldn’t be forced to go out and check over ever single thread for people who break the rules. It’s important that people report any posts that they believe are breaking the rules so that moderators can then go over it and decide if any punishment should be handed out.</p>

<p>Great read, I’m glad someone has addressed this problem with solutions. I’m in full support. As for the ego stroking, I think making flashy badges and titles should suffice, maybe a hidden section, but locking down all of MITB is a bit of an overkill don’t you think?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We should try to avoid the saturation of awards. They’re something special and should be treated as such. We have to remember that the member base is young and at that age, they love to view those wiser as role models and tend to want to emulate them. The awards give them a goal to reach for, increasing contribution. This goes for all ages really, not just the younger.</p>
<p>[quote=“Si Force, post:8, topic:529515”]I can’t really see how making Moparisthebest an exclusive club will attract new members. Sure, there’ll be curiosity, but the website doesn’t have anything to offer that would warrant making it exclusive. I wouldn’t be particularly pushed to join an exclusive forum just to have a chat. There needs to be a draw.</p>
<p>Your idea reminds me of the vet and CM ranks - they’re both exclusive, but they only grant access to additional boards where you can talk. Although you obviously get access to some interesting information at the same time.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@IRC</span>, There is a guide for that in the announcements section, however I’m not so sure that a lot of people know it’s there. I haven’t used the IRC CHAT button recently, but I think that it sends users directly to the <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> channel. I always would have assumed that for Moparscape users they would have gone to <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span>. It’d also help if the current IRC users didn’t redirect a user asking for help to <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>, although doing that now is punishable.</p>
<p>I’m not really sure how I feel about the board restructure that you have suggested, so I’ll withhold my opinion on that for now. :)[/quote]</p>
<p>I think the most lacking part of the community is now the Runescape cheating. That’s client hacking and all of that jazz. It’s so lacking that it’s worth trying something a little on the extreme side, to see if a positive result can be found. <span class="bbcode-b">Nobody</span> loses out if the community was locked down.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nobody seeks the information over there anymore. If they do, passwords to those members will be provided upon request. There’s no big application to submit or 5 mile run to face. If the information is desired, it shall be handed over. There is no consequence of loss if this was to be implemented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The main purpose is to make sure that the dead side of our community is hidden. Nobody wants to sail on a sinking ship. The stronger and more unified we seem, the better. With this solution, we turn a loss into an exclusive club. It’s more an illusion though, as gaining a password is rather easy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:9, topic:529515”]I disagree with most of this. You can’t just completely change the direction of the site and expect users that are interested in it to appear out of nowhere when there are already large sites dedicated to those things. What will draw those members to moparscape? (also, why the hell does dayz have a board)</p>
<p>Things I do agree with:<br>
pruning RSC from the site or at least putting it into one board<br>
merging a lot of the shit boards that have been recently added<br>
merging minecraft into one board</p>
<p>However, I had a different idea for the staff changes a while back.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">The problem:</span><br>
Lack of moderation in some sections. Staff position viewed  (and in some cases actually treated) as an award instead of a volunteer position.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Proposed solution:</span><br>
Migrate to a more sectional moderator based system. No visible award except in section. Able to warn and moderate  users. Much larger number, probably 1-5 <span class="bbcode-i">per section</span> depending on the sections activity.<br>
Very small number of global moderators (probably &lt; 5). Deal with the occasional forum spammer, people that really need mutes, etc. I personally feel like this number of admins (3-4) is fine.<br>
All staff are required to be active or they should step down, but they can easily return if they feel like being active again.<br>
Staff discussions are more open with the community to increase the marketplace of ideas. This works well with the community suggestions board. Sectionals would not have access to ‘staff’ discussions, and have hardly any more weight in the public ones than a normal user. Of course staff (globals/admins) still make the final call and have their own private discussions as well.</p>
<p>Sectional moderator can be an opt-in position. You remove almost all of the ‘perks’ and it seems more like a volunteer job instead of an award, so the people that apply are the ones that actually want to help, rather than ones that want the awards.<br>
I’ve always agreed with MITB that having inactive staff doesn’t <span class="bbcode-i">hurt</span> the forum, but it does change the whole dynamic of the staff team if it appears like you ‘earn’ a staff position and then you don’t have to actually do anything once you get it.[/quote]</p>
<p>DayZ is rather popular at the moment. There’s a huge number of players here, which even surprised me. Of course, the individual forums can be changed and shifted depending on what game is popular. It’s important to keep current. If there’s demand for another game to be featured and one of the individual sections becomes empty, it would be an excellent idea to replace it.  We must shift and change to keep in touch with the user base.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that people are already interested in the new proposed direction. The General forum is hugely popular, gaming is something majority of us share and private servers of all types are still popular. We’ve just simplified. We’ve removed the bloat, yet given a stronger foundation for the community to prosper. (if these changes were to be implemented.)</p>
<p>Moderation will also be a lot easier with less parts to scout over and the accountability that my staff shake up produces.</p>
<p>[quote=“sinisoul, post:10, topic:529515”]I think you’re a tad bit out of touch why R-S has more members than us in terms of RSPS.</p>
<p>I agree with the awards bit. I’m a tiny bit ticked off that some minor awards have just been given out for tiny things that almost anyone can do without much effort. Although each admin has their own preference as to why someone deserves an award, I think it’s a bit shitty when I think they are just given out to kinda mark them as the people to go to for new members. The standards need to be WAY higher, and you guys need to address the difference between RSPS development/research and java. This was a topic of conversation like a year ago.</p>
<p>I disagree with the MITB password bit. I still visit there to laugh and I actually found a very sweet deob platform that I plan on using. I think that the same information should be available to all members. If you are a new member and never visited there, go have a few laughs as you browse through the topics. That entire forum should be archived.</p>
<p>Most moderators are out of touch with development. I agree with that, the thing is that most of us who are in touch are way too scumbaggy to be mods. But their job isn’t to propel development their job is to help upkeep the forum. So I don’t agree exactly but I’d enjoy if a moderator was on par with me or some of the other knowledgeable developers. Because I mean we could have cool conversations ya know? Just saying. Most of the people who really cared about client hacking are gone anyway.[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I agree that awards should be a lot more difficult to acquire. Excellent point on how there needs to be separation of programming awards and private server related awards. These cups need to be special again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Passwords will be given to those who request with very little hurdles to jump over. We’re dealing illusions, ideas of exclusivity, demand due to lack of supply and removing the parts of the forum that seems dead. We’re calling a loss a gain in a way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[quote=“Loveandpower, post:11, topic:529515”]For the most part I can see your thoughts and why you think they are right. I do have to say though that a couple of the points to me at least kind of contradict themselves… I.e.</p>
<p>Moderators already complain about too many reports/things they have to do / claim they need more moderators. Why would only one-two sectionals be needed then? There would need to be more than that.</p>
<p>As far as I know ( somebody correct me if wrong ) mopar was created for runescape hacking overall. I agree SCAR/SIMBA should be brought back or a similarity but the question then becomes HOW.</p>
<p>When I ran my community about a year and a half ago the only two “java gurus” we had were required to actually write development tutorials or tutorials on certain functions.</p>
<p>I believe all badges should come with responsibilities. I.e. mods have to moderate, admins have to administrate and over look the work of the moderators. A java guru would write that, explanatory and user friendly documentation for java, same with c# gurus and etc. Web developers would write web content and make it user friendly.</p>
<p>I’m not saying there aren’t related documentation already, but a lot of it can be improved upon and also needs to still have more content added.</p>
<p>To just give an example: We have an array tutorial somebody wrote but it isn’t really “advance” it doesn’t really “teach” it just gives examples ( which are nice, but not enough )</p>
<p>Overall, if we want members who are going to actively learn we have to supply the information for those members to want to learn. Us writing a “half ass” tutorial just isn’t going to cut it.</p>
<p>I do understand it is A LOT of work. However, I also believe that things such as the “server download” list should be updated. What was hot back in 2010/2011? The lists that made it easy for people!</p>
<p>Something else I believe that should be enforced more are rules. Sure, the staff do an amazing job already don’t get me wrong. But just because somebody is a veteran/community member/some sort of badged person. That shouldn’t disqualify them from getting the same treatment as a regular new person. If anything, they should be dealt with harsher cause they been here longer so should know the rules. A good example is a certain guru of ours who had made a topic if I remember correctly stating something around the words of “congrats mopar staff you finally got the balls to warn me” what does that say to you? It tells me veterans get away with too much.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ll address each question in order. Well I’ll try to anyway <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Moderation will be made easier by simplifying the board structure and narrowing in the target of each one. There will be designated sectional mods who are encouraged by global moderators to be active and to help push and encourage ideas/development. They help forge a little sub community almost. So setting up rules and maintaining them will be a lot easier, tailored and listened to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t propose that Simba/SCAR be brought back at all. This was mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This board restructure will allow for more quality contributions because of the way it’s set up with moderation. I agree with the ideas that tutorials should be more solid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’re not a nazi community and we do reward those who make up the core. Alienating the only key members left would be suicide and I don’t encourage this at all.</p>
</li>
</ol>

              <p>For the most part I can see your thoughts and why you think they are right. I do have to say though that a couple of the points to me at least kind of contradict themselves… I.e.</p>
<p>Moderators already complain about too many reports/things they have to do / claim they need more moderators. Why would only one-two sectionals be needed then? There would need to be more than that.</p>
<p>As far as I know ( somebody correct me if wrong ) mopar was created for runescape hacking overall. I agree SCAR/SIMBA should be brought back or a similarity but the question then becomes HOW.</p>
<p>When I ran my community about a year and a half ago the only two “java gurus” we had were required to actually write development tutorials or tutorials on certain functions.</p>
<p>I believe all badges should come with responsibilities. I.e. mods have to moderate, admins have to administrate and over look the work of the moderators. A java guru would write that, explanatory and user friendly documentation for java, same with c# gurus and etc. Web developers would write web content and make it user friendly.</p>
<p>I’m not saying there aren’t related documentation already, but a lot of it can be improved upon and also needs to still have more content added.</p>
<p>To just give an example: We have an array tutorial somebody wrote but it isn’t really “advance” it doesn’t really “teach” it just gives examples ( which are nice, but not enough )</p>
<p>Overall, if we want members who are going to actively learn we have to supply the information for those members to want to learn. Us writing a “half ass” tutorial just isn’t going to cut it.</p>
<p>I do understand it is A LOT of work. However, I also believe that things such as the “server download” list should be updated. What was hot back in 2010/2011? The lists that made it easy for people!</p>
<p>Something else I believe that should be enforced more are rules. Sure, the staff do an amazing job already don’t get me wrong. But just because somebody is a veteran/community member/some sort of badged person. That shouldn’t disqualify them from getting the same treatment as a regular new person. If anything, they should be dealt with harsher cause they been here longer so should know the rules. A good example is a certain guru of ours who had made a topic if I remember correctly stating something around the words of “congrats mopar staff you finally got the balls to warn me” what does that say to you? It tells me veterans get away with too much.</p>

              <p>I think you’re a tad bit out of touch why R-S has more members than us in terms of RSPS.</p>
<p>I agree with the awards bit. I’m a tiny bit ticked off that some minor awards have just been given out for tiny things that almost anyone can do without much effort. Although each admin has their own preference as to why someone deserves an award, I think it’s a bit shitty when I think they are just given out to kinda mark them as the people to go to for new members. The standards need to be WAY higher, and you guys need to address the difference between RSPS development/research and java. This was a topic of conversation like a year ago.</p>
<p>I disagree with the MITB password bit. I still visit there to laugh and I actually found a very sweet deob platform that I plan on using. I think that the same information should be available to all members. If you are a new member and never visited there, go have a few laughs as you browse through the topics. That entire forum should be archived.</p>
<p>Most moderators are out of touch with development. I agree with that, the thing is that most of us who are in touch are way too scumbaggy to be mods. But their job isn’t to propel development their job is to help upkeep the forum. So I don’t agree exactly but I’d enjoy if a moderator was on par with me or some of the other knowledgeable developers. Because I mean we could have cool conversations ya know? Just saying. Most of the people who really cared about client hacking are gone anyway.</p>

              <p>I disagree with most of this. You can’t just completely change the direction of the site and expect users that are interested in it to appear out of nowhere when there are already large sites dedicated to those things. What will draw those members to moparscape? (also, why the hell does dayz have a board)</p>
<p>Things I do agree with:<br>
pruning RSC from the site or at least putting it into one board<br>
merging a lot of the shit boards that have been recently added<br>
merging minecraft into one board</p>
<p>However, I had a different idea for the staff changes a while back.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">The problem:</span><br>
Lack of moderation in some sections. Staff position viewed  (and in some cases actually treated) as an award instead of a volunteer position.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Proposed solution:</span><br>
Migrate to a more sectional moderator based system. No visible award except in section. Able to warn and moderate  users. Much larger number, probably 1-5 <span class="bbcode-i">per section</span> depending on the sections activity.<br>
Very small number of global moderators (probably &lt; 5). Deal with the occasional forum spammer, people that really need mutes, etc. I personally feel like this number of admins (3-4) is fine.<br>
All staff are required to be active or they should step down, but they can easily return if they feel like being active again.<br>
Staff discussions are more open with the community to increase the marketplace of ideas. This works well with the community suggestions board. Sectionals would not have access to ‘staff’ discussions, and have hardly any more weight in the public ones than a normal user. Of course staff (globals/admins) still make the final call and have their own private discussions as well.</p>
<p>Sectional moderator can be an opt-in position. You remove almost all of the ‘perks’ and it seems more like a volunteer job instead of an award, so the people that apply are the ones that actually want to help, rather than ones that want the awards.<br>
I’ve always agreed with MITB that having inactive staff doesn’t <span class="bbcode-i">hurt</span> the forum, but it does change the whole dynamic of the staff team if it appears like you ‘earn’ a staff position and then you don’t have to actually do anything once you get it.</p>

              <p>I can’t really see how making Moparisthebest an exclusive club will attract new members. Sure, there’ll be curiosity, but the website doesn’t have anything to offer that would warrant making it exclusive. I wouldn’t be particularly pushed to join an exclusive forum just to have a chat. There needs to be a draw.</p>
<p>Your idea reminds me of the vet and CM ranks - they’re both exclusive, but they only grant access to additional boards where you can talk. Although you obviously get access to some interesting information at the same time.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@IRC</span>, There is a guide for that in the announcements section, however I’m not so sure that a lot of people know it’s there. I haven’t used the IRC CHAT button recently, but I think that it sends users directly to the <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span> channel. I always would have assumed that for Moparscape users they would have gone to <span class="hashtag">#moparscape</span>. It’d also help if the current IRC users didn’t redirect a user asking for help to <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>, although doing that now is punishable.</p>
<p>I’m not really sure how I feel about the board restructure that you have suggested, so I’ll withhold my opinion on that for now. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
