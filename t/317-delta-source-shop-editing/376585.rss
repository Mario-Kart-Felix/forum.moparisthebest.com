              <p>Change the co-ordinates of the NPC using autospawn.cfg, find the NPC ID and next to there change their X and Y co-ordinate to where you want.</p>
<p>To spend the PK Points at shops you would need to add that into your buyItem method in client.java and assign it to a specific shopID</p>
