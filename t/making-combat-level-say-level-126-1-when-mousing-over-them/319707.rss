    <title>Making combat level say level 126 +1 when mousing over them</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-combat-level-say-level-126-1-when-mousing-over-them/319707</link>
    <description>i was wondering if this could be done

i want to make that donator status give people an extra level to say +1 after what level they are

would anyone know how to do this.

i want this to show the other players what level donator they are from the +number
This should give an idea how strong they are and &quot;tough&quot;

Sorry but idk where to start or even start looking =\</description>

              <p>I know you can make it so on someones level it says +/- the difference… so say your a level126 and you hovver over a level119 it would say Level 119 (-7)</p>
<p>I don’t know how to do it, probably a thread about it somewhere =]</p>
