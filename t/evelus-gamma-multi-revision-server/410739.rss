<p>this is going to be hilarious considering i’ve never actually seen you use C++ before, you’ve either learnt C++ to a good extent in a very short time (it’s a big language compared to Java and C), you’ve barely learnt it yet believe you can get far with minimal knowledge or you’re getting someone else to do the heavy work.</p>

</aside>
<p>you’ve really underestimated the language (C WITH CLASSES! JAVA WITH MANUAL MEMORY MANAGEMENT!!!), the standard api has nothing networking related so you’ll be fucking around with libraries a lot and not to mention C++ is a pretty complex language when you really dive into some of the hackish, dirty shit you can do with it.</p>
<p>tbh, i honestly recommend you don’t even attempt an rs emulator until you’ve had plenty of experience with C++ (i’m talking months &amp; years) and you’re proficient at software design (personal observations, i’ve never seen you flex your software design skills so i’ll assume they don’t exist), you’ll be wasting your time writing something when you’re inexperienced because it’ll inevitably turn out like turd.</p>

</aside>
<p>I say its worth a shot, you have to learn somewhere. I can take the next year if I want; make something interesting. I know what I am getting into, I will just move through it and persistently try and come up with new and better ideas.</p>

<p>My partner is trying to persuade me to come back to Java for what he calls ‘Rapid prototyping’ XD<br>
I swing back and forth, I would like to do it in C++ but I know I don’t have enough knowledge in C++ to do it.</p>

<p>this is going to be hilarious considering i’ve never actually seen you use C++ before, you’ve either learnt C++ to a good extent in a very short time (it’s a big language compared to Java and C), you’ve barely learnt it yet believe you can get far with minimal knowledge or you’re getting someone else to do the heavy work.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t have a time frame and I have to learn it eventually, its not that bad in my opinion I just need to learn the style/libraries. [/quote]<br>
you’ve really underestimated the language (C WITH CLASSES! JAVA WITH MANUAL MEMORY MANAGEMENT!!!), the standard api has nothing networking related so you’ll be fucking around with libraries a lot and not to mention C++ is a pretty complex language when you really dive into some of the hackish, dirty shit you can do with it.</p>
<p>tbh, i honestly recommend you don’t even attempt an rs emulator until you’ve had plenty of experience with C++ (i’m talking months &amp; years) and you’re proficient at software design (personal observations, i’ve never seen you flex your software design skills so i’ll assume they don’t exist), you’ll be wasting your time writing something when you’re inexperienced because it’ll inevitably turn out like turd.</p>

<p>Processes mostly, I am experimenting with some aspects of speed. Things are subject to change but I did have to include that I was working with it. Some calculation that I have to do for say, the palette system take long than I would like; I will compare and if it is any more faster than before I will continue to use JNI. I am focusing on the scripting system right now, because that is more important.</p>
