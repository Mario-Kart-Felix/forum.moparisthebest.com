    <title>Unfortunately i&#39;m poor, but we need a lot of help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unfortunately-im-poor-but-we-need-a-lot-of-help/547238</link>
    <description>Hey guys, so I know you&#39;re gonna criticize me just for this but hear me out. Me and two others are developing an allstar into a REALLY amazing source in an effort to kind of prove allstar CAN be made into something real. Before you laugh, check out our development thread here: [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,665194.0.html]https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,665194.0.html[/url]
A couple notable things we&#39;ve got if you don&#39;t feel like checking out our thread:

[ul][li]Working e-mail system with ::daily bonuses, and a email recovery system all going through the server using javaxmail api.[/li]
[li]Working prayers, with all pvm combat implementing equipment bonuses, defence level, prayer bonuses, etc.[/li]
[li]Working pet cats, with hunger, aging, fatness (e.g. overgrown, normal, etc)[/li]
[li]Near perfect economy with monster drops fairly distributed by a custom coded drops.cfg with working random integer inside of the cfg.[/li]
[li]Fully added gnome drink mixing, and herblore[/li]
[li]Many different walkable areas, near open-world with teleports to specific areas that can be explored to lead to other areas (e.g. ladder in tav dungeon goes up to tav where you can buy basic level herblore supplies from that guy[/li]
[li]Basic questing system (Kaqemeex can show you how to herblore)[/li]
[li]Reasonably integrated customs with corrected animations, bonuses, prices, equips, drop rates, etc.[/li]
[li]Class system in the making to make bossing a little more fun (choose to be a lich, a tank, a cleric, etc. all with their own unique abilities)[/li][/ul]

And there&#39;s so much more! But we really need some help with a lot of stuff. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have any money as i&#39;m out of a job but if you&#39;re interested in being a part of the next big server, here&#39;s your in!

I&#39;ve compiled a small list of items we need fixed that I personally am unable to do. I&#39;m pretty experienced but most of these i&#39;ve just never taught myself how to do and i&#39;m very busy developing all the other aspects of the server! If you&#39;d like to help add my skype at Connor.S68, we would really appreciate any help you can offer with the items below:


-Add highscores
-Add vote4cash
-Add autodonate
-Add Webclient
-Add gameframe switcher in game
-Fix all object models (mith drags in gnome tree, fences, lightsabers in esse mine, etc)
-Fix autocasting
-Fix Ranging
-Fix NPC following (summoning, pets)
-Fix items on death
-Fix which attack style button is selected on relog
-Fix Protect from melee head icon.
-Fix how if you eat at the exact time an NPC hits you, the heal wont be processed.
-Fix sometimes npcs hit twice really fast
-Fix how if in combat with npc and the npc is on top of you, it should walk backwards.
-Fix npc turning to face player when engaged.
-Fix all Juggernaut minigame bugs.
-Fix players will disconnect at random times and won&#39;t be able to log back in as it says &quot;their account is already logged in&quot;</description>

              <p>This is either:<br>
A) Wrong section. Could see this <span class="bbcode-i">maybe</span> being in development teams, if formatted more towards recruiting someone able to fix all or some of said bugs…</p>
<p>B) Not something you post.<br>
The Server Help section is to get help. Not for you to post a “To do” list and ask us to do it for you.<br>
Also, your wallet doesn’t mean shit here, as you’re not allowed to offer money as a reward/donation/payment/whatever.<br>
If you want help, show it. Show you’ve actually tried to look into it. We can’t just magically know what EVERY damn bug in your server is, where in the code it is, and how to solve it.</p>
