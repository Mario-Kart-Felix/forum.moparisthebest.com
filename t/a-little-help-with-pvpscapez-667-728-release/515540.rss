    <title>A little help with PvPscapez 667/728 Release</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-little-help-with-pvpscapez-667-728-release/515540</link>
    <description>i have a few problems with pvpscapez server first a grand exchange problem see the screen shot it works but when i close the buying interface and close ge i still have the search form in my chat window, how to fix that maybe a refresh or something should fix it i am noob with java, second i want to add a heal command, by default this server uses ::hit for random healed damage see the command used now

if (cmd[0].equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;hit&quot;)) {
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
               player.applyHit(new Hit(player, Utils.getRandom(3),
                     HitLook.HEALED_DAMAGE));
         }
its random healed damage and heals so little damage arround 40 hp, i want to add something like this

if (command[0].equals(&quot;heal&quot;)) {
         player.heal(1555);
         player.getSkills().restorePray(120);
      }
but this one always gets me error when compiling so if anyone pro can help to add that command that would be great, the last thing i need is a def editor i tried different ones but i couldn&#39;t make it work</description>
