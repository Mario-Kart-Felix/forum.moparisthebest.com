    <description>About PvP Ownage

Hello, I&#39;m Admin Logic the co-owner of PvP Ownage. 
PvP Ownage was once widely known in 2010 for being a fun 525 server in which you could spawn any item you wanted and go out and pk in PvP Zone. Unfortunately we suffered flood attacks almost every other hour and had no option but to turn the server off. It&#39;s been three years now and we are ready to start new with a 317! PvP Ownage has only been online for about 3 weeks now which was spent making major changes and planning the future of PvP Ownage. Here are a few changes and added features done by the owner (Soxcalibeast):
