    <title>Login Error T2 - 97,79,126 - 2,0,0 - 31,-59,</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/login-error-t2-97-79-126-2-0-0-31-59/111570</link>
    <description>Edit: I have found the error! It is in my menu&#39;s for some reason they were messing up the login stuff

Ok I was editing my fr33sc4p3 server today and it was working fine untill I tried to change my pass by typing ::pass.  It said my password was reset but when I logged out I couldn&#39;t log in anymore. So I deleted my character in the Character, Moreinfo, and Saved Games folder and tried to log back in. That is when I got the T2 - 97,79,126 - 2,0,0 - 31,-59, error in Moparscape.  So I tried a different account and got the same thing. The same error happened in Endar so that is why I&#39;m posting in this section not moparscape questions.  Has anybody ever gotten this error before? If so, do you know how to fix it?

Thanks in advance,

              <p>Because the passwords are encrypted…By doing ::pass NEWPASS it rewrited in letters instead of encrypted in #'s, you have to get the # back or start a new account</p>
