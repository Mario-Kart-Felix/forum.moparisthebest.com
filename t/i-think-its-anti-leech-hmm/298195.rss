    <title>I think its anti-leech.. hmm</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-think-its-anti-leech-hmm/298195</link>
    <description>Yeah uhm, I recently dled the MithScape source and ive been trying to add full boss minigames, gwd, clanchat, and finish the BH that was started there as a base. But, it has anti leech, so I cant really change anything... Does anyone know how to disable it? I will give mod for it on my server, it has about 10-15 people at all times.. Thanks :)</description>

<p>Make sure you’re compiling and running the same files. I never even seen “mithscape” but if it has src and compiled files seperately, then make sure they are updated.</p>

              <p>He must have put that anti-leech there because he doesn’t want people to just change name and then host it.<br>
If you know how to do the stuff you mentioned, then you should know how to fix that anti-leech.</p>
