    <description>My shops do not work.
I can get the npc to spawn, even talk to to trade, but then there&#39;s the problem that the items won&#39;t show up in the shop!
I have tried redoing all the codes, and i have followed tuts exactly, and still the shop is blank with no items. I have tried reloading the source (WinterLove v.3) and still no luck, I have done a huge amount of editing, and would rather not have to start over again..
I&#39;m thinking it might be a problem somewhere in code that is not autospawn.cfg, or shops.cfg... I have it placed correctly into client.java.
So maybe the issue is within another file..? Or perhaps in in a weird section of client.java i don&#39;t know? 
I&#39;m pretty sure i need help from a decent coder, or just anyone that also had this problem.
Any suggestions/help highly appreciated!

Thanks so much anyone that can help me!

              <p>Make sure you have items added in item.cfg seems like the most obvious problem. Other than that, I don’t know what the problem is. Good luck and if you could post examples of what you have done, that would help a lot.</p>
