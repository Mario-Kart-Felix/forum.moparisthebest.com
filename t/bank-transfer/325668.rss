    <description>Coon has been helping me with a Money storage system for my server and all it needs is a way to transfer money from 1 char to another..

the money saves as character-vault = #

they type ::add # and it adds the ammount to their vault and removes from inven
they do ::take # and it removes the ammount from their vault and adds to inven
i need a ::send # playername to remove from 1 players vault and into another
