              <p>IF I was in his position? Well let me think… from a psychological standpoint if I was TORTURED. You would eventually go into a protective type of shell so you wouldn’t “care” either way. Yes, you will feel pain, but you will lose all hope so caring if others found out or not wouldn’t matter.</p>
<p>When a teenager/little girl gets kidnapped, is raped for 15 years before one day finally being saved. What was she thinking in the time frame of those 15 years?</p>
<p>1-3 years most likely she was thinking oh god somebody please help me!</p>
<p>5-6 years there has to be someone…anybody…</p>
<p>7-10 years I just wish this would end now</p>

So, what if this were to happen to you? What if you were a Gitmo prisoner? Would you want nobody to know, care, or even fathom what happens to you? Your an idiot and a hypocrite.</p>
<p>This is a REAL situation, how are they suppose to protest other then a hunger strike? Are they suppose to fight armed solders with their bare hands? Or scream at them until they finally shut them up? This is the only way that they can get any true attention.</p>
