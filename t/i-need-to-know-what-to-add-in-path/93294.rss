    <title>I need to know what to add in PATH</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-to-know-what-to-add-in-path/93294</link>
    <description>Ok I am currently making a whole ne online game mixing: Baldur&#39;s Gate, RuneScape (a little), World of  Warcraft, NeverWinter Nights. But i wont let you into it until I post it in the Development section

Any-way i need to know what to add in my PATH because i accidently deleted it and i cxan&#39;t get my client or server to run because i need it. So, if you could get me what I need to add in PATH I would like it.

TY
