    <title>Attack option only in wilderness? - 317 Delta</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/attack-option-only-in-wilderness-317-delta/384795</link>
    <description>So, I have my server going etc ;)
Basically, players have the attack option, how can I make it so they can only attack in wild?

Please don&#39;t suggest removing that, I already tried, it removes the option everywhere.

Attack thing:
[code=java]outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
outStream.writeByteC(3);		// command slot (does it matter which one?)
outStream.writeByteA(1);		// 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context menu
outStream.writeString(&quot;Attack&quot;);
outStream.endFrameVarSize();[/code]</description>

<p>granted, if he is a beginer at coding mine wasn’t the best filler. i actually found the answer to this question on google for myself the same day ~_~ so its not like he was short of resources, or access, just short of willpower to find the answer.</p>

<p>And have you also checked that the code works at all? Try changing attack to something like spank and see if it changes. If it does then there is no reason that shouldn’t work. Otherwise you need to get some new code/check it is in the right place etc. You need to make sure this is being checked in process or in the walking packet. Better to put it in the walking packet.[/quote]</p>
<p>Like, I had tried something similar earlier, I must have just missed something.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

Basically, players have the attack option, how can I make it so they can only attack in wild?</p>
<p>Please don’t suggest removing that, I already tried, it removes the option everywhere.</p>
<p>Attack thing:</p>
<p><code>outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
outStream.writeByteC(3);		// command slot (does it matter which one?)
outStream.writeByteA(1);		// 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context menu
outStream.writeString("Attack");
outStream.endFrameVarSize();</code></p>
