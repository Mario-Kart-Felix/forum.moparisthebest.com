    <title>Talk-to npc aint working!?!?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/talk-to-npc-aint-working/218264</link>
    <description>the first click npc case aint working for some reason. 
When i click on an npc that worked yesterday and opened a shop, today it wont open it.  Yesterday the wise old man had a dialogue when you talked to him, now today nothing.  And it isn&#39;t the shops with the problem because my shops emote opens up shops for you and they all work.  Something is wrong if anyone has an idea i would greatly appreciate it.</description>

              <p>ya im sure nothing changed in it, idk why it wont work anymore and someone else is having the same problem its not only me.</p>
<p>The beginning looks like dis</p>
<p><code>                                case 155: //first Click npc
				int NPCSlot = (misc.HexToInt(inStream.buffer, 0, packetSize) / 1000);
				int NPCID = server.npcHandler.npcs[NPCSlot].npcType;
                                faceNPC(NPCSlot);
				boolean FishingGo = false;
				boolean PutNPCCoords = false;</code><br>
And after that is all the npcs with shops and stuff.</p>
