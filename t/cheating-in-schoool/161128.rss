I don’t usually cheat but I help my friend who isn’t so good at science. We do multiple choice so he puts his pen down pointing at the question and if I know the answer I put my hand on the table with 1-4 fingers out stretched and he nods when he sees it. It is pretty obvious but we are in a class of ~60 so we get away with it.<br>

              <p>I do cheat, but its not like a look over peoples shoulder thing. I know everyone at my school so if I just ask, I get their sheet right in front of me. I return the favors as well, so yes, I do.</p>

              <p>I have cheated once, and only once. That was in 5th grade when we had to write this retarded report on the Revolutionary War battles. We had to do this bubble chart on the computer, so we could study from it… I didn’t study, and for the first time in my life… Not studying caused me to cheat. All I can say is that I was lucky I had a sub that day. She was an old lady and didn’t watch us much. When she wasn’t looking, I would open my desk (we had those “flip top” desks) a bit and look at the chart. After that test, I wanted to kill myself (not literally). I felt like my “smart-guy rep” had been partially ruined. I vowed that I would never cheat on a test again. And I didn’t. After that little incident, I came up with a test technique to use if I didn’t study. I’d strain my brain hard, and go through what we learned in that chapter or w/e, then I would try to use the stuff I learned as a hint to the answer, or use that to lead to the answer itself. It worked pretty well. I don’t use it often, because usually even 5 minutes of studying for a very big test will suffice for me, and I can usually get an ‘A’ with that little bit… Multiple choice tests I pretty much don’t study for now because I can just use a process of elimination to get the answer easily. Usually anyways.</p>
<p>And btw, yeah, that probably is some sort of SAT practice thing. Notice at the bottom it says colleges will not take that form as proof of your grades or something like that.</p>
