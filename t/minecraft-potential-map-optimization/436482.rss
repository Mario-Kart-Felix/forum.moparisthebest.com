    <title>Minecraft Potential Map Optimization</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/minecraft-potential-map-optimization/436482</link>
    <description>I have just been thinking about a potential map optimization, and if would really be an optimization. I don&#39;t know how the client manages maps (all I know is that they went from the NBT format to Anvil) but thought about one way I would do it.

Since the maps are generated with biomes, then there&#39;s really no need to store all of the blocks by their id. All you would need is to have each chunk (or chunk group) have a palette, and then have each block represent an index in that palette. This could also further be improved by having large areas &quot;mapped&quot; (since most chunks have nothing but air at &gt;= 127, you could just say &quot;AIR everywhere&quot; instead of the traditional way (16 bytes for each block))

What are your thoughts?</description>

<p>Not to my knowledge. If i recall, they write all of the block data, and then compress each region. So if all you had was a 8x8x128 chunk as the map, there would be 8,192 blocks; then it’s a short for the block Id (I read up on the map format) as well as 3 doubles for the location, resulting in 26 bytes per block, resulting in 212KB per chunk (raw). Now, because there is a lot more change on the horizontal plane than the vertical plane, putting the Y-values first in the location improves compression. And then when you take into account the “state” of each block, it seems like it would bloat up rather quickly. Right now, one of the regions of my map is 3MB. It might not sound like a lot, but if you were to add the multiplayer aspect (like MoparCraft) where houses can be found at +/- 8000, 8000, the world would take up a lot of space. And with the new Anvil format supporting height levels of 256, that can add to it.</p>
<p>As for the blocks in the region, neither way seems very good, due to the fact that mods are so prevalent. The only thing i could think of is something like namespaces, and store the block data in definitions in a HashMap</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class Block {
    // ...
}

public static final HashMap&lt;String, Block&gt; BLOCKS = new HashMap&lt;String, Block&gt;();

static {
    BLOCKS.put("minecraft.air", new Block(...));
    BLOCKS.put("mopar.logo", new Block(...));
}</code></pre>
<p>[/quote]<br>
That still doesn’t really explain to me how a palette would be better than what they’re using now.</p>
<p>Also, from the wiki</p>

<p>So, I think it’s safe to say they changed it so there’ s a flag stating whether a layer in a chunk is empty.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ah, I didn’t see that part. That’s good to know.</p>
<p>And with the palette, my idea was that there’s probably not going to be more than 255 different block types in one chunk, so it could reduce the amount of total space necessary.</p>
