<p>A Million Little Pieces is a book by James Frey, originally sold as a memoir and later marketed as a semi-fictional novel following accusations of literary forgery. It tells the story of a 23-year-old alcoholic and drug abuser and how he copes with rehabilitation in a twelve steps-oriented treatment center. While initially promoted as a memoir, it was later discovered that many of the events described in the book never happened.

<p>If you want it to be a true statement, yes, the only option is 2.</p>
<p>But like I’ve said, if it’s anything other than 2, it evaluates as false.</p>
<p>Thus showing that changing a variable can easily change whether something is true or false.</p>

You can easily show this with math, take this equation.</p>
<p>x + 5 = 7</p>
<p>Now, if x is 2, this equation results as true. However, if x is 1, 5+1 is 6, not 7, therefor making it false.</p>
<p>You may be thinking how this shows it, well, like I said in an earlier reply, if you change one of the variables, it can determine whether or not something evaluates as true or false.

I’m not saying that it always changes if a variable changes, but it’s easily possibly for the truth to ‘change’.<br>

<p>Yes but the point I’m trying to get across is that whether or not it evaluates to true or false can rely on variables being changed.</p>

<p>you can safely ignore my argument, just wanted to talk about stinky hooker vaginas in a boring topic.[/quote]<br>
The truth is that you need to pay your hookers more. This will stay the truth forever. Nothing will change the fact that you underpaid your hookers before the 6. of November 2012.</p>

<p>The hooker eventually buys some Vagisil (albeit months later since she only made enough for her crack addiction). Near the end of treatment, the yeast bacteria are in small numbers and her twat doesn’t smell anymore. The same client is back for more. She tells him the truth, “I still have the infection but the smell is gone, now you can DATY”</p>

No, because the idea that you are “ugly”, is an opinion, and cannot be proven fact.</p>
