    <title>How to set how much RAM a server uses</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-set-how-much-ram-a-server-uses/398555</link>
    <description>This is a pretty basic tutorial on how to set how much RAM your server/client uses.

First of find your run.bat or whatever you use to start your server. Right click and click edit. It should have something like this.

Server: [code]@echo off
title Project Insanity
java -Xmx800m -cp bin;deps/poi.jar;deps/mysql.jar;deps/mina.jar;deps/slf4j.jar;deps/slf4j-nop.jar;deps/jython.jar;log4j-1.2.15.jar; server.Server
pause[/code]

Client: [code]@echo off
title Client
java  -Xmx512m Gui 30 0 lowmem members 32
pause
[/code]
It could be a little different depending on your server/client.
Now look for [code]java  -Xmx512m Gui 30 0 lowmem members 32[/code]

The Xmx512m could be different but that is how much reserved RAM your server or client is using. Change that to higher if you want it to run faster or lower it if you want it to use less RAM.

You can also speed up a client by running it then pressing ctrl + alt + del. Click the processes tab and find the javaw process. Right click it and click set priority then higher or lower depending on how much speed you want it to have.

If I missed something or something is incorrect please tell me and I will change it. Thanks</description>

<p>And he didn’t even explain it correctly.</p>
<p>-Xmx512m doesn’t reserve any RAM for the JVM. Nor does increasing the number “speed up” the process. It set’s the <span class="bbcode-b">MAXIMUM</span> amount of RAM that the JVM can allocate for heap space.</p>
