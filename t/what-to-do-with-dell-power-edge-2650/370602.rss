    <title>What to do with Dell Power Edge 2650?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-to-do-with-dell-power-edge-2650/370602</link>
    <description>Okay, well my aunt has given me a Dell Power-edge 2650 because she didn&#39;t need it and was going to trash it because it didn&#39;t have a pci-e 1x port to hook a certain expansion card; so apparently she has money out her ass. Me being sensible offered to take it off her hands, it has the following

Specifications:
Two Intel Xeon 2.4ghz Processors
2GB Memory
2X SCSI 300GB 10,000 RPM Drives
1X SCSI 73GB 10,000 RPM Drive
2X Gigabit Lan Ports
3X PCI-X Slots Backwards Compatible with PCI cards

I am clueless as fuck with what to do with it. I was thinking about selling it and thought I could make a decent amount off it but i&#39;m unsure. I was thinking $300 maybe? I have never evaluated servers for pricing so I don&#39;t know. What do you guys think I should do with it?</description>

</aside>
<p>I took the harddrives out, bubble-raped them and took them on carry on the plane. Shes going to be bringing the server at Christmas. So if you are interested in some SCSI harddrives i have:<br>
2 new 300GB SCSI harddrives 10,000rpm<br>
2 used 73GB SCSI harddrives 10,000rpm<br>
drives</p>
<p>She had me put the 2 new ones in when I got to Nashville but decided she didn’t want the server so I pulled them back out and took it with me.</p>
<p>Some info:<br>
The ones I labeled as new are Worldisk recertified by Fujitsu MXJ3300SC800600X 300GB SCSI drives<br>
The other two are here <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hitachi-Ultrastar-146Z10-IC35L073UCDY10-0-Centronics/dp/B0019MOYYQ" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.amazon.com/Hitachi-Ultrastar-146Z10-IC35L073UCDY10-0-Centronics/dp/B0019MOYYQ</a> they are used (or new) I am not sure if they shipped these new with the server or not.</p>

              <p>It needs some more RAM to make a good server.  Where do you live anyway?  If it’s somewhat close to south-west Ohio I may be interested in buying it from you. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
