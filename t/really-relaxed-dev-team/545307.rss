    <title>Really relaxed dev team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/really-relaxed-dev-team/545307</link>
    <description>Hey guys. So basically. I want to make a dev team for my server. BUT, it&#39;s nothing serious.
What I mean is:
There are no deadlines.
You&#39;re not pressured to finish work.
You don&#39;t have to &quot;Work&quot;. You can code when you feel like it*.

Why?
I find working while stressed just makes things harder than you need it. You also may not do your best work because you were worried about hitting that deadline, instead of making a &#39;flawless&#39; product. This type of team and project will give you not give you just the freedom you need, but the freedom you want as well.

I do have a client and server. I do have my website. I don&#39;t have a VPS, that will be figured out.
My project is a 317 PI. If you&#39;ve ever met me, that&#39;s all I ever use. Yes, I know PI is shit or whatever you want to call it. Yes, I know there are better bases I can use. Yes, you can shut the fu[b][/b]ck up about it now.


I am looking for, at most, 2 more developers.

Here is some content directly from my server.
[url=http://rsps.canyourcode.com/Bank/index.php]Online bank viewer with privacy settings[/url]
[url=http://rsps.canyourcode.com/drops/index.php]Online rare drop viewer, also has privacy settings[/url] I plan on adding more features to this.
[url=http://rsps.canyourcode.com/highscores/]HiScores[/url]

Owners and players that have access to ::master, ::item, and related commands do not show up on the hiscores, as they can boost their exp faster than regular players.

An updated version of this is also added to my server. (I wrote the original, for those that don&#39;t know)

My skype can be found on my profile. Other ways to contact me are via reply, or private message.</description>

Yes, you did write the original source code for it. But I had to do some modifications to patch some possible dupes.</p>

Yes, but the difference is this isn’t like a job. Well, in some minor aspects it is, but not fully.<br>
At a job you get paid an hourly wage. At a job you also have more responsibilities. And it’s a lot more serious.<br>
I just want a project that me and a couple people can work on, and not be too serious about it. Rushing to complete things can make the final product worse than it should be.</p>

I understand completely what you are saying, but there isn’t motivation if there isn’t a goal.</p>

              <p>Hey guys. So basically. I want to make a dev team for my server. BUT, it’s nothing serious.<br>
What I mean is:<br>
There are no deadlines.<br>
You’re not pressured to finish work.<br>
You don’t have to “Work”. You can code when you feel like it*.</p>
<p>Why?<br>
I find working while stressed just makes things harder than you need it. You also may not do your best work because you were worried about hitting that deadline, instead of making a ‘flawless’ product. This type of team and project will give you not give you just the freedom you need, but the freedom you want as well.</p>
<p>I do have a client and server. I do have my website. I don’t have a VPS, that will be figured out.<br>
My project is a 317 PI. If you’ve ever met me, that’s all I ever use. Yes, I know PI is shit or whatever you want to call it. Yes, I know there are better bases I can use. Yes, you can shut the fu<span class="bbcode-b"></span>ck up about it now.</p>
<p>I am looking for, at most, 2 more developers.</p>
<p>Here is some content directly from my server.<br>
<a href="http://rsps.canyourcode.com/Bank/index.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Online bank viewer with privacy settings</a><br>
<a href="http://rsps.canyourcode.com/drops/index.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Online rare drop viewer, also has privacy settings</a> I plan on adding more features to this.<br>
<a href="http://rsps.canyourcode.com/highscores/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HiScores</a></p>
<p>Owners and players that have access to ::master, ::item, and related commands do not show up on the hiscores, as they can boost their exp faster than regular players.</p>
<p>An updated version of this is also added to my server. (I wrote the original, for those that don’t know)<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSVTxU6v86c" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSVTxU6v86c</a></p>
<p>My skype can be found on my profile. Other ways to contact me are via reply, or private message.</p>
