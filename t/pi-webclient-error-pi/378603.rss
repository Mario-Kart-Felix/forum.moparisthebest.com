    <description>Hi, I have a problem with pi webclient. I dont know whats wrong but ill set the cachedownloader, jar and then when i run the client then theres White screen. Usually it must show Downloading cache ... but no... It still downloads cache correctly but i dont have the Download cache and unpacking messages. People told me its Anti-Leech. But how do i fix that? In CacheDownloader.java there was like //drawloadingtext(&quot;Downloadcache...&quot;); Ok ill removed the &quot; // &quot; from all the texts but it still doesnt show?</description>
