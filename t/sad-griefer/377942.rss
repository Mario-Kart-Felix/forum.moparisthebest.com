I will say this: I broke nothing in your house BESIDES the cobblestone, set up moments before. I did not see any chests, and if I did, I would have attempted to loot. If u have chests with passwords, they can’t be destroyed or entered. As Davidi put it before, to those who have no password “find a better hiding place”.[/quote]</p>
<p>If it’s fair for you to kill him, then it’s certainly fair for him to log off before you finish.  However it is against the rules to grief, even if you find something ‘unfair’, so I’m going to ban you for a day so maybe you will learn your lesson.</p>

<p>I didn’t even have doors. As I said before someone griefed my house and I assumed it was you. However, you did break down the cobblestone that was set there. However, the cobblestone has been there for 2 days, I did not add it, you broke it down.</p>
<p>I don’t want you banned but I do want my stuff back.[/quote]</p>
<p>How did u get into the house then?</p>
