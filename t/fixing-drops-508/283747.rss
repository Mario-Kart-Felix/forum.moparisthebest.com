    <title>Fixing drops [508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixing-drops-508/283747</link>
    <description>Hi, I was wondering if anyone knew how to fix drops on a 508 server because right now you add the drops into npcdrops.cfg or w/e its called (BTW this is bulby base but its probly the same for all) and the drops work but they dont show up for the person who killed the monster, it shows up for a random person in the server. So even if you could tell me just the file I could probly figure it out. thanks.</description>
