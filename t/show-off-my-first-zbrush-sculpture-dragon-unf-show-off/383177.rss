    <description>It may be a bit sloppy, it&#39;s my first Zbrush sculpture so be nice. :)

Idk if i&#39;ll ever be finishing it though, depends if im still in the mood

-Note- 
Though this single forehead is 100,000 vertices, and a 7MB save file, i really cant control the smoothness, mainly because you can undo something 5 times and it wont let you undo the 6th time, and i was already sculpting before i realized it was over 100,000 vertices.

all i did was subdivide 2 time O.O There was absolutely NO lag in Zbrush, but in blender, it almost crashed my computer when i opened this.

Hope you like it... Any questions, post below or pm me.</description>

Try to do something more organic like a cat. This will test your skills more than just using the grab tool. I wish I could get some of my sculpter buddies to come here, but sadly I can only contact them through 4chan… They could show you how they redo the topology and make it more user friendly for say a game without using it as just a normal map. Usually it takes them 20 hours to make something worthy of showing. 12 hours for sculpt and 8 hours for topo. They use a method called blocking where you create the primitive shapes in say blender and then export it to ZBrush. Then open up the base and add detail to it. Much easier than using a sphere to create everything.<br>

<p>Eh, yeah… Last time i tried modeling, it felt i was slowly getting worse at it. That’s one reason why i haven’t been posting anything lately.</p>
<p>Lately, i’m like “I feel like modeling something great today, like (ex) a car” and i open up my modeling editing software, and i get stuck at the very first thing i need to do, then i just completely lose my motivation. Mainly because i don’t know what i’m doing about 80% of the time, and i try looking up some tutorials or ask for help but i just don’t seem to understand.</p>
<p>Same thing has been happening when i try sketching, i was better at drawing when i was in high school. now i get stuck, and my drawings are getting worse every time i try practising, which i usually do once or twice a day before i just give up for the day.</p>
<p>I’d like to meet your friends though, i would like some help…[/quote]<br>
I’ll pm you it. They are very helpful and most of them work for major companies. Main person I like and look up to is President of Pixar. He’s the one that made the stuff in sculptris. The minotaur and such. They use a tool called topogun to do their topology, although I couldn’t find any “free downloads” of it.</p>

it looks allright, the horns dont look the greatest and on the subject of the undo, i think you can, but you need to change the limit in the prefrences?[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, i may of had overkilled it with the snake hook brush. I did that because it looked to smooth and plain, then i tried other brushes, but couldn’t find a result i was satisfied with, snakehooks looked decent imo. But i did over use it a little.</p>
<p>Also, i don’t know how to change really any preferences, i just download the trial last night, as soon as i installed it i went to sleep. After i woke up, i started working on this. All i did was throw in a sphere and went wild <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
