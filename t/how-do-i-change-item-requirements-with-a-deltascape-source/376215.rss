    <title>How do i Change item requirements with a deltascape source?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-change-item-requirements-with-a-deltascape-source/376215</link>
    <description>Ok, so basically my cousin and i are starting a server and its going well, but we have noticed that items like void and vester and statius all dont have requirements (like 60 str 60 atk 60 def, stuff like that). So i looked at some guides and they all said to go into the weapons.java and change it, but my cousins said he doesnt have that in his files. (remember we have a deltascape source) So, pretty much there is no way to change it that we know of. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks for reading :D</description>
