    <title>God Wars Bosses? only need one more!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/god-wars-bosses-only-need-one-more/255539</link>
    <description>I have spent several hours trying to find all of the god wars bosses and i have got all of them but K&#39;ril Tsutsaroth, Zamorak&#39;s general i would be willing to exchange models or something if anyone else needs the remaining 3 models  Commander Zilyana, General Graardor, Kree&#39;arra

If anyone has any models that have to do with god wars that would also be greatly appreciated!!</description>

              <p>Oh it is there, but it is separated into about 5 different parts, you may mistake it for a regular demon, but it is amongst the god wars stuff.<br>
Oh yeah, it doesn’t work it game.<br>
Zamorak boss’ polygon count is too high for the 317 client.</p>
