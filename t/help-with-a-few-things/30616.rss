    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-a-few-things/30616</link>
    <description>1) How to i put a cap on my hp, because when people use guthans it goes over the hp limit.
2) How do i change items to stackable and unstackable.
3) How to i put a cap on my total level because it does the same thing as hp, but also as you eat food it adds that to your total level.
4) Ok for you people that have the new cache, i do but how do i incorporate it into my server so people can also view items as they appear with the clients and also have the ability to get the new stuff? I tryed replacing thew cashe it changed nothing :(

All i can think of right now for my server so if any1 knows these send me a message or post here, thanks :)</description>
