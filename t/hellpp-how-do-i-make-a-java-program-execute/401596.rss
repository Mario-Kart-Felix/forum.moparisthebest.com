    <title>Hellpp... How do I make a Java program execute</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hellpp-how-do-i-make-a-java-program-execute/401596</link>
    <description>How do I make a program that, when a certain button is clicked, (the button in my interface that I made is named jStartServ) will open an external program, or, in other words, how do I get one of my buttons on my interface to run a batch file, or any other file.

Any suggestions or a straight answer is greatly appreciated! Couldn&#39;t find any Java tutorials on neither Google, Youtube nor here.</description>

To execute a program in java. Also, be wary of that doing this you might break Java’s multiplatform ability (not sure, but I think batch code in Runtime.getRuntime().exec dosen’t work on every OS). If your not asking for this, you need to explain yourself better.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes it would break the “independence” of Java. What <span class="bbcode-i">Runtime.getRuntime().exec()</span> does can be thought of as opening the shell (the CMD prompt on windows, or Terminal on Linux/Mac) and executing the String.</p>
<p>For example, doing</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Runtime.getRuntime().exec("start restart.bat");</code></pre>
<p>would work for a windows machine, but since Linux doesn’t have a “start” command, it would result in an exception being thrown (hopefully). If it was altered so that the OS would know what to do with the command (let’s say, Linux had the command “start”), it still wouldn’t know what to do with the bat file, because linux doesn’t natively support batch files. I mean, you could probably download a program that parses the batch code, and executes the contents correctly (ie. changing “copy” to “cp”). But that also results in a problem since most people here use absolute paths. So the following code wouldn’t execute cross-platform</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe" SomeClass</code></pre>
<p>first of all because linux doesn’t use the letter naming for drives.</p>
<p>If however, you made a link to a file called “java.exe” in the specified directory, it wouldn’t run the program because it doesn’t know how to execute exe files. (unless it was built with Mono, in which case, you’d still have to do “mono java.exe”)</p>
<p>In general, it’s not considered a good idea to do things like this.</p>
