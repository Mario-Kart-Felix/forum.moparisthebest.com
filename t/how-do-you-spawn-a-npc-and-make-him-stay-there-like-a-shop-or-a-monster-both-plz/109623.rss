And spawn a new NPC, this is the format description.</p>
<p>Spawn = #, # Is the ID of the NPC.<br>
The next two numbers are the X &amp; Y Co-Ordinates.<br>
The next, is the high level. To find these go where you want to spawn the NPC and type in ::mypos. It will give you all you need.<br>
The next are walk ranges, walk type and descriptions. For ranges, you’ll see x1 y1 x2 y2. Just replace it with the Co-Ordinates of the spawn, it wont move at all <span class="bbcode-b">OR</span> if you’re feeling clever, try to figure it out.<br>
For Walktype put 0, and for the description… Just put anything/</p>
