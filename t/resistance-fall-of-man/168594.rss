    <title>Resistance: Fall of Man</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resistance-fall-of-man/168594</link>
    <description>For those who haven&#39;t played Resistance, it is a war game for PS3 which is online and has a &#39;story&#39; or &#39;career&#39;. 

By the way, i haven&#39;t played this game in about 2 months, so tell me if there is a good update that I&#39;ve missed since then please.

The game has detailed parts, which is kind of interesting to me.

The game seems kind of futuristic/present/past. To me anyways.

Here is the game put in very short words:

Story:
In my opinion, it is a game where it is pretty much the end of the world and you have to fight with the fellow army troops against &#39;aliens&#39; who are trying take over earth while getting rid of all humans. For the &#39;aliens&#39; attempt to take over the world, they take humans and take their technology and make them into troops to fight for them  instead of for earth. You are part of the humans side attempting to save the earth. The game can get quite fun when you get into it. (A few fun gun&#39;s too :P)

Online:
This is where a lot of the people play. It is your team vs the other team. Usually humans vs aliens. A lot of maps. A lot of fun guns to kill with  :D. There is a lot of things to can do to make your game more fun (e.g You could add the option that with one shot it kills them instantly.)

My favorite guns:
Shotgun (before they updated it so it couldn&#39;t kill in 1-2 shots.)
Rocket launcher (that&#39;s a easy one to guess)
Bullseye (aliens default weapon)
The default weapon (forget name)
The bomb that explodes in spikes (forget name)
The double weapons (forgot name) (only for story mode once you beat the hardest one.)
[b]For the names I forgot I will get them later tonight or tomorrow. [/b]

My favorite map: 
The ship (online)</description>
