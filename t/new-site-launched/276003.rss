    <description>Hi,

I just launched a website with a couple friends called sharetolearn. It&#39;s basically a collaboration of knowledge from people around the world about... well, anything. I&#39;d like some feedback about the layout, colors, and general usability. Some of you might notice that the layout looks similar to fmylife.com, and you&#39;re right; I got the idea for the site while reading fmylife, but the entire site is coded from scratch by me and my friend.

              <p>no, Uriko’s idea is better: allow the user to select the opposite option later, and update accordingly… it was a bit of work, but the changes have been committed.</p>
