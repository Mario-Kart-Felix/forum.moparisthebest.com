    <title>Hey guys. (An introduction &amp; a question about my dillemma.)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hey-guys-an-introduction-a-question-about-my-dillemma/293078</link>
    <description>Well, about three years back my older brother (~N~, -N-, N-ick, &amp; Mindfreakthakur or just Nick irl), started getting into RuneScape Private Servers, and it was when RuneScape was in it&#39;s prime. I was interested but a naive 12 or 13 year old who knew nothing about servers, so I just followed my brothers instructions and played the original MoparScape with Aryan. For the longest time it was awesome, but then we got into different servers (Stranded Isle for example), and played those. After about a half year, my brother joined MoparScape, and he created his first sever (Fallen Isle). Throughout the years I went on playing different games as he worked on various servers getting his main help from MoparScape, until releasing about 3 other servers. One day he filled shits &#39;cause he was banned from MoparScape for making another account (Which he didn&#39;t know was against the rules because he never READ the freakin&#39; rules) and he pretty much dropped what he was doing on his server (Vengeance-Frenzy V2). He tried RuneLocus and he tried Rune-Sever and he got somewhere with the C&amp;P tutorials (Fail ftw), but he eventually gave up servers about a week after being banned. 

So, what I&#39;m asking is,

Is my computer banned from MoparScape forever due to my brother&#39;s retardedness? If so, I&#39;m going to probably NOT want to make my server, and end up leaving behind a great server and source I&#39;ve started on.

(If you are wondering how I&#39;m asking this, I&#39;m on my grandma&#39;s computer hehe.)</description>
