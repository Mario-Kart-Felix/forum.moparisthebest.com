    <description>Any thoughts on creating a standard database schema for runescape private servers? Along with standard stored procedure definitions?</description>

              <p>I have to agree with Davidi2 on the “opportunities” comment. However, wouldn’t it be logical to grab rather than to store if you were to use this? Mind you, it’s been a while since I’ve been around. I could be talking completely out of my ass, but using an outside source to store data doesn’t seem to be necessary if it can be stored within it’s own environment. (excuse the somewhat-ambiguous terminology)</p>
<p>However, I’d promote grabbing things for highscores, or any int variable for that matter to display on a more visually appealing canvas than an rs client. Just a stupid thought from the stupid kid that dropped out of the scene forever.</p>

<p>Well I’m not advocating that this is the sole way to setup a multi-server infrastructure for RSPS or anything, I’m just aware of Jagex doing it this way. You send your login authentication packet to the game server, which then resends it to a loginserver to verify whether you’re already logged in and whether your login is valid. The loginserver is then responsible for maintaining your logged state. When you logout of the gameserver, the gameserver must send the logout packet to the login server (many times this doesn’t happen, which leads to session issues in currently live rs). There’s also the friends/chat servers which maintain communication between players. I always assumed that these were one in the same with the loginservers, but some of the things jagex have said over the last few months make me think they aren’t.</p>

<p>Only referentially. All the extra data doesn’t really need to be there. Like I said earlier, it doesn’t fit into the general jagex-styled server infrastructure. You would need a shared database system for players and individual database systems for each server, which seems messy to me.</p>

I never really looked at the cache itself but I remember some things not working ‘out of the box’ when I was writing my server, like examine texts and item stats. Note it was a 508, I’m not sure if there is a difference in that but yea. Mind you I still think having definitions in database format is worthwhile (even if not for the server), it opens up your opportunities for web and other development greatly. Think: wiki, web trading with info, etc</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I don’t think adding npc, item, and world definitions is really necessary. The server is limited by what content the client already has, seeing as the server can only manipulate that (with the exception of custom regions for instanced realms). The item, world, and npc definitions should be loaded from the cache files and all general, persistent content should be stored in the database.</p>
<p>Think about it from a production point of view. If you were to ever update your items, npcs, and/or world objects or landscape files, you could do it in 1 pass when repacking the cache and just provide that to the server (seeing as the server handles updating, as well), or you would need to parse those definitions and insert them into the database, adding additional load and requirement.</p>
<p>As far as an infrastructure point of view goes, whether or not Jagex uses databases per server is in question. I’m fairly certain they don’t use database servers, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they used SQL Lite or some equivalent. As far as the player’s profiles are concerned, those are stored within their few loginservers on oracle database servers. That essentially means that none of those content fields you suggested would be stored with the player, only the player’s own information. When it comes to things like shops and where an NPC is in the world, those don’t need to be persisted anyway and can be stored directly in server memory (or, as I referenced before, in a SQL Lite database).</p>

              <p>well my gut reaction is a table of username, pid so you can cross reference other tables such as stats, inventory, equipment, and the like.</p>

select attack from stats where pid = apid</code></pre>
