    <description>[center][size=24pt][u][b]EVAi - Brilliance in the making[/b][/u][/size][/center]
I am making a new RS2 317 base called EVAi. The main basis of EVAi is to put everything into a scripting format to where people who do not really know how to code can not ruin the core of the program, thus, making it only as perfect as the core, which I will try my very hardest to make as good as possible. EVAi is running off of no base and is from 100% scratch, only using Cryption.java and stream.java from Winterlove (stream.java will be removed soon). If you are looking for design in the server, such as quests and etc, this thread is not for you, but if you want a stable server that will stay stable nomatter how much people mess with it, you might have some interest to this.

[size=12pt][b]About Myself[/b][/size]
Hello fellow moparscapians, everyone who is reading my post. I&#39;m Coelho and am fairly new here when it comes to posting what I am doing, and I find myself coming to post this to be quite a shocker. I have been coding Java for about 2 years now and have become pretty good at the languages Java, PHP, VB.net, C++, and C#, my profession being in Java.

[size=12pt][b]Coding-wise Analysis[/b][/size]
Most of the files in the server are not being used and I am still moving everything out of Player.java into them, however, most is done. I am using more of a scheduler format other than just a huge thread with a bunch of if statements to process everything. Most operations will have their own class files, and as I code i&#39;ll add more class files. For now, I am doing the bare minimum to get a decent structure working before I work on events and etc.

I&#39;ve tested the server on my 2.6ghz dual core, 4gb ddr2 ram Windows 7 computer and it can hold well over 2000 players. I suppose if anyone actually hosts this they would get a better computer to run it, so 2000 players is a dcecent amount. My CPU usage dosen&#39;t spike at all when i&#39;m running it, barley goes over 10%, and my memory stays constant at about ~400k. However, even though this was a test, it was not entirely accurate because the main reason the server crashed was because the Gpi had a buffer overflow, and it couldn&#39;t update the amount of people that were on the server, thus, dieing. I&#39;ll fix this when I really feel like working on the Gpi and then get an accurate rating.

[size=12pt][b]Future Goals on the Project[/b][/size]
To be honest, I don&#39;t think this may be finished with this post in mind. I might just finish it without updating this post, but oh well. At the moment I have over 6 other projects i&#39;m constantly working on, this being pretty low on my list, but still a priority nonetheless.

Simple things I need to do is clean out Player.java entirely, look a bit into the Gpi client-side to understand it a little more, make non-player-charaters, basic stuff. This will be followed by creating all the basic skills, making it save to a database (It dosen&#39;t save at the moment), and maybe a detailed permissions system.The most important of them all to do is to create the scripting system. 

Once the server is done i&#39;ll also simply edit the Frames.java and Packets.java (protocol) to make it into a different revision of RS2, simply because I think 317 gets a bit, boring.

If I do release this, I really do hope that it becomes one of the number one sources to use, simply because of the scripting system. Current every day sources like Delta can be good in design, but once you get 500 players on the server you&#39;d be lucky for it not to crash. It also brings in the factor that almost every tutorial you follow on the Server Tutorials section just makes your server more cluttered and terrible. Project Insanity fixes this by organizing their code a lot more, but in the end, it will end up the same way. The only way to stop this from happening is to have a closed source where people can only script.

By the time I finish this I plan to make a fully functioning server with scripting in some type of format like Javascript, Jython, Jar plugins, or etc.

[size=12pt][b]Current Progress[/b][/size]
All you can do in the server as of this moment, is walk around, talk, bank, drop items (dupe because I didn&#39;t make anything to handle drops), wear items, and make the server say that it&#39;s missing alot of opcodes (xD). 

[size=12pt][b]Release date[/b][/size]
I probably won&#39;t release this to be honest. I&#39;ll maybe just put it up as a simple server for everyone to play around on, then when I get bored i&#39;ll release it as closed source and simply let anyone who wants to script it. There should be no reason to edit the core at all seeing the chance that I make it good enough and bug free.

[size=12pt][b]Do you have any ideas?[/b][/size]
Please, keep your ideas off this thread if they have anything to do with custom items, skills, or anything of the sort. I do not want those ideas on my thread as I think they are useless to the main point of the project which is making a server core that has a scripting system and is relatively perfect.

If you have an idea relating to the core such as you know about Jython or Javascript being used as scripts for Java programs, do post it because to be honest, I only have any experience at Jar plugins, something I do not want to do due to the complexity in making them. No, it isn&#39;t hard to make Jar files, I just don&#39;t want posts such as, &quot;What is a Jar?&quot;, &quot;How do you make a jar?&quot;, &quot;Ummm it says it can&#39;t load my jar and that theres no class files inside it!&quot;.

[size=12pt][b]Updates[/b][/size]
[b]4/21/2011[/b] - Fixed Gpi sort of. Deleted the command packet server side and am using the main chat packet instead to handle commands. Commands really don&#39;t need their own packet, and i&#39;ll be deleted them soon anyway and adding a traditional console.

[b]4/20/2011[/b] - I renamed all the packages from &quot;EVAi.&quot; to &quot;com.iscoelho.EVAi&quot;, simply because it makes more sense. I focused today on making a simple background for the plugins and made the new &quot;com.iscoelho.EVAi.event&quot; package withtuns of classes in it for events, none of which work yet because none of the classes are used, but once I make the plugin handler i&#39;ll start using those classes I prepared.

I also redid the Processor and renamed it to Scheduler. I moved it into its own package aswell and took the subclasses inside that class out. You&#39;ll notice exactly what I did when I actually post a screenshot (Not happening until the Gpi is processing correctly) I&#39;m also using Main.java now only to start the program up, and instead am using Server.java to hold all the variables. World.java Listener.java and Processor.java are no longer static and are now variables inside Server.java, however Server.java IS static. When I feel like making Server.java not static, this will provide an excellent sandbox enviromnent for plugins in the program.

EDIT: Turns out there were 2 problems with the Gpi, one that I just fixed. The one that I just fixed had to do with the client removing the players off the local players list because it thought they left, but they didn&#39;t. I found this out by debugging and seeing how much times the players update and the appearance updates were enoromous. I then looked at what it considered a, &quot;Local player&quot; and it considered a local player to be always teleporting away. Woopsee! So now i&#39;m looking for the second one that has something to do with nothing updating except movement after the player is added to the local players list.

EDIT: I found it was only updating appearance when it was forced, so I looked farther into the problem. Then I noticed that I was actually processing the Gpi updates RIGHT AFTER I processed the packets. I split the two statememnts into different &quot;for&quot;s and it worked like a charm. It&#39;s always the obvious problems that you never look for... Will post a screenshot later today of progress. There is still a glitch with the Gpi where people are shown where theyre not supposed to be, and when you go toward them, they go farther away. Looking into this.

[code]if(lp.didTeleport &amp;&amp;
p.Location.withinRange(lp.Location, 16, true)) {
//I failed.[/code]

[b]4/19/2011[/b] - The GPI is really being annoying to me as of this moment, making it very hard for me to work with. As of this moment just for testing, i&#39;m making it so it dosen&#39;t add any players to your local players list. It works fine, so I am annoyed. EDIT: I&#39;ve narrowed it down to being a problem with &quot;appendPlayerAppearance&quot;, or something else that is conflicting with it.

[b]4/18/2011[/b] - Public release

[size=12pt][b]Credits[/b][/size]
[b]Coelho[/b] 85% - Created most of it
[b]Own[/b] 10% - Motivated me to make this and has been coding along side with me
[b]Winterlove[/b] 5% - Cryption.java and stream.java

[size=12pt][b]Picture Proof[/b][/size]
The picture speaks for itself. I can not add more pictures at the moment given that theres not much you can do. Do you want me to do an emote or something? Lol.

              <p>[quote=“Wintercanon, post:7, topic:391594”]Oh gosh do not use any classes from winterLove. The stream and Cryption from winterLove were ripped from the Jagex client and are pretty terrible. They are structured poorly because the client is only reading them and not manipulating and sending them.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t be ripping and removing useless stuff from your player class yet since you just wrote it? I think what you’ve done is ripped apart winterLove. I’m assuming you’ll be using standard IO?</p>
<p>Also if you’re going to release the core closed source then you’re going to have to provide a pretty in-depth API, as writing scripts will still need to access player and networking properties.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thank you for your opinions, and I will answer to every one of them. Cryption.java is perfectly fine, theres no problems with it. Stream.java as i’m already stating is being moved into InStream.java and OutStream.java, all of the methods being redone.</p>
<p>I did not rip apart winterlove, everything is created by me. The player.java needs organizing because the way I code, is I put everything in one class file, then organize it, then organize it some more, until it becomes halfway decent. I agree, it’s a terrible way, but it turns out pretty good once i’m done. Most of the time, myself being not having not a formal education in coding, I look at other projects for education and knowledge off of that, as do most people on this forum.</p>
<p>I’ll just generate a simple Java API using the notes I make in the class files, and that should do the trick. I’m also thinking of having every script have their own folder in the “scripts” folder and basically a “script.cfg” in that folder that says the directory to the main class etc. This way it makes it easier for developers to develop, because i’d simply hate to have to JAR it every time I need to test it again.</p>
<hr>
<p>EDIT: I renamed all the packages from “EVAi.” to “com.iscoelho.EVAi”, simply because it makes more sense. I focused today on making a simple background for the plugins and made the new “com.iscoelho.EVAi.event” package withtuns of classes in it for events, none of which work yet because none of the classes are used, but once I make the plugin handler i’ll start using those classes I prepared.</p>

<p>EDIT: Fixed the Gpi entirely, thank god. Will post a screenshot later today.</p>

Hello fellow moparscapians, everyone who is reading my post. I’m Coelho and am fairly new here when it comes to posting what I am doing, and I find myself coming to post this to be quite a shocker. I have been coding Java for about 2 years now and have become pretty good at the languages Java, PHP, <a href="http://VB.net" rel="nofollow noopener">VB.net</a>, C++, and C#, my profession being in Java.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Coding-wise Analysis</span>[/size]<br>
Most of the files in the server are not being used and I am still moving everything out of Player.java into them, however, most is done. I am using more of a scheduler format other than just a huge thread with a bunch of if statements to process everything. Most operations will have their own class files, and as I code i’ll add more class files. For now, I am doing the bare minimum to get a decent structure working before I work on events and etc.</p>
<p>I’ve tested the server on my 2.6ghz dual core, 4gb ddr2 ram Windows 7 computer and it can hold well over 2000 players. I suppose if anyone actually hosts this they would get a better computer to run it, so 2000 players is a dcecent amount. My CPU usage dosen’t spike at all when i’m running it, barley goes over 10%, and my memory stays constant at about ~400k. However, even though this was a test, it was not entirely accurate because the main reason the server crashed was because the Gpi had a buffer overflow, and it couldn’t update the amount of people that were on the server, thus, dieing. I’ll fix this when I really feel like working on the Gpi and then get an accurate rating.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Future Goals on the Project</span>[/size]<br>
To be honest, I don’t think this may be finished with this post in mind. I might just finish it without updating this post, but oh well. At the moment I have over 6 other projects i’m constantly working on, this being pretty low on my list, but still a priority nonetheless.</p>
<p>Simple things I need to do is clean out Player.java entirely, look a bit into the Gpi client-side to understand it a little more, make non-player-charaters, basic stuff. This will be followed by creating all the basic skills, making it save to a database (It dosen’t save at the moment), and maybe a detailed permissions system.The most important of them all to do is to create the scripting system.</p>
<p>Once the server is done i’ll also simply edit the Frames.java and Packets.java (protocol) to make it into a different revision of RS2, simply because I think 317 gets a bit, boring.</p>
<p>If I do release this, I really do hope that it becomes one of the number one sources to use, simply because of the scripting system. Current every day sources like Delta can be good in design, but once you get 500 players on the server you’d be lucky for it not to crash. It also brings in the factor that almost every tutorial you follow on the Server Tutorials section just makes your server more cluttered and terrible. Project Insanity fixes this by organizing their code a lot more, but in the end, it will end up the same way. The only way to stop this from happening is to have a closed source where people can only script.</p>
<p>By the time I finish this I plan to make a fully functioning server with scripting in some type of format like Javascript, Jython, Jar plugins, or etc.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Current Progress</span>[/size]<br>
All you can do in the server as of this moment, is walk around, talk, bank, drop items (dupe because I didn’t make anything to handle drops), wear items, and make the server say that it’s missing alot of opcodes (xD).</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Release date</span>[/size]<br>
I probably won’t release this to be honest. I’ll maybe just put it up as a simple server for everyone to play around on, then when I get bored i’ll release it as closed source and simply let anyone who wants to script it. There should be no reason to edit the core at all seeing the chance that I make it good enough and bug free.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Do you have any ideas?</span>[/size]<br>
Please, keep your ideas off this thread if they have anything to do with custom items, skills, or anything of the sort. I do not want those ideas on my thread as I think they are useless to the main point of the project which is making a server core that has a scripting system and is relatively perfect.</p>
<p>If you have an idea relating to the core such as you know about Jython or Javascript being used as scripts for Java programs, do post it because to be honest, I only have any experience at Jar plugins, something I do not want to do due to the complexity in making them. No, it isn’t hard to make Jar files, I just don’t want posts such as, “What is a Jar?”, “How do you make a jar?”, “Ummm it says it can’t load my jar and that theres no class files inside it!”.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Updates</span>[/size]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">4/21/2011</span> - Fixed Gpi sort of. Deleted the command packet server side and am using the main chat packet instead to handle commands. Commands really don’t need their own packet, and i’ll be deleted them soon anyway and adding a traditional console.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">4/20/2011</span> - I renamed all the packages from “EVAi.” to “com.iscoelho.EVAi”, simply because it makes more sense. I focused today on making a simple background for the plugins and made the new “com.iscoelho.EVAi.event” package withtuns of classes in it for events, none of which work yet because none of the classes are used, but once I make the plugin handler i’ll start using those classes I prepared.</p>
<p>I also redid the Processor and renamed it to Scheduler. I moved it into its own package aswell and took the subclasses inside that class out. You’ll notice exactly what I did when I actually post a screenshot (Not happening until the Gpi is processing correctly) I’m also using Main.java now only to start the program up, and instead am using Server.java to hold all the variables. World.java Listener.java and Processor.java are no longer static and are now variables inside Server.java, however Server.java IS static. When I feel like making Server.java not static, this will provide an excellent sandbox enviromnent for plugins in the program.</p>
<p>EDIT: Turns out there were 2 problems with the Gpi, one that I just fixed. The one that I just fixed had to do with the client removing the players off the local players list because it thought they left, but they didn’t. I found this out by debugging and seeing how much times the players update and the appearance updates were enoromous. I then looked at what it considered a, “Local player” and it considered a local player to be always teleporting away. Woopsee! So now i’m looking for the second one that has something to do with nothing updating except movement after the player is added to the local players list.</p>
<p>EDIT: I found it was only updating appearance when it was forced, so I looked farther into the problem. Then I noticed that I was actually processing the Gpi updates RIGHT AFTER I processed the packets. I split the two statememnts into different "for"s and it worked like a charm. It’s always the obvious problems that you never look for… Will post a screenshot later today of progress. There is still a glitch with the Gpi where people are shown where theyre not supposed to be, and when you go toward them, they go farther away. Looking into this.</p>
<p><code>if(lp.didTeleport &amp;&amp;
p.Location.withinRange(lp.Location, 16, true)) {
//I failed.</code></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">4/19/2011</span> - The GPI is really being annoying to me as of this moment, making it very hard for me to work with. As of this moment just for testing, i’m making it so it dosen’t add any players to your local players list. It works fine, so I am annoyed. EDIT: I’ve narrowed it down to being a problem with “appendPlayerAppearance”, or something else that is conflicting with it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">4/18/2011</span> - Public release</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Credits</span>[/size]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Coelho</span> 85% - Created most of it<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Own</span> 10% - Motivated me to make this and has been coding along side with me<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Winterlove</span> 5% - Cryption.java and stream.java</p>
<p>[size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Picture Proof</span>[/size]<br>
The picture speaks for itself. I can not add more pictures at the moment given that theres not much you can do. Do you want me to do an emote or something? Lol.<br>
