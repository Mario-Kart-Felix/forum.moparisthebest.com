    <description>Hey guys!

Im thinking about creating a old-school server with low xp rates, I currently have a dedicated server 750gb hard drive and 1gbps port.  Over kill for a rs server lol =D. Any hoo if anyone is interested go to this ip (REMOVED LINK JUST REALISED YOUR NOT ALLOWED TO) register on the forum and leave your Skype there or on here so we can chat. The source will most likely be shard&#39;s creativescape.

I just now created the forum so its a little bare, Just putting a net out to see if anyone is interested. 

I currently need a advertiser, simple coder.

Thanks

P-s I was thinking about calling the server FarScape.. lol what do you guys think.
