    <title>Explaining basic commands</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/explaining-basic-commands/342490</link>
    <description>Note: This is not the same as [b]Operators[/b], this is [u]VERY[/u] basic knowledge, but of course, there&#39;s always someone that needs it.

1. Teleporting commands.
Okay, well, this one, extremely basic, and usually quite short, of course, if you&#39;re imaginative, there&#39;s a lot you can do with these.

Initially, teleporting commands consist of 3 lines, the command line, the effect, and the closing brace, like so.
[code=java]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;command&quot;)){
sM(&quot;This is the effect&quot;);
} //Closing brace[/code]

Of course, this can be modified, with triggerTele, it treats the command as a teleport, as if you were to actually do so, however this can be modified.

[code=java]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;home&quot;)){
toX = XCoord;
toY = YCoord;
}[/code]

Instead of teleporting, this just MOVES your character to the allocated Co-Ordinates. Therefore, it will not abide by any effects such as, being teleblocked, being in the wilderness, or in a non-telezone, etc.

Teleporting commands can be modified though, to work like normal teleports even. With modification, observe.

[code=java]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;varrock&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(554) &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(556) &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(563)){
triggerTele(####, ####, #);
addSkillXP(100, 6);
deleteItem(554, 1);
deleteItem(556, 1);
deleteItem(563, 1);
} Else {
sM(&quot;You don&#39;t have enough runes to cast this spell&quot;);
}
}[/code]

If I&#39;m not mistaken, that is correct, and basically is the teleport to varrock spell, in command form! The only flaw is, it requires one air, instead of the three. It will even delete the runes &amp; give exp, let me explain.

[code=java]&amp;&amp; playerHasItem(554) &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(556) &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(563)){[/code]

Means it checks for itemID 554, 556 &amp; 563, before making the command work.

[code=java]} Else {[/code]
It&#39;ll sendMessage. (sM).

[code=java]} Else {
sM(&quot;You don&#39;t have enough runes to cast this spell&quot;);[/code]

However, if it has the required items, it&#39;ll proceed with the command.

[code=java]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;varrock&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(554) &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(556) &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(563)){
triggerTele(####, ####, #);
addSkillXP(100, 6);
deleteItem(554, 1);
deleteItem(556, 1);
deleteItem(563, 1);[/code]

It will teleport &amp; Add 100 magic Experience

[code=java]triggerTele(####, ####, #);
addSkillXP(100, 6);[code]

Like so.
and it will Delete the runes.

[code=java]
deleteItem(554, 1);
deleteItem(556, 1);
deleteItem(563, 1);[/code]

Sounds pretty simple right? It is.

For Delta
[code]sM(&quot;Message&quot;); //Sends a message
triggerTele(XCoord, YCoord, Height); //Teleports you
toX = XCoord; 
toX = YCoord; // Moves your character
addSkillXP(EXP, SkillID); // Adds Skill Experience
addItem(ItemID, Ammount); // Adds an item
deleteItem(ItemId, Ammount); // Removes an item[/code]

Now, I beleive, one I haven&#39;t explained. Basically, I&#39;m going to teach you how to add a &quot;Grand exchange&quot;, kind of thing, although it wont be accurate, it&#39;s a rather good use of this, I&#39;m about to show you.

[code=java]openUpShop(ID);[/code]

Okay, so basically, with the use of a command, this will open up a shop. To which you can sell &amp; buy items to.
To create this, go into shops configuration and and on the bottom of your shops, start a new line.

[code=java]shop = ##	Grand_Exchange	2	2[/code]

Add that to the bottom, above &#39;[END]&#39;.
Replace ## with the number 1 higher than the shop above, example, if the shop above says 46, make your number 47.

Now, go into client class, and where you&#39;d put commands, add this;

[code=java]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;exchange&quot;)){
openUpShop(ReplaceThisWithYourShopID);
}[/code]

And there you have it, using a command to add a very primitive grand exchange, but hey, it&#39;s better than nothing.
This is more or less the extent to adding beneficial player commands to your server, if you still have questions, ask, if you think I have mistyped something, or input wrong information, please inform me, I am well-aware this is very likely, I&#39;m not very experienced myself.</description>
