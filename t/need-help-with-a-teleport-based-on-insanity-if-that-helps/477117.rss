    <title>Need help with a Teleport (based on insanity if that helps)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-a-teleport-based-on-insanity-if-that-helps/477117</link>
    <description>I want to make a dungeon teleport in magebook tab,
what i already did: change the name of my telebutton to &quot;Dungeon Teleports&quot;
Logged in and pressed button &quot;Dungeon Teleports&quot;, so i could see in cmd what button it is in ClickButtons.java
under the button case i putted this

c.getDH().sendOption2(&quot;Slayer Dungeons&quot;, More Comming soon&quot;);
under this i tried alot of things but nothing seem to connect me to second sendOption
Break;

i do know how to make &quot;Slayer Dungeons&quot; teleports me to somwhere
but, i want if you click &quot;Slayer Dungeon&quot; another option tab opens and says (&quot;Slayer Dungeon 1&quot;, &quot;Slayer Dungeon 2&quot;)
and then teleport me to a dungeon
so i have space in the dungeon teleport options for other dungeons, since i&#39;m making 3 slayer caves, i wanted them in a second option chat

you can always check out my rsps, still need a helping coder, www.Tormented.be

grtz Jonas i hope someone could help me with this! thanks anyways
if you&#39;d think my project looks awsome, still need someone to assist me coding, add me on skype: j.sjegers</description>
