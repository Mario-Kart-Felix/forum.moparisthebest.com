              <p>Regarding the OP, inflation is the big important thing.</p>
<p>This is one of the points of clash between different classes.<br>
High inflation disproportionately hurts rich people because it makes their fortunes worth less. High unemployment disproportionately hurts poor people because they find it harder to go for a long time without a job.</p>
<p>So as a general rule, usually if you have a left wing government in power they will promote full employment, if you have a right wing government in power they will try to lower inflation.</p>
<p>Nothing to do with helping or hurting the economy, just helping their core voters.</p>
<p>Related but separate is how unemployment is seen by the different classes. The owner class like high unemployment because it drives wage costs down. The more unemployed workers we add to an economy, the more wages fall. An example of this correlation can be seen in the U.S. recession of 1982, when unemployment nearly hit 11 percent in the fourth quarter, and real hourly wages fell nearly 50 cents from three years before. The flip-side to this example is the 1980s “Massachusetts Miracle,” when unemployment fell to a phenomenally low 2.7 percent, and McDonald’s began offering twice the minimum wage ($7 an hour) trying to attract workers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think it “hurts” it as much as it would simply restrict it, like lawl said.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Many would say that such a restriction is hurting it. If an economy isn’t consistently growing, it is hurting.<br>
[/quote]<br>
An unrestricted economy leads to the problems we have seen the last years.[/quote]</p>
<p>IMO, we’re talking about two completely different types of restrictions here. Bowser jr’s restrictions are imposed by the government, whereas the restriction as a result of low unemployment is imposed by the market. The governmental restriction is usually a good thing, because you want solid growth, not a boom. During booms, investors lose that tiny bit of rationale they have, and the value of stocks greatly surpasses the value they represent. The bubble gets even bigger, until it can’t sustain itself anymore and the bubble pops. Only a few smart investors know how to profit from it, so you get a massive wealth redistribution. During these bubble’s, blue collar workers invest in the stock market too. Some do it directly, but most do it via mortgages linked to the stock market or similar products. They end up losing, because they have no idea what’s happening and the banks tell them nothing’s wrong.</p>
<p>The restriction from the job market is bad. In most industrialized countries, the demand for workers with a low education on the long run is pretty stable. In a growing economy, it’s the demand for people with a high education that grows. The amount of highly educated people is limited. You can open a tin of Mexicans, but they wont become consultants or CEO’s. So there’s nothing you can do about it, except slowing the growth.</p>
<p>I’m against the free market. I agree with arguments such as ‘the market will fix itself’, because it does. But at a cost. Let me throw in a biblical story, as most free market lovers are Republican, and thus Christian (massive stereotype, I know). The story of the Pharaoh’s dream tells about fat cows coming from a river, followed by lean cows that ate the fat ones. Joseph explains this as follows: in the next seven years, the harvests will be more than plenty, the cattle will grow fat, and the people will have more than enough to eat. A boom. The seven years that follow, will be seven years of bad harvests, lean cattle and hunger. So the plan is to save food during the good years, in order to have enough food to survive the bad years. There you go, the market fixes itself. But was it a free market? Did the government (the Pharaoh) let the market be? Nope, he ordered the construction of storage rooms for food.</p>
<p>So what happens these days, when the market is booming? During the massive growth of the housing market, a lot of people owned at least one house. Many owned more. Prices kept climbing, and noone deemed it wise to save up a bit of money. People spent all they had, and even more money they didn’t have. So now, during the lean years, companies go bankrupt, governments have to cut, and citizens have to save banks. So now the government has to fix the market.</p>
<p>I guess we need more restrictions, instead of less.</p>

There isn’t any totally unrestricted economies in my opinion, but take US as an example. There was no control over the dept, so it ran out of control and the economy crashed.

<p>But in the other way it took away peoples economical restrictions.</p>
<p>Anyways, Carter was president in 1977-81, why didn’t anyone stop forcing banks to give loans to people who could not pay back? 30 years should be enough time.</p>
<p>PS: So you are saying that the banks did in no way encourage people to take loans they shouldn’t have taken?Or warning people about taking too big loans?</p>
