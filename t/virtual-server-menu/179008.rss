    <title>Virtual server menu</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/virtual-server-menu/179008</link>
    <description>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in the netgear dg834gt portforward guide it says that i enter the settings in the virtual server menu. where is this?

also when i type cmd. i look for the two dns server addresses(the ones that you need to enter in internet protcol dns thing) but all i see is only one dns server address which is the same as my gateway. What do i put as the alternative dns server?

All help is needed.

also could this be the reason why my server aint going online and i did what the guide said.</description>
