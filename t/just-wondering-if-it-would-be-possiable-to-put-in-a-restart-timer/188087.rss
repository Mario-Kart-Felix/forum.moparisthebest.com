    <description>Just wondering if it would be possiable to put in a little timer that showed how long until a restart. The server owner could set it to 10, 30, 60 minutes, or no restart. Mabye once the server did reboot the timer also restarted..... Was just wondering if anyone out there could code something like this. Would let people know that the server will be coming back online. Just a thought....[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 10, 2008, 12:48:47 PM[/size][hr]Could anyone code this?</description>
