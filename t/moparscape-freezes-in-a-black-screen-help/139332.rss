    <title>Moparscape Freezes in a Black Screen? Help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-freezes-in-a-black-screen-help/139332</link>
    <description>When I put my Moparscape on, I log in and then there comes: Loading Please wait.... And I can&#39;t press a thing, so i&#39;ve guessed that my Java was bad. BUT. I have the latest Java for this time and I don&#39;t know what to do.. I mean I have a server to watch after etc.
I&#39;d be great full if someone could help me.

Thanks,
Footee.</description>
