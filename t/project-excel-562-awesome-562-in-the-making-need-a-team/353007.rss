    <description>alright guys, i made a server awhile back called razenclaw 562, i can honestly say it was a MAJOR leech and a fail, but had about 35-45+ players on. But before that, i was a 508 coder but i just wanted sumtin new. But while running that 562 a learned a lot of 562 coding and stuff.

I took a break from RSPS and went and played CoD and some runescape.

But, after loosing 3 runescape accounts, (all pretty good btw) i am deciding to come back to RSPS, and to make another 562, and i want it to be great. I&#39;ve noticed that there hasnt been a lot of good 508+ servers around, except like pkmadness or some other servers, so i want to make a DOPE 562

I plan on using Geo&#39;s NRscape release. Although he did a great job, he did a lot of really bad stuff that im fixing atm...BUT i still need some help with other things. Now i dont have any money atm, me only being 15. I had about $125 on a paypal but then i got keylogged and lost it, BUT if you decide to help, and it accually gets...GOING...i plan i paying you for your help. I know how to do all the &#39;little&#39; stuff (ex-Npc spawns, shops, commands, and teles, click object,etc)
