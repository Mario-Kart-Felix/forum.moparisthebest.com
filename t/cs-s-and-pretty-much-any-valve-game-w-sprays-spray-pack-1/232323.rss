    <title>CS:S (and pretty much any Valve game w/ sprays) Spray Pack 1</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cs-s-and-pretty-much-any-valve-game-w-sprays-spray-pack-1/232323</link>
    <description>Posting for lulz, maybe some of the members will find these useful. Installation instructions are included.

Includes some basic decoy sprays (you&#39;ll see + the bomb one is animated), the LOL JEBUS PP spray (for trolling all your favorite Christian servers), and of course, the [juden] Swazzy (swastika) spray.
