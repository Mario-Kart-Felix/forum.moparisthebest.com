    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Bell Canada is taking an interesting approach to being called out for lying in its ads to consumers concerning network performance: it&#39;s simply ignoring the whole thing. Advertising Standards Canada (ASC) found that Bell Canada was being quite misleading in claiming that Bell Canada was the &quot;fastest network across North America.&quot; Now, there may be different ways to judge the speed of broadband offered on a network, and you would think that a company would respond with some data to support its side. Bell Canada, on the other hand, has said that it simply doesn&#39;t recognize ASC as a legitimate organization, and therefore, it can go about its business and advertising.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What a truly ignorant company. My ISP is Bell and I don&#39;t find them very good at all... I can&#39;t wait until my contract is over so I can switch over to Cogeco.</description>

Bell officially pissed me off when they lowered our monthly bandwidth from unlimited to 60 gb, without telling us. And then we got charged for it.</p>
<p>And you can forget calling in for support. If your lucky enough to not be put on hold for over 3 hours, you have to talk to some guy in India who knows less than you do and can’t even speak english worth a shit. You literally have to ask for a white guy if you want anything done.<br>

<p>edit: And by no way am I trying to be racist, it’s just cheaper for Bell to employ people in Indian call centers who really don’t know much.</p>

Anyway, Apple has been through some trouble in Britain, claming it’s the “fastest” network. They’ve been forced to change their ads over there AFAIK.</p>
