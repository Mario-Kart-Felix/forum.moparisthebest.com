    <description>[u]First... I&#39;ve downloaded the &quot;R00nscape Client&quot; and the &quot;377 Cache(or which ever)... And when [b]*I*[/b] try to log into the Client... It says &quot;Error Connecting To Server.&quot;[/u] [shadow=red,left]Anyone know the PROBLEM?[/shadow]

Second of the post... I need a little help for changing [b]starting-off Coordinates[/b] and the [b]starting off player look[/b]. May seem easy to anybody who knows these, but [b]*I*[/b] am clueless.

[u]Thanks for helping/reading my post! ~Purez4life~[/u]</description>

<p>Actually thats only for the respawn point after they die. If you want to change where the players are when they first log on go to player.java and search for</p>
