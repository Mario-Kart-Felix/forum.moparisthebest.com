    <title>Why is my PC so slow?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-is-my-pc-so-slow/444291</link>
    <description>Hello,
Basically my problem is my PC just isn&#39;t performing how it should. Even when my CPU usage and ram usage are at around 50% I start getting a bit of lag..
Allegedly according to malwarebytes, iobot and so forth(list too long for me to even mention) I have no viruses and so forth. I do have the odd tracking cookies but thats normal.

Does anyone know why this is happening? Better yet, does anyone know how to improve my system performance. I&#39;ve defragged my hdd etc(the common sense things).

I can no longer play bf2 in the maximum graphics option, about 6 months ago I had msn, fb, a bot running + other things + I was playing the game in the maximum graphics options.. I have a 1.5gb graphics card(1.4gb usable though).

I do not wish to reformat my PC..</description>

<p>I know how to maintain a PC I was just wondering if their were any NON obvious ways of speeding up my PC. Everything stated was obvious so this thread is pointless. I know how to look after my PC so please stop commenting saying do this do that to remove viruses or w.e.<br>
If a mod sees this, close this please. Caused more of an annoyance than anything else tbh.</p>

look at my thread: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,544817.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,544817.0.html</a><br>

<p>This is common for people who don’t know how to maintain their PCs. Defragging almost will never do anything - it’s all the programs and services running that don’t need to be. In theory, the only reason defragging your hard drive might do anything is because you have so many programs running and not enough RAM, so your computer is forced to use the page file, which could slow it down if your hard drive is cluttered. Also get rid of your anti-virus software. If you’re smart, you won’t need it, and your PC will gain a boost. I haven’t had any for years and I’ve stayed virus free the entire time.<br>
[/quote]How would you know you had a virus, other than loss of computer speed, without anti-virus software?[/quote]</p>
<p>Check your AppData (Windows + R, type %AppData% and press OK.) and delete any executable files you see there.<br>
Open msconfig (Windows + R, type in msconfig and press OK.) and disable any suspicious start up items, if not all of them.</p>
<p>You don’t even need antiviruses if you follow these 2 things (Viruses can also be in Sub directories of AppData, or even in C:\WINDOWS, but most commonly in AppData.)</p>

</aside>
<p>I have a a quad core 2.6ghz processor… You didn’t even ask what spec I have before saying to get a new one. A duo core and a i7 are VERY in terms of speed btw… Obviously it would assuming I had enough ram, thats common sense. Car doesn’t go fast enough, buy  a better engine or w.e. and your car will be faster…<br>
Why specifically a worm? Why would I infect myself with a worm?</p>

<p>Edit, usually there are misconseptions about the preformance having to do with your drive. Well i’d use diagnostics to figure that out first. Windows has all the diagnostics programs you need, just google them. If your drive’s corrupted or if the write speed is not what it should but just reformat and rebuild, if the drive’s dying get a new one. I’d say look into the processor and memory issues at the moment.</p>

Whats a ssd ;o?[/quote]<br>
Are you actually serious?</p>
<p>Solid State Drive, get used to the term, 5 years time and it’ll be the norm, already is becoming the norm in newer laptops, particularly ultrabooks.</p>
<p>It offers well over 5 times the read and write speeds over general hard drives, there are no spinning platters, it is more resistant to physical shocks and damage in terms of failure, and is consists of several chips of flash memory, iirc.</p>
<p>For example, I can get my laptop booted into the windows desktop in 15 seconds, booted into ubuntu in about 8 seconds.  And this thing is well over 2 years old and not even that high spec.  It is often said it is the most cost effective way to speed up your PC.</p>
<p>Cons: the cost, and sacrifice of capacity, not a problem with me with server based storage though.</p>

              <p>Easy and most effective fix: back up files and reinstall windows.  Also consider buying an ssd for a boot drive, I did this recently.</p>
<p>Long way (edit: actually doesn’t take that long, do most of this on a weekly basis anyway):</p>
<ol>
<li>Use ccleaner to clean temporary files and other unneeded files.  Tick all options.  Then use the built in registry scanner.</li>
<li>run &gt; msconfig, go to the boot tab and untick everything that is not absolutely vital to the running of the computer.</li>
<li>Give it a defrag, I personally use defraggler which I developed by the same company as ccleaner.</li>
<li>Don’t have too much ‘registry cleaners’ and definitely not too many anti viruses, it’s just unneeded.  When they are all actively monitoring folders for incoming viruses it can really slow you down.  Just stick to one and keep it, for me it’s just Microsoft Security Essentials, it does the job and I don’t even know it’s there.</li>
</ol>
<p>I tend to re install windows like every month anyway, I keep all my files stored on my network drives so it’s never a huge hassle to do so.</p>

Thanks for the advice, I’ll keep note of that. I always just assumed about 100 processes was normal tbh.</p>

<p>This is common for people who don’t know how to maintain their PCs. Defragging almost will never do anything - it’s all the programs and services running that don’t need to be. In theory, the only reason defragging your hard drive might do anything is because you have so many programs running and not enough RAM, so your computer is forced to use the page file, which could slow it down if your hard drive is cluttered. Also get rid of your anti-virus software. If you’re smart, you won’t need it, and your PC will gain a boost. I haven’t had any for years and I’ve stayed virus free the entire time.<br>
[/quote]How would you know you had a virus, other than loss of computer speed, without anti-virus software?<br>
[/quote]Well, you usually notice a virus. For example, files could get deleted or launched at any time, and I pay close attention to every one of my processes running. I know what every default process/service in XP is named, and I pay attention to the User group. For example, you’ll never see a real “svchost.exe” (service) running under a specific account. I only download stuff when I know it’s safe (mostly based on download count and user feedback if it’s something suspicious), so like I said, you won’t get viruses if you’re smart with your computer.[/quote]</p>
<p>You have described a typical virus that wants to harm the operating system. Most malware these days does its best to not hint you in any way that the system is compromised.</p>
<p>It’s wrong to rely on diagnostic tools in the system you’re inspecting to convince yourself that the system is clean. If the malware is sophisticated enough the functions used to get info about processes/files/registry keys/network connections are most likely hooked - and it filters out the info it doesn’t want you to see. When looking for an indicator of an infection I recommend monitoring connections for your PC in the router.</p>
<p>Anti-viruses are mostly useless. They only protect people who recklessly download files - and they protect you from the mainstream malware only. Any malicious program can be made to bypass an anti-virus when correct encryption techniques are used.</p>
<p>It’s also safe to expect that a ~6 month old OS installion is most likely infected. No matter how careful you are, during those ~6 months a vulnerability in your system will probably have been exploited. That’s why you should perform regular full cleanups on your system, not just formats but full zerofills.</p>

<p>This is common for people who don’t know how to maintain their PCs. Defragging almost will never do anything - it’s all the programs and services running that don’t need to be. In theory, the only reason defragging your hard drive might do anything is because you have so many programs running and not enough RAM, so your computer is forced to use the page file, which could slow it down if your hard drive is cluttered. Also get rid of your anti-virus software. If you’re smart, you won’t need it, and your PC will gain a boost. I haven’t had any for years and I’ve stayed virus free the entire time.[/quote]How would you know you had a virus, other than loss of computer speed, without anti-virus software?</p>
