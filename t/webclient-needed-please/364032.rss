When You Finish Tell Me:
1. The HTML Text That I Can Copy Into My Server
2. What Reward Number You Want.
3. If You Want To Join My Forums/Server.

Rewards:
Pick Two!
1. Server Moderator On My Server
2. Forum Moderator On My Forum

A Few Things You Should Know About My Server:

3. It Is Amazingly Awesome With All Teleports Working And Shops In Every Town. 
4. Working Monsters (none glitch) ( clipping )
5. Its Awesome.
