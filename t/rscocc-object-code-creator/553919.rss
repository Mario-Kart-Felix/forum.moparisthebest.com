    <description>Once again here I am with another release of a generator  :palm:
well see, I lost the old generator I created, which was actually
becoming a pretty fancy program.

I created one today to help myself along through my project
and figured i&#39;d release it since all of my old software links are
dead.

[b]Old software I created previously:[/b]

[b]WHAT IS THIS FOR?:[/b]

Well it saves you a lot of copying and pasting, instead
just fill in the form and press add keep it next to your
client as you walk around in-game to get your coords,
etc...

This is great for tree&#39;s.... click in a spot and change the
coord then press add to list. Fill the list up as full as you
want then finally, highlight the list and copy it using
ctrl + c then paste it into your gameobjectloc file, of course
underneath your current code don&#39;t make the mistake of
replacing it.

After your done pasting it, and saving it make sure you clear
your list using the clear list button. Otherwise you will have
duplicate objects laying on top of each other, or the server
won&#39;t start one of the two.

This is also great for people who want to take a project on
together, you can give your partner this software and say 
alright go make a list for the new castle, fill it up with furniture
and all of that good stuff.

Then he/she can copy and paste the list into a notepad file
and send it on over to you, allowing you to easily insert 
what they&#39;ve created into the game rather then having to 
pass your object file back and forth.

It&#39;s really a simple piece of software, that i&#39;ve always 
found VERY useful you may not, but not everyone will
care for a less-hassle object placing experience.

Take care, just wanted to update them old rsc server

<p>It’s really a lot less work, because you only have to copy and paste 1 time, versus several.<br>
You also don’t have to risk messing your format up, as this automatically inserts the format.</p>
<p>As I’ve stated though, some will find it useful some will not; don’t use it if you do not care to.</p>
