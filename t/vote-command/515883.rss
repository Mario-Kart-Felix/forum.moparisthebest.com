    <title>::vote command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vote-command/515883</link>
    <description>Oke, i made a vote command probely it looks good.
But i have a webclient (a free 1 on rswebs)
Since its also client bounded, i wonder if there is any way to make it work
if they don&#39;t have the client.
This is my command
&lt;blockquote&gt;}
if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;vote&quot;) || playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;vote4cash&quot;)) {
			c.getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;http://www.runelocus.com/toplist/details-27473-heroicscape.html&quot;, 12000);
			c.sendMessage(&quot;Vote evry 12 hwrs please&quot;);
			}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Well i have no idea what to do, i tried this as well
&lt;blockquote&gt;if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;vote&quot;) || playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;vote4cash&quot;)) {
			launchURL(&quot;http://www.runelocus.com/toplist/details-27473-heroicscape.html&quot;, 12000);
			c.sendMessage(&quot;Vote evry 12 hwrs please&quot;);
			}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But seems like he doesn&#39;t accept that eather i got compileing errors that way
so if anyone knows, it would be realy helpfull 
thank u.</description>
