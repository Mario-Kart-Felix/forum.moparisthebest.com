        <p>If you actually read my comment earlier I did say I had a misconception between illness and disease, meaning I was confused between the two thinking one was the other. Knowing that an illness is a lot less dramatic than a disease (i have a feeling that comment will break into a discussion). I was originally thinking of depression as a disease which is why I was so strong on the point saying people don’t get it as common as people think. But really, I don’t think you guys are understanding what i mean because I’m going over everything I’m saying with facts and backups from studies and research, yet you continue to keep a closed mind belittling everything I say.</p>

        <p>So I guess the thousands of thousands of cognitive psychologist everywhere do their part just for the hell of it? I assume they study these things to make no progress at all? Again, I’ve listen to your point that is supported by facts. But you should know that in psychology there isn’t just one answer, an example of this is nature vs nurture, another is every single approach from behavioral, cognitive, biological, behavioral and humanistic. All psychologist believe in different approach if not all. I pitty your ignorance because you fail to see that psychologists will and forever will disagree. What we’re having right now is some sort of mini Darwin vs Lamarck discussion on my part, and a flame war on yours.</p>

<p>Depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain which involves dopamine so don’t try to say it has nothing to do with depression</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sure, it ‘involves’ Dopamine - because so does basically every other neurological process. That’s like saying every disease ‘involves blood’ - technically correct, but still a bullshit statement. Also, what you said was it’s a ‘drop in dopamine production’ not just ‘involves dopamine’ - which isn’t true at all. That’s Parkinson’s (and related diseases).</p>
<p>You kind of have a good point hidden in the mess, but tone it down on the pop neurology talk &lt;3</p>
<p>EDIT: I should be clearer because that post looks mean - I dig your support for behavioural therapy, but your simplification of the super complex neuro stuff involved with depression is dangerous (and very wrong)</p>

        <p>I wont argue with that because I barely recall half of the key terms I’m supposed to remember so yeah it’s a huge mess. But the jist of what I was saying is that depression is caused by a low concentration of dopamine and schizophrenia is a cause of too much dopemine, which I’m pretty sure is correct minus the terms I’m using in-between.</p>
<p>Also could you care to explain a little more about what I got wrong with the neuro system. I know little about the nervous system, all I really know is the structures and cells involved and what they do.</p>

        <p>It’s not really correct. There’s far more going on in a depressed brain than ‘too little dopamine’. I’m really the wrong person to talk about it, I’m not a neuroscientist either haha. Just a crazy person with an interest. But, basically, yes, we did once think that too low or high levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin were the cause of depression (though even that was more complicated than just ‘not enough of them’) - this was something called the monoamine hypothesis. It’s now discredited, because we’ve realised that it’s far more complicated than that.</p>
<p>We arrived at the monoamine hypothesis basically because, while working on some drugs to treat other stuff (Tuberculosis was a big one, I forget the others) we found that the way these drugs inhibited MAOI’s (basically, the chemicals that break down dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline etc. and remove it from the brain) also helped a lot of people with depression and other diseases that were thought to be purely psychological, like anxiety disorders etc. This led to a sort of big breakthrough moment in medicine where we went 'oh shit, so these depressed people actually have chemical imbalances in the brain? Well that’s easy then, we can fix that with science!’ and we developed drugs like Prozac specifically to target these monoamines and prevent their reuptake (leave more of them lying around in the brain for longer).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after we started using these drugs on people we realised that they aren’t the wonder pill we thought they were. And this basically proved the monoamine hypothesis wrong. If we think of another disease that everyone is familiar with that results from a ‘lack of’ something in the body - say, Diabetes Type 1 (body dramatically reduces production of insulin) or primary hypothyroidism (thyroid gland sucks dick at producing thyroxin) - we can a) measure the deficit, everybody who has these diseases has a measurable lack of something in the body and b) if we replace what they’re missing, with insulin or levothyroxine, we can then measure the improvement - and the patient gets better.</p>
<p>This doesn’t happen with depression and antidepressant drugs (by the way, before someone points out that thyroxine replacement and SSRI’s are not really the same - that’s totally true - serotonin doesn’t really readily/efficiently cross the blood brain barrier, so we can’t just stick serotonin in peoples brains, we have to do fancy things like prevent its reuptake - the brain is sometimes a big of a black box like that. We do the same thing with Parkinsons sometimes, with drugs that inhibit reuptake of dopamine or with MAOI’s) - sometimes people on antidepressants get better, sometimes they don’t, sometimes they get worse, sometimes nothing happens at all. So it’s fairly clear now, that ‘too little serotonin’ or similar statements is not enough to explain the cause. It’s fairly evident that they are a symptom of the ‘actual’ cause - one which may also contribute to further deterioration in a sort of ‘cascade’ effect, but not the ‘root’ cause, if that makes sense. A bit like how if you broke your leg in the desert and were in pain, and then got dehydrated, you’d be in more pain, but lack of water didn’t put you there, the broken leg did… that’s a terrible analogy but I can’t think of a better one right now.</p>
<p>So where does this leave us? The current consensus is that depression is not one disease, but the result of many different things that can go wrong in the brain, and importantly, it’s a process that once started and untreated, leads to chemical and importantly <em>structural</em> changes that continue the progression of the disease - like a death spiral. There are measurable structural (‘physical’) changes in the brains of people with chronic depression, for example the hypothalamus shrinks, neurons die and lose their ability to interact with neurotransmitters properly, and pathways in the brain change and form new functions and behaviours. In a way, depression is a kind of ‘brain damage’, I guess you could say, though I’d be wary of using that term… <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Importantly, these changes have been shown to undo themselves with treatment, <em>and that doesn’t only include drug therapy, but other therapies too</em>. So it’s also not correct to just give up and say ‘oh shit, it’s brain damage, well that guy is fucked’. But it’s clear at this point that it is definitely a ‘disease’.</p>

So from what I’m understanding is that depression starts off as a typical illness where the patient starts to feel sad, where dopemine and serotonin levels decrease, this causes a chemical imbalance where cells start to die and which then, eventually causes depression to become a disease by changing the structure? I have a hard time comprehending things so mind don’t mind me if I’m not getting the point across. It sounds really interesting and I’ll definitely discuss this with my psych teacher if we ever come in contact again. Thanks for the lesson</p>
