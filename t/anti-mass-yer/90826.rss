    <title>Anti Mass... Yer</title>

    <description>Well you guys hate Massing? Yes you do...
Time to make an AntiMassing system.
I have made it on a way... but lets discuss best ways to make it
My suggestion is 
Declare MassTimer as an Public int then in Process add MassTimer-=1;
and in an action add if (MassTimer&gt;=1)

Wouldnt that be a good example?

- Edit i was hoping someone was interested in removing massing? -[br][size=1]Posted on: May 06, 2007, 12:15:13 PM[/size][hr]Sorry for double post.. but i think this is a great problem on many servers so why dont you help?</description>
