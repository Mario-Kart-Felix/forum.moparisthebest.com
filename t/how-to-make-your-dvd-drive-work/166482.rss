    <title>How to make your dvd drive work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-your-dvd-drive-work/166482</link>
    <description>[i][b]This will not work for everyone! It depends on how broken your dvd player is[/b][/i]. Let me explain. Some times when doing a Microsoft update it will download a file that changes the [b]Region[/b] of your dvd player. Now if your dvd drive is a cd/dvd drive combo then it should still play cds and certain dvds even after it has been changed.

This happened to me a few months ago, and up until now i just thought the dvd part of my drive was broken.
However, after doing quite a bit of looking online i found that after a while dvd drives would do the same thing as mine did on occasion. So i did a little research and found that the drive is not totally ruined, but indeed one of microsoft&#39;s updates messed it up. There were a few ways to fix the problem, but a few were very complicated.

The easiest way i found was a program called dvd region free +css. This program lets you play dvds that shouldn&#39;t play on your drive because of the region. It does this by enabling your dvd players (such as windows media player) to play the dvd.

To download Dvd region Go to this link---&gt;[url=http://www.free-codecs.com/download/DVD_Region_CSS_Free.htm]http://www.free-codecs.com/download/DVD_Region_CSS_Free.htm[/url]

This is the only way i have found so far to fix this problem, I hope this helped you.

If you have any questions/Comments please post.</description>
