Application:
I am in need of more coders, and graphic designers for the website as well as anyone who can do custom php work to help take some of the load off me. The server has a good amount of votes on websites and we can also use some people to help advertise, those who help advertise will get special items like donator pins etc. 

The set number of people I need is a dynamic number and I am looking for skilled and professional people to make a great server, that means that thirteen year olds that are just going to say to their friends oh yeah well I am a mod and I have so much power look at me need not apply. I run the server in a professional manner and that is a great assurance for the success of it. Unlike most server owners I know how to run a server, I know how to design websites as can be seen by our website (I do not want to violate forum rules but if you check moparscape vote site its easy to find), I also know Java and what not ofc the issue is I am just one person I have 2 coders atm but they do not have much time and I am looking for a coder(s) who can do pretty much it all or who can do more than just leech some code off a forum post. I will keep the application as easy as I can and you can apply for multiple positions if you want.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Application:
Position apply for:
How long have you been doing this skill:
Age:
Please give or explain some examples of what you have done relating to it:
What will you bring to RuneSoul:
Are you willing to take orders and not goof up on a power craze?:
Do you have Skype, and a mic (not required but helpful):
Anything else we should know?:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you like me are sick of owners that are immature and just run around doing stupid things this is the server for you. We of course have fun but not at the expense of others and this is going to be a great stable server we just need the people to help us get there. To the trolls gtfo of this thread to everyone else I hope you enjoy what you have seen, remember this is just the start and tons of features are always being added. If you have any questions please feel free to ask (constructive only please), there is no minimum age on applying it is more about the maturity level of people, and yes I know this is RuneScape but there are mature people out their. I have the financial backing to make sure this server has time to succeed so to those thinking well I don&#39;t want to apply and then the server goes down the next day I wouldn&#39;t worry much about that. I want a great environment for everyone and all the help I can get is very much appreciated.

Thanks for reading and enjoy!

My main thing is seeing what the ability of coders are and of course building trust with them. If you could show some screenshots of work you have done etc that would be great.</p>
<p>Gizat - if you could give me some examples of your work you have done. I think you may be best suited for a moderator position but I need to know your timezone with that type of thing because we need more mods at the late hours well around 11 EST etc. I can’t say the website link on these forums but google RuneSoul and take a look at the website. First though if you could show some examples of code you have done or screenshots etc that would be nice to help the consideration.</p>
