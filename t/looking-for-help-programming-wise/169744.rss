    <description>I am trying to change stuff on my server. If im going to change something on the server do I have to compile after or something to get the things to work afterword?


And Im looking for a few more things. 


Im looking to learn how to...

1. Remove objects.
2. Add things.
3. Create new zones (already existant ones) Like admin/mod/owner zones.


I also want to know how to...

- Make a portal to Castle Wars. So people can like play CW on my server.

- Make the Fight Caves minigame in my server. With jad as the boss and ect.

- Change what shops sell/prices of items.


- Change the amount of Xp you get when training on like the prayer alter and statue and ect.


I think thats it.. Lol...
