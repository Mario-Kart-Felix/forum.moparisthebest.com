    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-was-this-server-called-will-be-donating/526697</link>
    <description>Okay I know this is pretty irrelevant but I don&#39;t know where else to post this : Can a mod delete once i get a reply please? 

So pretty much this server was the funnest I&#39;ve ever played before my exams , it was a pre eoc pvp server , based in v.bank... Everytime you killed somebody you would get a random drop most likely being rune , or ahrims... But that 1/100 chance of getting like chaotic ext...

This server was really fun + Gano was really fun to play with and it costed pk points only? 
Also had like 20-40 players playing</description>

              <p>I could just give you the source for the donation <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/blush.png?v=5" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"></p>
<p>Only joking (i’ll take that donation though), I recommend you just look through some sites like RL and R-S if you can’t find it in the advertisement section. I’m sure you’ll eventually find it.</p>
