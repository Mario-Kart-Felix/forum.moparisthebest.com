    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/huge-help-please-connecting-to-639-servers-and-clients/440512</link>
    <description>i&#39;ve been trying to switch over to a 639/672 server, im trying to get onto humidityx source right now. ive changed all &#39;127.0.0.1&#39; to my ip, and also have changed the ip in &#39;clientsettings&#39; to my ip.


i have done this with loads of server sources and clients, why can i connect to any of them?


yes my ip is portfrowarded, and am using 43594.
