    <title>[linux]How to add a song or sound to booting up!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/linux-how-to-add-a-song-or-sound-to-booting-up/145698</link>
    <description>well, I just put a freakingly annoying song that would drive anyone insane, but that is just me.
I use Kubuntu, so it may vary.
First of all you need the thing to play it which is Sox
and it only plays Ogg Vorbis as far as I know.
therefore you need to use mp32Ogg if you don&#39;t have it already in OGG

Open up your terminal.
[tt]sudo apt-get -y -f install sox mp32ogg[/tt]
the -y and -f basically make it AFK installation.

after that, you would use 
[tt]mp32ogg /path/to/file.mp3[/tt]
and it will save an 0GG format in the same folder as the original is in, with the same name(not the extension though)

I would use either kdesu kate or sudo nano to edit the configuration file for this
in /etc/rc.local is a configuration file that has custom statements.
before [tt]exit 0[/tt] put a line with [tt]play /path/to/file.ogg[/tt]
(note, this is case sensitive so make sure you got it right)
This file is intentionally used for doing things like this, as you may notice in the comment: 
[code]# By default this script does nothing.[/code]
DO NOT get rid of the &quot;exit 0&quot;!!! this will cause an error!
[code]# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will &quot;exit 0&quot; on success or any other
# value on error.
[/code]

this uses Sox in Root(you don&#39;t need to put in pass or anything), therefore it can only be killed by Super User AKA Root.
This will not stop when logging in, neither does it repeat. 

So If you don&#39;t mind a song whenever you boot up, sure go and do this! otherwise, you can just put a fancy boot sound.</description>
