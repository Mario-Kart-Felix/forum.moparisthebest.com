    <title>How To Get Back On The School Sleeping Schedule In Two Days</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-get-back-on-the-school-sleeping-schedule-in-two-days/133776</link>
    <description>Hey,

     For me, school starts in 5 days, and personally, I&#39;m really not liking the fact that I&#39;m gonna have to goto bed at 11 because school starts at 7. So until the 18th, I&#39;m keeping my regular schedule. Here&#39;s how you can get back on your school sleeping schedule, with a little bit of effort in math.

1.) Wake up when you usually do.
2.) That night, don&#39;t go to sleep, at all. Usually this isn&#39;t hard depending on your sleeping schedule now.
3.) This is the hard part. You gotta stay up, all day. Do whatever you have to do to stay up. For me, caffeine will hold me off for a bit, but the best thing is to put yourself in a position where it&#39;s important to stay up. Don&#39;t go to work like this, very bad idea. I mean things like hanging out with friends out side, walking the dog, make sure your staying active.
4.) Find out what time your going to have to wake up. For me, I have to wake up at 5:30 in the morning, because my bus comes at 6:30. Think about how long you usually sleep for. Don&#39;t try to act cool and say you only sleep for 6 hours, because that will do nothing but make you wake up a few hours early. Well, take your regular sleeping time, and add about 1-2 hours. I sleep an average of 7-8 hours on a normal day, so I&#39;m going to add an hour and make it nine. The reason were doing this, is because your body has been deprived of sleep, and it will make up for it with about 1-2 hours of extra sleep. Well, back on topic, take the number of hours you usually sleep plus 1-2 hours and your time you have to wake up, and subtract the sleep time from the wakeup time. Here&#39;s an example,

I sleep 7-8 hours.
I wake up at 5:30
I will get an extra 1-2 hours so I&#39;m going to sleep 8-9 hours
so, 5:30 - 9 hours.

I&#39;m going to need to goto sleep at 8:30 that night. This may seem to you as childish, and you think that you wouldn&#39;t be able to, and even when the time comes you might think you won&#39;t be able to. But trust me, you get in a comfortable position and close your eyes and YOUR OUT.

This has been tested by me, about mid summer, and then my friends just did it this past week. If I were you, I&#39;d take about 5 days before you go back to school to do this, because you might fall asleep during the day, or just need to get used to waking up at an early hour, but the minimum is 2 days.

Thanks for reading,

This does work, but what doesn’t work is what I did last year right before the FCATS (Big test in Florida), that night before, I stayed up til 7 am, playing Halo 2 on XBOX Live With a friend. It was fun, until I went 2 school, and fell asleep in every class.</p>

<p>Staying awake suggestions:<br>
RedBull (Any type of energy drink)<br>
Coffee<br>
If you just sit there you fall asleep<br>
Make your house very cold…<br>
Go to gas station for caffeine…</p>
