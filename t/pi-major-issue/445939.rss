    <title>[PI] Major Issue!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-major-issue/445939</link>
    <description>I have a major issue on my server. (iQuality Base)

None of the items that I seem to add to UseItem.java seem to have any effect.
Example: I started with a basic item such as a dragonfire shield; in which I added a code as such:

[code]if ((itemUsed == 1540 &amp;&amp; useWith == 11286) || (itemUsed == 11286 &amp;&amp; useWith == 1540)) {
			if (c.playerLevel[c.playerSmithing] &gt;= 95) {
				c.getItems().deleteItem(1540, c.getItems().getItemSlot(1540), 1);
				c.getItems().deleteItem(11286, c.getItems().getItemSlot(11286), 1);
				c.getItems().addItem(11284,1);
				c.sendMessage(&quot;You combine the two materials to forge a dragonfire shield!&quot;);
				c.getPA().addSkillXP(500 * Config.SKILLING_XP, c.playerSmithing);
			} else {
				c.sendMessage(&quot;You need a smithing level of 95 to forge a dragonfire shield.&quot;);
			}
		}[/code]

The code compiles fine, but it still does NOTHING in game. 
The reason why I am asking you all how to fix this is there are so many things to be added that are
dependent on this feature, that are currently broken along with this.
An example is crafting and how it does not work on my server.

If there is anyone out there willing to help or has any advice, please say so. I&#39;m desperate here  :(</description>
