    <title>[PI] Major Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-major-issue/539695</link>
    <description>As I was programming some new stuff for my slayer system I updated the server, compiled it, closed out of the old server, ran the new server, no errors whatsoever.

The only problem is no one can connect to the server via localhost or IP, no oone. As I was just working with NPC IDs basically I don&#39;t know what could be doing this, however I tested with my old source people can join that one perfectly fine.

Is there something I could have changed to prevent me (or anyone else for that matter) of getting online?..</description>
