    <title>Loading higher interface ids</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/loading-higher-interface-ids/463371</link>
    <description>I was wondering, what extensions to a 317 client are made to load higher id interfaces? I&#39;ve run into an out-of-bounds issue with adding a higher id. I thought by editing the varp.dat to load more ids would solve problem, but it wasn&#39;t.</description>
