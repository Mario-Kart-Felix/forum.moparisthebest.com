    <title>Point Shop Help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/point-shop-help/423209</link>
    <description>Hey, So I added a point shop and basically my points are called premium points. Now the problem is I also have another point shop called explicity points shop and when you click and item value it says this item currently cost 100 premium points in the explicity points shop how do I change this. I cant find the shop in shopassistant to change it the shop id is 18 for the explicity points and I can&#39;t find it anywhere.

Help Please?

Thanks, Mr Rushed</description>
