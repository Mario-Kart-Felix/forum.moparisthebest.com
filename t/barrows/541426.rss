    <description>Hello guys, I was adding barrows and I was wondering

In Runescape the heads of the barrow NPCs would sometimes get onto your screen. I was wondering are there perhaps codes for these &#39;interfaces&#39; if not how would I use them? 


edit: can&#39;t find them on any interface list.</description>
