    <description>Having the lunar altar is a waste of space
how can i make it so an option comes with you click the Ancient altar asking you Switch Magics to

--&gt; Normal
--&gt;Ancient
--&gt;Lunar

and make it actaully work.

---------------------
Blacks a very good idea!

Well i see in alot of servers, the server has no control, like when the owner or any other staff are offline, Ppl seem to think its ok to break rules, I was thinking of blackmarks.

Spamming = 2.0

Annoying staff = 1.5

Bug abuse = 3.0

The total should be (5) Blackmarks and instant Ban,
i got some of it in my head, but need help in parts like:

The server detects your abusing bugs (Glitching) and imports your name into a Glitch.txt file

and all the same for the other rules,
if your name shows up once you get (depending on what rule they have broken)
eg. spamming they get 2.0 again they get 4.0 and last warning ingame it could say
[code]
sM(&quot;You have gained yourself +blackmarks+&quot;);and the warning[/code]
[code]
sM(&quot;WARNING: You have over 4 BlackMarks, get one more and you&#39;ll get Banned.&quot;)&#39;So can anyhelp help me?[/code]</description>
