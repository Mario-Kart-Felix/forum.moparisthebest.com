    <title>Project king c r 0 w n v1!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-king-c-r-0-w-n-v1/131172</link>
    <description>Hello , I am king c r 0 w n and I am going to start a project. There will be a lot to add to the server to improve it but that will be easy if all of us work together. My server is basically Project 16 but we&#39;re going to make it into something new. Things I want to add : PC , CWARS , Specails , Double shooting ogre comp , and that&#39;s all I got for now. What I have added : Redmask+dmed to make a D Full - creds to frugoo scape , adding all animations for the mage attacks, made all rares rare , took out the stupid ::bomb command.There will be a lot of spots open which will be : Website maker , tester , admin , mod , website designer , idea maker , coders , and even client coders.

Site : Still not made
Forum : Frugoo is making pmg?!

Percent done with server : 10 % Will be updated time to time.

Admin - Will be a loyal player to play the server to see if anyone is abusing their power or if anyone is breaking rules [may kick and ban if need]

Moderator - Will do the same as administator but no banning ^.^

Tester - After a coder has made a code and I have added it 100 percent correctly they will test if the code works.

Idea Maker - Will make idea&#39;s for the coder to make. All idea&#39;s must be approved by me -  doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s on msn , over the game , in pm , just has to be accepted.

Website Maker - Will make a forums for the server and will make it all sexy looking xD

Website Designer - Will add on the forums - backrounds , logos , ect.

Coders - Must be experienced and know what your doing or else we&#39;re screwed 

Client Maker - makes a client for the server to run on
