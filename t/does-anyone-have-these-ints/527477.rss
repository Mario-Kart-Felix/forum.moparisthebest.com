    <title>Does anyone have these Ints?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anyone-have-these-ints/527477</link>
    <description>I want to be able to have 2 stacks of coins, so I&#39;m going to try to have coins as a &quot;custom item&quot;. If anyone has the itemDef ints (if you have the class8 ones, that&#39;s fine), please post them here. 

I don&#39;t know if this is the right section; I don&#39;t post much here. Sorry if it&#39;s wrong.</description>
