    <title>[PI] Skill animations [PI]</title>

    <description>Ok, I&#39;ve asked this a couple of times but I was in another state, and I just got home, and I couldn&#39;t find my question, so I&#39;ll ask it again.

When you do a skill, like fishing, you do an animation which is bending down to put the net in the water. Well, if you walk away while doing this, you&#39;re STILL doing this while you walk. It stops when you teleport, but this annoys the hell out of me. Any ideas?</description>
