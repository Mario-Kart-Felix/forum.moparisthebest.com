    <description>Sup guys.

So i&#39;m making a new method for doors, etc. And i have all methods etc etc prepared, just one thing is stopping me from making this awesome system.

[FINDING THE STATE OF WHICH WAY THE OBJECT IS FACING]

Okay, so inside the first click object packet, i have tried to create an int for it, but i have tried the following and NONE of them worked:

[code]
	    int i1 = inStream.readDWord();
            int i2 = inStream.readDWord_v1();
            int i3 = inStream.readDWord_v2();
            long i4 = inStream.readQWord();
            long i5 = inStream.readQWord2();
            int i6 = inStream.readSignedByte();
            int i7 = inStream.readSignedByteA();
            int i8 = inStream.readSignedByteC();
            int i9 = inStream.readSignedByteS();
            int i10 = inStream.readSignedWord();
            int i11 = inStream.readSignedWordA();
            int i12 = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();
            int i13 = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndianA();
            int i14 = inStream.readUnsignedByte();
            int i15 = inStream.readUnsignedByteA();
            int i16 = inStream.readUnsignedByteC();
            int i17 = inStream.readUnsignedByteS();
            int i18 = inStream.readUnsignedWord();
            int i19 = inStream.readUnsignedWordA();
            int i20 = inStream.readUnsignedWordBigEndian();
            int i21 = inStream.readUnsignedWordBigEndianA();
[/code]
