    <title>Port-forward problems. Asisstance required</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forward-problems-asisstance-required/183580</link>
    <description>Well, I have done everything I possibly can to get my server working. Following all the tutorials I managed to get my portforwarding finished, although... my server is still not working.

My only thought is that it is not properly port-forwarded.

when i made the port, i had all the options described in the tutorial as well as a &#39;port map&#39; section, which i was unsure what to enter in there.

Also, my portforward section for my router is rather unusual with a strange layout, I am unsure what is wrong.

I would appreciate some help.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 21, 2008, 08:52:25 AM[/size][hr]I&#39;ll post a pic, gimmie a sec.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 21, 2008, 08:58:06 AM[/size][hr][IMG]http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd54/Tom10846/portforward.jpg[/img][br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 21, 2008, 10:03:58 AM[/size][hr]There is the picture, what do i put in the port map? :S</description>
