    <title>Store owner shoots robber - with video</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/store-owner-shoots-robber-with-video/346923</link>
    <description>http://www.fox8.com/news/wjw-elyria-robbery-txt,0,6139707.story

&lt;blockquote&gt;The man eventually succeeded in getting through the door in the drive-thru, but the owner had a surprise for him, a gun she carries in her hip pocket.

She tells Fox 8 &quot;I reacted as fast as I could, trying to put a barrier between him and I saw him breaking through that door and I shot him.&quot;

Once the tables have been turned on the bandit, he ran away.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I always read RSS feeds from this site:
http://www.thearmedcitizen.com/
But this one in particular I liked because of the clear video, and it happened in the same state I live in.

Anyway, it would have been better if the robber was killed, but he probably learned a valuable lesson anyway, anyone could be armed so DON&#39;T THREATEN THEM WITH A GUN UNLESS YOU WANT TO DIE.

And before you spew bullshit like &quot;if she just did what he asked no one would have been hurt&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The owner says she decided to get a permit to carry the gun after the June 2008 murder of a clerk at a gas station in Elyria. In that case, the clerk was killed, even though she complied with all of the robber&#39;s demands.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Exactly.</description>

<p>The larger gangs will always have access to guns, regardless. However I am talking about small-time people, much like the man in this video, who wouldn’t normally have access to a gun that thinks that it would be easy to use it for control.</p>
<p>The point of a firearm is to have control over a situation, what is the point if everyone has control? Surely it would be better to have an authority in control, such as hey, a policeman. Look at the gun-crime in the UK for example, very little, compared to, for example, las vegas where I got off the plane, took a journey to my hotel and saw two guns and several more suspicious people.</p>
<p>I would want to live in a place where I knew I could walk down the street without fear of having a gun pointed at me, with a knife I’ve got a good chanceto run away, however with a gun that is not the case.</p>

<p>The scenario presented by the movie is realistic, however. The reality is that crimes of passion involve killing a person who trusts you, and is thus prepared to turn their back on you (giving your the opportunity to improve your K/D ratio).</p>

<p>Can commit those with a knife while your partner is sleeping. Or with scissors, which the guy was going to do to his wife when he caught her cheating on him in the film Minority Report.</p>
<p>For example (I don’t think it really counts as a crime of passion): One of the characters in the film Ken Park kills his two grandparents while they’re sleeping by stabbing them in the heart with a knife.</p>
<p>Your point is silly, because crimes of passion are the EASIEST crimes to commit with a weapon other than a firearm; the victim is someone that trusts you.</p>

<blockquote>

</aside>
<p>You just said that access to guns makes people become criminals?  No.  A criminal will break the law with whatever is available, the only reason they would consider not breaking the law is if there is a distinct possibility they could end up dead, like if law abiding citizens are able to carry guns.  And again, a criminal will get a gun regardless of whether it is legal or not.</p>
<p>As to this ‘waiting period’ debate raging above me, it’s different in each state in the USA.  Where I live in Ohio, there is no waiting period whatsoever for any type of firearm.  We have to pass a criminal background check (fill out a form, the gun dealer calls it into BATF) but then we walk out of the store with the gun, and whatever else we want to buy, including ammo.  Also, crime is very low in this state compared to others nearby, like Illinois.</p>
<p>It is probable that in some states there is a waiting period on ALL firearms, and in some there is only a waiting period on handguns.  It’s really a mute point though.</p>
