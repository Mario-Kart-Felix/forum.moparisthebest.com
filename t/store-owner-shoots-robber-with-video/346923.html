But this one in particular I liked because of the clear video, and it happened in the same state I live in.</p>
<p>Anyway, it would have been better if the robber was killed, but he probably learned a valuable lesson anyway, anyone could be armed so DON’T THREATEN THEM WITH A GUN UNLESS YOU WANT TO DIE.</p>
<p>And before you spew bullshit like “if she just did what he asked no one would have been hurt”:</p>
<blockquote>The owner says she decided to get a permit to carry the gun after the June 2008 murder of a clerk at a gas station in Elyria. In that case, the clerk was killed, even though she complied with all of the robber's demands.</blockquote>
<p>Exactly.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Where are these stories?  People who are going to commit crimes, like shooting innocent people, are going to do it regardless of whether guns are legal or not.  The only possible deterrent to them is the risk of being killed by law abiding citizens with legal guns.</p>

You gotta wait 3 days before you actually get it though, hoping that you don’t act out of impulse. Should be longer, I want 6 months.</p>
<p>If guns are outlawed i hope cars are to. Its just as easy to drive a car through a school parking lot as it is to have another school shooting. In fact, i think the car would kill more kids. Same goes for driving your car into a big mall.</p>

Another happy ending. Stories like these are good, because they provide reasonable grounds for argument.</p>
<p>As I learned from a friend, the second that you bring up the weapons-usage side of firearms, rather than the fact that they are tools for various trades such as hunting or sport, you lose the battle. This is because most Australians are brought up to both fear and loathe firearms in today’s Australia, which means people like me (I do target shooting, for example) are treated like second class citizens.<br>
[/quote]That’s a fucking good thing. It’s thanks to the common negative attitude towards firearms in Sweden guncrimes are so rare.[/quote]<br>
Crime is crime, whether it is committed with a gun or not.  “gun crime” is a useless statistic, like me saying there are less European cars on the road here in the USA than in Europe, to which you would say ‘obviously’.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I feel sorry for the people of Sweden then, where little old ladies and weak people have no way of defending themselves against strong criminals.</p>

People who are going to commit crimes, like shooting innocent people, are going to do it regardless of whether guns are legal or not.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>What? Guns are illegal in the UK and that prevents the vast majority of people getting their hands on one. If I wanted to go and shoot an innocent I wouldn’t know the first place to look for a gun, whereas if they were legal I’d just go to the gun store.[/quote]</p>
<p>You aren’t a criminal.  If you were, you would know how to get a gun to use for your crime.  Criminals do use guns in the UK, it’s just the law-abiding citizen that can’t use one to defend himself or his family.</p>

<p>THAT depends on what state you are in.  Here in Ohio I can go to a store and buy a gun whenever I feel like, I fill out a form, pass a federal background check (they call the form into a national hotline), pay the money, and walk out with a gun a short time later.  We are legally allowed to open-carry a loaded handgun (carry it in full view of others, like an outside holster) without a license, and allowed to concealed carry a loaded handgun with a license after passing a thorough background check and taking a 12-hour safety class (10 hours of classroom instruction, 2 hours of shooting range instruction).</p>
<p>Unlike anti-gun nuts would have you believe, there are no shootouts on the street, mass panic, bullets flying through the air near your house and kids.  In fact since the concealed carry law was passed crime has dropped steadily, criminals ARE afraid of armed victims.  Most of the crime left in Ohio are in cities where the city government is fighting the state government in court because they don’t want to allow concealed carry, cities like Columbus, Cleveland and Toledo.  Luckily I live far away from them.</p>

<p>Are you saying that a gun is the only way that anyone can defend themselves against some guy who works out at the gym? Nice.</p>

        <p>The difference is, thanks to the rarity of gun crime in the UK, the large majority feel safe on the streets without feeling the need to carry a gun due to being statistics being wayyyyyyyy in their favour.</p>
<p>If Gun crime was at a point in the UK where people felt that they were in danger of being a victim of it, then you would not see pretty much the entire british membership of this forum agreeing with the laws of the UK in regards to guns. I’m 19 years old, in that 19 years I have never seen a real gun with exception to those carried by police which is thanks to those laws.</p>
<p>There is no justification at all for introducing such laws that are in the US for the UK. Would I say the similar laws found in the UK should be introduced into the US? No, like i said in another topic, I’d probably want to carry a gun for protection in the US too.</p>
