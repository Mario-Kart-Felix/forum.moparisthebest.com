The man eventually succeeded in getting through the door in the drive-thru, but the owner had a surprise for him, a gun she carries in her hip pocket.

tl;dr - ownt[/quote]</p>
<p>I had 2 lengthy rebuttals written out but jesus christ these statistics are bad. Get some that aren’t 15 years old and aren’t extremely biased. I mean seriously, they paint a pretty picture about muggers setting out to kill other people but only a tiny percent of them get injured? When a huge percent of incidents attackers outnumbered people?</p>
<p>It seems extremely likely that they’re fudging the facts up to fit their arguments. E.G., it seems they present an argument similar to:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">I was being robbed by someone with a knife, they almost certainly would have killed me if I didn’t have a gun to defend myself</span></p>
<p>but what is actually happening is</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">I was being robbed by someone with a knife, they almost certainly would have killed me <span class="bbcode-b">at the point where I didn’t comply and started fighting back</span> if I didn’t have a gun to defend myself</span></p>
<p>It’s not exactly what the page is saying but I hope you see where I’m coming from, statistics like these are very meaningless without some form of context.</p>
<p>EDIT:seems I took so long replying that 3 people had a chance to post !!</p>

ITT we use 16 year old statistics to back up stupid arguments<br>
[/quote]<br>
So what? Not much has changed. 1995 isn’t much different than now. Its not like its 1960.[/quote]</p>
<p>So use newer, more appropriate statistics? It’s bad practice to use something that could be out of context to help your argument.</p>

<p>That’s exactly it. First rule of real life is that you’re up shit creek the second that you presume something bad won’t happen to you. It’s almost as if somebody upstairs really does want to fuck with you, just because you think you’re invincible.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that this is the case for a lot of people who have posted. The ever-so-prevalent ‘it won’t happen to me’ attitude is as detrimental as the classic ‘she’ll be right’ attitude that Australians exhibit (which is why our country is going to shit).</p>

        <p>I’m not a scared kitty kat who thinks he gets robbed daily. I don’t need a gun to feel safe. I trust the cops to keep most of the serious criminals out of my way. Sure, you can have a gun to protect yourself from pickpockets, but most rob you when you are standing in a big crowd. You have to be a big piece of shit when you start shooting in such a situation. Besides, the odds are really small that I get pickpocket-ed. There’s something called ‘not being a fucking idiot’ that allows you to think straight and put your wallet somewhere where pickpockets won’t be able to grab it easily.</p>
<p>So I don’t need a gun to feel safe in my house, I don’t need one to protect myself against pickpockets (who’s going to shoot a pickpocket anyway?). So, why would I need a gun?</p>
<p>Ah, yes! I might get robbed in the middle of the night while walking down the street! Lothy, do you really think that in the situation you described, you’d stand a chance even if you had a gun? Just think about it for a second: You are legally allowed to carry a gun. That would mean that the robbers probably have one too. Even if they are not legally allowed to carry one. If gun-laws are eased, the market for guns will increase rapidly. Illegal guns will be dumped, and legal guns will be stolen. What’s better then killing someone with a gun that’s registered by someone else?</p>

<p>I see this tactic used so often by anti-gun people, and I’m amazed every time I do, I can’t believe it:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">You don’t need a gun, if you just do what the robber/mugger/rapist says you won’t be hurt.</span></p>
<p>Tell that to this gas station clerk and her family:</p>
<blockquote>The owner says she decided to get a permit to carry the gun after the June 2008 murder of a clerk at a gas station in Elyria. In that case, the clerk was killed, even though she complied with all of the robber's demands.</blockquote>
<p>Or perhaps to your mother, wife, or girlfriend you should explain to them if anyone tries to rape them, just comply with their demands and they probably won’t be hurt, right?</p>
<p>No thanks.  In too many documented cases even people that do comply fully with demands get killed without a single thought.  I’ve even seen videos where a robber walks right into a gas station, up to the employee, and just shoots them without saying a word.  The fact is there are some cold blooded, sick people out there and the police aren’t going to get there in time to save you MOST of the time.  You have a God-given right to defend yourself and your family, you should use it.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I hate to agree with Frell on this point, but I have to say I do.  It’s the same with people around here that don’t grow up around guns.  My brother’s girlfriend is the same way, she sees a gun and gets scared, and doesn’t feel safe at all around them.  Truth is there is nothing to be scared about from a gun, it’s just a tool, and, like most tools, is completely safe if handled with care and used correctly, but has the potential to hurt you if not.  (think saws, drills, nail guns, hammers, screw drivers etc etc etc…)  If you raise children like I was raised, teaching them about guns, and teaching them to never touch one without parental supervision, they will never be afraid when they see one, and they won’t try to play with it like a toy.</p>
<p>This fact is illustrated well in another good saying: “Guns don’t kill people, people kill people.”  A gun by itself has never killed anyone in the history of the world, it’s the person behind it that does any killing.</p>

<p>As stated before, cops aren’t going to get there in time to help you out.  Also, no one is going to use a gun to prevent being pick-pocketed, it is used when your life is in imminent danger and as a last resort.</p>

</aside>
<p>Just think about this:  Whether guns are legal or not, the robbers would probably have them, since they are criminals and by definition don’t care about the law.  The difference is that when illegal, only criminals have guns, not law-abiding citizens that would never hurt anyone with a gun, and when legal, criminals will still have them of course, even though it’s illegal for them to own one, and law-abiding citizens will have them to protect themselves from the aforementioned criminals.  Otherwise the law-abiding citizens don’t have a chance.</p>

        <p>Now, moparisthebest: You have one opinion that sticks through in every post: All criminals carry guns because they don’t care about the law. It is such a ridiculous thing to say, because not everyone is a psychopath. Millions of people shoplift, millions of people pirate software, both groups do completely different things and surely every individual has his own limits?</p>
<p>The vast majority of criminals wouldn’t dare to carry a gun here due to the harsh sentences involved.</p>
<p>My point being, you can’t just say “criminals are like this and they do that because they don’t care about the law”, because it makes no sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I just want to add that making guns illegal in the US wouldn’t work, so i’m not arguing that at all. I’m just saying there are tons of countries that wouldn’t benefit at all from having guns legalized and easily accessible. It’s kinda like alcohol: illegal in saudi-arabia and works fine there, but if made illegal here, it would create chaos.</p>

<p>Well it doesn’t. I’ve never been in need of a gun, thanks to the very few amount of maniacs given access to guns in this country. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

</aside>
<p>I’ve only felt like I might need to use my gun one time, when a maniac almost ran me off the road and then proceeded to chase me, in the dark, with his lights off, about 2 feet from my bumper at 60+mph, for about 25 miles in the country.  I actually called 911 (the emergency number for the police) but the operator was a bitch and told me that if I wanted to pull over in the next town (~10 miles down the road) and wait then she could have a sheriff deputy meet me there, like I could actually pull over with this maniac chasing me.  I kept on driving and eventually the maniac turned off and I never saw him again, but if he had wrecked us or ran me off the road I have no doubt I would have had to at least pull my gun on him.</p>
<p>Otherwise I’ve never had to use it and I hope I never come into a situation when I have to, as in this video above.  But the reality is you never know and I’d much rather be safe then sorry.  Why do motorcyclists wear helmets?  It’s not because they expect to crash, it’s just in case.  Why do you turn the electricity off at the breaker box when you go to wire in a new switch, plug, or light?  You still use an insulated screwdriver so you shouldn’t get shocked regardless, but you do it just in case.  That’s the same reason I carry a gun, or at least keep one in the house.</p>
<p>[quote=“Speljohan, post:57, topic:346923”]Now, moparisthebest: You have one opinion that sticks through in every post: All criminals carry guns because they don’t care about the law. It is such a ridiculous thing to say, because not everyone is a psychopath. Millions of people shoplift, millions of people pirate software, both groups do completely different things and surely every individual has his own limits?</p>
<p>The vast majority of criminals wouldn’t dare to carry a gun here due to the harsh sentences involved.</p>
<p>My point being, you can’t just say “criminals are like this and they do that because they don’t care about the law”, because it makes no sense whatsoever.[/quote]</p>
<p>Then maybe I should say ‘violent criminals’, obviously I’m not saying that your average software pirate or a pick pocket would carry a gun.  But someone planning to rob a bank, home, or even person certainly would.  A rapist would.  A serial killer would.  Those crimes all carry punishments far beyond the ‘harsh sentences’ involved with illegally carrying a gun, and anyone that is going to do those wouldn’t think twice about using a gun.</p>

That’s a good question, I don’t know how to stop people from becoming violent criminals, I guess if there was a solution the world would be a much better place all over.  I do know of a solution to lower the amount of crimes committed however.  As stated before, criminals are not afraid of breaking laws or the sentences associated with them, the ARE afraid of dying however, which makes them afraid of armed citizens.  In states/cities where it is illegal to possess firearms, there is basically no danger of encountering an armed victim, so more crime happens.  In states/cities where law-abiding citizens can get a concealed carry license, every day more of them are issued and therefore every day the chance that an attackers intended victim is armed increases, criminals dislike this and either don’t commit the crime or go someplace else where guns are outlawed.</p>
