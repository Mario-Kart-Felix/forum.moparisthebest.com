    <title>Does it work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-it-work/154057</link>
    <description>Well while sitting in biology, bored shitless because i hate biology class... i suddenly had a thought:
What if you put two mirror opposite to each other both exactly parallel to each other, and then shined some sort of light source at one mirror and then took the light source out..... would the light just keep hitting each mirror and bouncing back to the other?

e.g.:
|                                 |
|                                 |
|   &lt;-------light             |
|                                 |
|                                 |
mirror                          mirror 2

|                                 |
|                                 |
|   &lt;-------------------&gt; |
|                                 |
|                                 |
mirror                          mirror 2

ideas? philosophy? post away...</description>

Not at all.  Perpetual motion implies that perfectly efficient work is being done by some force and that energy is being “consumed”.  In our light example, there is no work being done since light is pure energy (has no “mass”, though this one can be argued).  Light <span class="bbcode-b">does</span> go on forever if there is nothing in its path.  Thus, perpetual motion does not apply.<br>

<p>Well perpetual motion assumes ideal situations.  It isn’t necessarily accelerating, so no force is required to keep it moving.  In the real world, there’s gravity and intermolecular forces.  Same with the light example.  In theory it is possible for light to bounce infinitely many times between mirrors.  In actuality, mirrors are never perfect, dust particles deflect light rays, air itself bends light rays.  So I agree with Exception in saying this is similar to a perpetual motion machine.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ll give you that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  I was thinking more along the lines of a perpetual mechanical motion, which does indeed violate the laws of physics.  While large gravitational forces can indeed affect the path traveled by light (in flat 3-space only though…if you consider the universe as curved four-space, the light actually travels in a straight path…its just the spacial “medium” which is curved), light does not slow down because of this.  But prorogation through different materials does indeed altar the speed of light.</p>
<p>However, consider the scenario where light (preferably low-frequency) is traveling in free space and there is nothing in its path.  Would it not continue moving on forever?  Thus would this not also be perpetual motion?  Note, this is not necessarily an ideal scenario since you are maintaining the properties of the universe but are simply giving it a clear path - it is hypothetical though, obviously.</p>

<p>You sound like a Pythagorean saying that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  I never personally saw the existence of irrational numbers as being a flaw or imperfection in our world.  Also, viewing irrational number like pi as being imperfect compared to integers or rational numbers (numbers that can be expressed at the ratio of integers) isn’t quite right imo since pi can be expressed perfectly.  There are many definitions for pi expressed as integrals, infinite sums, or simply the ratio of a circle’s circumference to diameter.  It is in this way that one can consider pi a “perfect” or at least “perfectly defined” number and simply use the symbol in calculations instead of the numeric approximation.  But I’m going way off topic…</p>

</aside>
<p>When rays of light hit your skin, my understanding is that the energy causes atoms and electrons to vibrate.  As it hits an electron, the electron jumps up energy levels, then comes back down, releasing energy in the form of light (infrared and visible… this is why your skin is colored the way it is).  It could also make the nuclei vibrate, and the movement of matter is heat.  I’m probably wrong in some of the semantics, but you know how it is.</p>

<p>Because you see the room being light, that means some photons are hitting your retina.  Also, your body is continually soaking up those photons.

I find it annoying that nothing is 100% efficient.</p>
<p>Also even if you filled a room with mirrors the mirrors wouldn’t be 100% reflective and would absorb some of the light. So no, you can’t turn on a light bulb and watch the light bounce between the mirrors. That’s a really stupid idea.<br>

<p>That was kind of my point. How does the OP’s idea work, but not mine?[/quote]<br>
No, if mine didn’t work then yours wouldn’t work. We are mostly talking about if everything is perfect, but ofcourse nothing is ever perfect (as i said take a flat surface for instance, with the naked eye it would appear to be completely flat but it isnt completely straight because a few atoms would be out… but to the naked eye it would just appear flat, if you get what i mean).</p>
<p>Also goatee; i find that annoying to that nearly nothing is ever perfect too, thinking about the circumference of circles and about how pi can never be found. Ever since i was taught about pi at school its made me look at everything else in a different perspective.</p>
<p>So does anyone else have any theorys (like mine i had with the two mirrors?)</p>

              <p>Well the light would bounce back and forth but only for a while. For example if you have mirrors in your bathroom that open outward so they face each other look at your reflection. It gradually gets dimmer as light diffuses then its just darkness. Light is not magical insofar as it will go back and forth in a straight line forever. So when you turn the light source off the light in the mirrors disappears pretty quick. I dunno if I explained tat right.</p>

<p>That was kind of my point. How does the OP’s idea work, but not mine?</p>

</aside>
<p>because the speed of light is fast so it dissipates quickly being absorbed into the walls and heating them slightly so it is no longer light but heat in the walls. What i don’t understand is if energy is not created or destroyed surely all the energy ever produced would slowly make everything vibrate and cause earthquakes etc?</p>
<p>oh yeah and a good way to line it up would be with a 1 sided mirror or whatever there called but this would simply heat up the mirror.</p>
