    <title>Another nooby question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/another-nooby-question/251708</link>
    <description>Ok i recently added a few customs into my client and server. I dont know why, but for some reason they have pretty random requirements for most of them. I was wondering how i could change it. If it was something in the class8 or if it was something server side. If someone could just tell me what to search for it would be appreciated.</description>
