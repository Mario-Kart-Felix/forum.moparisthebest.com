    <title>Prayers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/prayers/525813</link>
    <description>first of all, i dont know if this would be server of client side, so i just posted here, can be moved if in the wrong section.

so when i first downloaded my server it came with normal prayers but piety had been replaced with turmoil.
now i want to remove turmoil and add piety. i know how to change the sprites etc etc, but i want to change what the prayer does when activated.

could someone explain how to do this please?</description>
