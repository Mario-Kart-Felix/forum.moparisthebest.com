    <description>Well since anyone I ask on msn wont say anything and pups isnt around anymore, does anyone know the general pusedo code of the boxsolver.dll by pups? we managed to do everything that srl does for the box solver more effciently(like acutally getting the flat side the first time it shows), but i have no clue on how to process a rotated object with deformaties. if anyone has an idea on how pups did it that would be very apperciated. or for a way to contact pups so i could message him.</description>

<p>Ok. Thanks for that tip. We found the array, figured the encoding (surprisingly easy) and we now have a full anti stange box random :). So, thankyou for that tip</p>

memory is generally not a issue when running large amounts of bots in the same jvm, cpu is the issue.  It is easier to understand the client when you work for the company that wrote it.</p>

              <p>lol.</p>
<p>I just reread my post and noticed that I inadvertantly smacked you with that blanket statement. While you have a point that they could change the index to 312, keep in mind that I had to look it up as any good system would not rely on a static number. The only thing it needs to know is that <em>a</em> value changes and when the value change notification comes in, if it is within the valid range, it is accepted, otherwise it is discarded.</p>
<p>You have a point with ‘unsolvable’. I should have qualified that. As an aside, have you ever said something knowing full well what you meant, but wanted to get it out and in the process left out a validating point? There is nothing that is impossible. Everything is possible given infinite time and patience. My threshold is much lower than infinite. I call things ‘unsolvable’ or ‘impossible’ if it is past my threshold. Is it vain? Sure. Do I care? Nope.</p>
<p>As for my critical nature? It’s a weakness of mine. I didn’t mean to critique you, personally, it just came out that way. I have obvious reasons for rejecting any form of OCR. The main reason is that there would be no possible way to do with OCR what is being done with internal systems. ie… 2-8% cpu utilization, 50+ bots per system, high efficiency, high volume, etc. When I say no way, in this sense I mean it. The game itself limits you. In a nutshell, you or anyone else from what I have seen, will never be able to have a pure ocr solution that can run more than a menial number of bots on the same system. The cpu and resource usage is just too high.</p>
<p>Next question about releasing my work. I am under an NDA that restricts me from speaking too much about any possible system I may or may not have written. But, not being able to talk to really anyone about what I do, I enjoy ‘checking up’ on various other sites to find out if anyone has progressed to a point that would require me to make any significant changes to my system.</p>
<p>I have not seen anything worrying yet. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

I’ll tell you exactly why I prefer my hammer to any pair of pliers or wrench you can provide. Simply, I get more joy out of writing a computer vision algorithm (however basic it is) then a simple decoding of an integer value in the client. I have a good reason for this, at least I think it is a good reason, I welcome yours: while Jagex could very well change the graphical design of the box, wouldn’t it be easier to change the strange box index to 313, or any other value for that matter? It makes more sense to me to make something that is harder for them to break.</p>
<p>Also, I’m sure you mistyped when you called something unsolvable; as I’m sure you know that anything is possible if you’re willing to put the time and effort into it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> As you are so critical of other people’s work, why not show off some of your own work which, no doubt, is millions of years beyond the rest of us, and as that may be, you might refuse just to keep our heads from exploding while trying to comprehend it.</p>
<p>Once again, I’m surprised that you consider this a lot of work. It took me all of two, maybe three, afternoons as a side project because I was bored and decided to do someone a favor. Please take the time to consider that, just because your way is superior to all others, someone might want to do it differently just for the experience. While I use my hammer to screw a bolt into concrete, you continue to use your surgical scalpel to cut the crust off of your, precisely measured, peanut butter and jelly sandwich, prepared at exactly 56.7 degrees fahrenheit. Have fun with that sandwich <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>P.S. Thanks for the support, I don’t know what we would ever do without you. I guess we would have to invent fire all by ourselves.</p>

<p>Is that the “random” array Pplsuqbawlz was telling me about?</p>
<p>Thankyou for that tip semaphore. I shall begin looking for the array now <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<blockquote>My current idea is to find the biggest piece of white. That i can do. Take the area of the white. That i can do. 
<p>Then i know the shape in theory. (lol)</p>
<p>Now for the orc.</p>
<p>I was thinking of taking every point in the number and comparing it to the other numbers, find the 2 points that are furtest away from each other in terms of distance transversed while staying the the letter.</p>
<p>ex:<br>
Code:<br>
*xx<br>
x<br>
ox<br>
x<br>
*xx</p>
<p>to get from * to * every X is tranversed and added to the distance. The o is not transvered</p>
<p>Distance = 8;<br>
dx = 4, dy =0</p>
<p>So now in theory we have a better idea of how the number is aligned.</p>
<p>The rest i am stilling thinking about.</p>
<p>Any suggestions? any critisms?</p>

              <p>Well, the basic approach that he took was thus:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the largest single color area, assume that is the shape</li>
<li>Find the edge of that area, that is the outline of that shape</li>
<li>Count the number of vertecies on the shape, you now know what the shape is (I know a way to do this, but it dosen’t look like its what pups did)</li>
<li>Assume that the only other color area within the shape is the number</li>
<li>Find the border of that colored area (the number)</li>
<li>I’m a bit sketchy on how to continue from here and will have to think on it more… But, basicly you determin the number from the outline that you have.</li>

<p>Assuming that this is for java, I might be able to write a mock up box solver over the next couple of days, everything minus the numbers anyway.</p>
