    <title>Help with ::buy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-buy/285500</link>
    <description>Before all the flaming starts - i tried searching for the last hour, search either returns no results or the same thread which just gives me an error..

I&#39;m using the ::buy command from n00bscape for EasyRSC. Currently, all players can use ::buy, which is what i want. However, i only want them to be able to buy Runes and Arrows in mass quantities, so they don&#39;t sit and click away for hours on end. I don&#39;t want them to be able to buy anything else. How would i change the command so there is only an array of items they can buy, instead of anything?

Help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance, any help would be appreciated.</description>
