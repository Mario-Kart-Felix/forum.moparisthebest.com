    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;LEXINGTON, Ga. -- Preliminary autopsy results show that an ex-UGA professor and his wife apparently were killed by dogs, according to officials.

&quot;Preliminary findings indicate both of the individuals died as a consequence of mauling injuries,&quot; State Medical Examiner Dr. Kris Sperry confirmed to Channel 2 Action News.

Channel 2 Action News reporter Tom Regan took pictures of several of the wild dogs believed to be responsible for the attack.

Authorities said the couple found dead by Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses along a road in rural Oglethorpe County Saturday morning were 77-year-old Lothar Karl Schweder and his wife, 65-year-old Sherri L. Schweder.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
