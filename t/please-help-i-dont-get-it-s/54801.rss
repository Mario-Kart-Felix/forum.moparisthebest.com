    <description>Hey, i am the co-owner of rs3revolutionpk and the server has just been advertised and was going great, but now, when i try to open any batch file. e.g. runserver, compile, it says &quot;another program is currently using this file&quot;.
But the thing is, no other program is using it lol, so how am i supposed to run the server?
Thanks. :o
