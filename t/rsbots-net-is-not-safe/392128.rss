    <title>RSbots.net is not safe</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsbots-net-is-not-safe/392128</link>
    <description>Just a warning to anyone who uses rsbots.net&#39;s bot client, I&#39;m just about 100% sure it was used to get my password. About 120m in cash + items was taken from my account this afternoon. 

I do not download [i]anything[/i] unless I know it is a 100% trusted source, and in fact I&#39;m usually too paranoid when it comes to what gets put on my machine. rsbots.net is really the only way my password could have been taken.

I take full responsibility for trusting them with my password, but honestly I have been using them for quite a long time and they are known for being trustworthy.

Anyways, just an FYI for any of you who use them, there is a chance your shit will get jacked.</description>

<p>Ummm I think that’s illegal because you must pay them for their bots(RSBuddy ftw). I think it was something else because if that website did that, they’d be forced to shut down their site. Also someone could take legal action against them. Run a scan on your computer for keyloggers.</p>

              <p>Ummm I think that’s illegal because you must pay them for their bots(RSBuddy ftw). I think it was something else because if that website did that, they’d be forced to shut down their site. Also someone could take legal action against them. Run a scan on your computer for keyloggers.</p>

Running a virus scan to try and detect a way they steal your details is a bit silly. Your virus scanner won’t be able to pick up on the bit of code used to pluck your password and send it off.<br>

I didn’t mean to detect anything within the bot, I ran the virus scan to see if I had a third party virus or something.[/quote]<br>
you can’t detect a keygen in java…</p>
