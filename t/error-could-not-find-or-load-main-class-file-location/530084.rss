    <title>&quot;Error: Could not find or load main class [File Location]&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-could-not-find-or-load-main-class-file-location/530084</link>
    <description>Alright, so, i&#39;ve been having problems opening .jars lately. So I went to change the default program for them through the control panel. But I think that might&#39;ve only made it worse. I changed it to javac, to javaw, to javaws, then to java, and now I get the error &quot;Error: Could not find or load main class [File location]&quot;. I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to fix this, and its starting to piss me off a little.
Any of you know how to fix this?</description>
