[center]Welcome to [b]Anarchy07[/b]. The old-school influenced private server that strives to give you the
best experience that we can possible deliver. Our goal is to create a strong-economy with a fun community. We want Skillers
and Slayers a like to stand an equal chance within the economy. We want to take all aspects that made RuneScape so great in
it&#39;s prime and recreate them in a modern-private server.

[b]Client: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6057978/Anarchy%20Client.rar
Forums: www.Anarchy07.com[/b]

The concept is simple, we&#39;ve taken some of the most extraordinary aspects of RuneScape &#39;07, whether it be the
minigames, the quests, the skilling, the clue scrolls, you name it, and make it our mission to bring them to life. We want players
to mantain that same feeling of progression, completion and pride when playing their accounts and so we have made it our
mission to the following things:

[b]Strengthen the Economy[/b] - To aid the new players, we&#39;ve
allowed shops to retain some of the fundamental items such as low level resources and armour. If you want the high level
food and armour you&#39;re going to have to fight your way for it, skill, or purchase it from skillers. This gives anyone who enjoys
skilling an equally good chance of making some nice profits as well as anyone who wishes to just kill to their hearts desire.


[b]Supply Quests[/b] - We&#39;ve added quests for a number of
reasons. The first thing to note is that quests are not full legnth but they do contain some witty, interesting dialogue for
anyone who&#39;s interested. We&#39;ve kept them short for those who find them tedious but one thing is for certain, they&#39;re always
rewarding and our quests will give you that satisfactory feeling - attaining some of the most powerful aspects you can get your
hands on
[u][b]
Features - TL;DR[/b][/u]
