    <description>Hey guys just thought i should let you know i have decided to spend money on getting a big RSPS up.
This might take a while so bare with me, at this time i am looking for web coders and server coders to help me along with this project. 

I have got a DEDI server situated in australia with 60 MB upload 160MB down Intel Core 2 Quad Q9650 3.0GHz 12MB L2 Cache  8 gig of ram 5000gig bandwidth so its pretty decent size. 

If you would like to help with this project PM me and we will go from their. ( i have a webhost unlimited everything just need a domain need to figure a name)

Web Developer:

Requirements

    * Strong graphic design skills, artistic sense, and fluency in Photoshop
    * Ability to work within and build upon the Runescape site style (easy to use for members)
    * Understanding of information flow, readability, and interface usability design principles
    * Passion for web design and games
    * Strong communication skills, ability to communicate with international team
    * Coding experience and basic understanding of XHTML and CSS
    * Knowledge about web localization
    * Extensive knowledge of PHP and MYSQL databases.
    * 1-2 years minimum work experience in related field

(other requirements) 
# Proficiency in creating interactive, animated web designs with Adobe Flash
# Familiarity with web scripting languages such as Java Script and Action Script
# Design related background and/or education
# Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field

Game Coder (taken)
# Familiar with common Java web programming.
# Experience with developing localized web sites/applications
# Familiar with payment processing and e-commerce systems
# 1-2 years experience in general Java coding

Note: these doing these two roles may also include some sort of customer support (forums live chat ect) so fluent english is a +. 

YOU WILL BE PAID FOR YOUR WORK WITH US AS LONG AS YOU FULFILL YOUR TASKS ON TIME. (may have to wait a month untill my business number becomes approved then you will be paid)

To even be considered you need to have a site coded by you uploaded somewhere for me too view. Please dont give me those rubbish ucoz sites that are pre-made. You will be declined immediately.

Same goes for server/client coder you need to submit some of your own work NOT OTHERS.

EDIT: not quite sure where this is to fit in (move if need be)</description>
