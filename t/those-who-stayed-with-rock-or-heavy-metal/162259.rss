              <p>Let’s just settle this little genre slap fight by acknowledging that music tastes vary from person to person. I agree, some lyrics suck and there isn’t any argument about that. I think we can all agree when this occurs most: when a band, rapper, whatever, sells out. All I can do is preach diversity. Bored of rock at the moment? Pick up some rap or trance. I won’t advocate modern country music; that’s just abuse of a guitar. Don’t agree? That’s totally cool. Stop being so damn intolerant of other genres. You’re hardly better than akisboy32 when you do this shit: he suicide-bombed people not in his religion, you flame people with musical tastes differing from your own.</p>

You should really listen to your own advice, because you heard a few songs in rock about their bad lives, you said all rock is like that. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>

<p>Man. This is such a bias argument. I’m not saying one is better than the other, I’m not saying every song in the rock genre is all about how bad their lives are(but it usually is…). Don’t freak out when I say something about your precious rock. Most metal bands I like, but some of them I can’t stand the lyrics. Not like I can’t understand them, but they throw their words around more than most of the new hip-hop shit that people call rap. ‘Death Metal’ is not touching, it’s usually vial and horrible, swearing to kill.</p>

<p>How can you say it’s bias when I’ve defended both rock and rap? Nor am I freaking out. I have a valid point.<br>
(Melodic) Death metal, and (symphonic) power metal are good examples of emotional lyrics. Nightwish, CoB and Kalmah are very good examples of that, which is why they are so famous. They’re instrumental parts are good, so are the lyrics.</p>

I like both, but I like from rock/metal genre:</p>
<p>Slipknot<br>
Black Sabbath<br>
Children of Bodom<br>
Cradle of Filth<br>
and Lamb of God I suppose</p>
<p>But those are more modern(as in, they’ve sung recently), I prefer older rock when it actually sounded good. Like Metallica and ACDC in their prime.</p>
<p>OP: Your a narrow minded son of a bitch that has no respect nor decency to accept more than one genre of music. Rap(the real rap, not this bullshit hip-hop you listen too) takes skill, it takes time. To rap you have to write a story with your words; <span class="bbcode-b">rock just screams and sings about how bad their lives are</span>. Rap takes a more positive turn, they sing of money and such(usually hip-hop does this). Listen to these songs and tell me rap sucks:</p>

<p>is not 100% true, They talk about money,right? But how did they get that money?.. Stealing cars, and killing people, or selling drugs, and talk about how they mis-treat girls, and sex, and the list continues, but, Not ALL songs are like that, maybe 99.1% of it is?</p>
