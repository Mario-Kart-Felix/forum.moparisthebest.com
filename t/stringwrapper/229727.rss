    <title>StringWrapper</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stringwrapper/229727</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve been experimenting lately and am having a few problems with StringWrapper fields.

Now, iirc, a StringWrapper (or RSString) type is, basically, a glorified byte[].  Yes, I know there is more to it.


My issue is trying to reflect one.  I&#39;m working on reflecting a [b]static[/b] StringWrapper and converting it to a byte[] so we can get the text.  I first tried the simple code I would use for any static field:

[code]String value = stringWrapperField.get(null).toString();[/code]

This however, throws an exception known as &quot;dj&quot;.  Now this, obviously, is a class in the client.  Upon investigation, I have come to the conclusion that the class &quot;dj&quot; handles exceptions specific to their StringWrapper class (and maybe other classes?).

Anywho, I was unable to ascertain why my error was occurring.

So, I tried some different code.

[code]Object value = ((Object) stringWrapperField.get(null)).toString();[/code]

Which, posed the exact same error.

In a mad fit, I tried the last thing I could think of.

[code]byte[] valuez = ((byte[]) stringWrapperField.get(null));
String value = new String(valuez);[/code]

Which posed an error that type &quot;dh&quot; (or whatever the StringWrapper class is...cant remember) can&#39;t be casted to B[ (which, as you know, is byte[]).


So, I have exhausted everything I can think of, so I figured my best bet was to post about it and hope someone else has had some experience with this.</description>

<p>also, dont cast</p>
<p>use: <code>
        Field stringField;

Yes, a static variable or method is a variable or method which is not attached to a single object, but rather the class as a whole.</p>
<p>So, via static variables, there is no need to create a new instance of the class to access them.</p>
<p>What I am saying is that if the argument is ignored, what is the point of putting one in?  And regardless, would it not still throw a ClassCast exception as df is still not castable to byte[]…<br>

If you get that cast exception, then you don’t get the byte array.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Field someStringField;

<p>It should work something like this.<br>
You have a string field. From that field you get the byteArray.</p>
<p>(Untested and just created by looking at the docs for a second…)[/quote]Yes, because although the StringWrapper is static, the bytes in the byte[] might not be.</p>
<p>Frank_ and speljohan helped me with this last night so I know the answer.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone.</p>

<p>Anyways, the documentation is actually a little vague on this subject.  Unless I’m just an idiot and don’t know how to read it.</p>
<blockquote>get
<p>public Object get(Object obj)<br>
throws IllegalArgumentException,<br>
IllegalAccessException</p>
<pre><code>Returns the value of the field represented by this Field, on the specified object. The value is automatically wrapped in an object if it has a primitive type.

The underlying field's value is obtained as follows:

If the underlying field is a static field, the obj argument is ignored; it may be null.

Otherwise, the underlying field is an instance field. If the specified obj argument is null, the method throws a NullPointerException. If the specified object is not an instance of the class or interface declaring the underlying field, the method throws an IllegalArgumentException.

If this Field object enforces Java language access control, and the underlying field is inaccessible, the method throws an IllegalAccessException. If the underlying field is static, the class that declared the field is initialized if it has not already been initialized.

Otherwise, the value is retrieved from the underlying instance or static field. If the field has a primitive type, the value is wrapped in an object before being returned, otherwise it is returned as is.

If the field is hidden in the type of obj, the field's value is obtained according to the preceding rules.

Parameters:
    obj - object from which the represented field's value is to be extracted 
Returns:
    the value of the represented field in object obj; primitive values are wrapped in an appropriate object before being returned&lt;/blockquote&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The interesting thing is, the field I am working with is a static field.  So the argument is ignored anyways.</p>

              <p>Dh seems to be the obfuscated name for the RSString class, correct? If so, you can’t call the toString() method in it. If you look at the code, that throws a new RuntimeException (or apparently the client’s class which extends RuntimeException).</p>

              <p>Well, I’ve been experimenting lately and am having a few problems with StringWrapper fields.</p>
<p>Now, iirc, a StringWrapper (or RSString) type is, basically, a glorified byte[].  Yes, I know there is more to it.</p>
<p>My issue is trying to reflect one.  I’m working on reflecting a <span class="bbcode-b">static</span> StringWrapper and converting it to a byte[] so we can get the text.  I first tried the simple code I would use for any static field:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">String value = stringWrapperField.get(null).toString();</code></pre>
<p>This however, throws an exception known as “dj”.  Now this, obviously, is a class in the client.  Upon investigation, I have come to the conclusion that the class “dj” handles exceptions specific to their StringWrapper class (and maybe other classes?).</p>
<p>Anywho, I was unable to ascertain why my error was occurring.</p>
<p>So, I tried some different code.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Object value = ((Object) stringWrapperField.get(null)).toString();</code></pre>
<p>Which, posed the exact same error.</p>
<p>In a mad fit, I tried the last thing I could think of.</p>
<p><code>byte[] valuez = ((byte[]) stringWrapperField.get(null));
String value = new String(valuez);</code></p>
<p>Which posed an error that type “dh” (or whatever the StringWrapper class is…cant remember) can’t be casted to B[ (which, as you know, is byte[]).</p>
<p>So, I have exhausted everything I can think of, so I figured my best bet was to post about it and hope someone else has had some experience with this.</p>
