    <title>&quot;you need to be in the wilderness to attack this player&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/you-need-to-be-in-the-wilderness-to-attack-this-player/182227</link>
    <description>I asked about this yesterday and didn&#39;t get any help. I am sure many of you are capable of doing this =).
Right now in my server you can attack someone thats in the wild even if you are not. How can i make it so that you also need to be in the wild to attack a player.


Another thing, do any of you know how to make the objects of a dead player appear right away after they die? 
I really need answers to these questions. Help is greatly appreciated
Thanks</description>
