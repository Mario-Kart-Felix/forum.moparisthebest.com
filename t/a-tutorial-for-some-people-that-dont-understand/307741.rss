    <description>Im going to give you some information on how to make a server.


This was made by me 100%!


Step 1. Find a source. You can use moparscape to find one like go to server downloads.
THATS EASY!


Step 2.Go to no-ip.com and register an email and password
Then, go to host and add an ip.   EXAMPLE:[Example].no-ip.biz
            only put this in the box                ^ ^ ^ ^

Now download it and you got no-ip

Now, i dont really know to portfoward so i just use...Utorrent.
Http://www.utorrent.com Download it.
Soon as its downloaded go to preferences- connection now before you start putting 43594 as the port in be sure ur source is running first. then you can put it in and press apply. then press ok and exit out now your server works for other people and yourself!
