    <title>Chinese hackers crack iTunes gift cards algorithm</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chinese-hackers-crack-itunes-gift-cards-algorithm/267035</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Apple may have a big problem on its hands with iTunes gift cards. According to Chinese record industry consultancy firm, Outdustry, the algorithm behind the cards has been cracked and as a result $200 voucher codes are being sold for as little as $2.60 online. These vouchers have apparently been available for six months on Chinese online store Taobao, a consumer-to-consumer website in which Yahoo holds a 40 percent stake, with prices dropping from around $47 at that time as more sellers came into the market. 


 

Apple has not officially commented on the matter yet but it seems likely that a change will have to be made to the current algorithm. That, however, could potentially invalidate all the legitimate gift cards around the world. With Apple looking to bring its iPhone to the Chinese market it should be interesting to see just how the company responds to this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>think about it, youve gotta have some database of valid keys somewhere (otherwise how do you know that key x has been used…). they arent valid until activated, so even if someone had cracked the algorithm, youve got to brute force it until you find one that has been bought, but not paid for. the chances of stumbling on one are MINISCULE, think this is basically the same method that online cdkeys for games use, and they dont have to wait until being bought for activation, and even THEN the chances are retardedly small that youll get a working key.</p>

they should be storing each gift card that they create in some sort of database, that links the card id to whether its been used and how much money is left on it</p>
<p>however, it could be that they instead use some algorithm to generate the id’s, and instead of storing all the cards they create, when the card is used its checked against their algorithm, and only then is it added to the db. then once it is used up it wont be possible to use again of course. that would be really silly though and im not sure why they would want to do that, but its the only way i can think of this working</p>

<p>That sounds quite obvious. The numbers have to be tracked, otherwise Apple won’t know the value belonging to that number. If there isn’t a database with these numbers and their corresponding values, the cards will have an unlimited value.</p>
