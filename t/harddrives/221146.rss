    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/harddrives/221146</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;m in the middle of making my old Dell Dimension into a webserver. Well, nothing has been going the way planned. I&#39;ve been trying to install UNIX OS and Windows OS on the hard drive.. but no partitions at all have been found. So I think the hard drive is shot (Dell support said). I was wondering if any hard drive can fit into any computer.</description>

              <p>Just going to shift this over to Questions, but more on topic, I wouldn’t advise using Norton Partition Magic, I’ve had trouble with that in the past.</p>
<p>Despite that, from the general things you’ve said, I’d recommend just buying a new drive since they are massively cheaper now.</p>

SATA data transfer is faster.<br>
IDE is slower.<br>
Personally I only use SATA drives.</p>

Well, I don’t know how to create a partition even though I do have Norton Partition Maker and when I went to install Windows it said there wasn’t any partitions on the hard drive. Well, I made one big one on my computer im on now as the slave drive then took it and put it in the other computer and it said the same thing.</p>
