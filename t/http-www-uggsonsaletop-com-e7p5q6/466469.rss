    <description>We shot some mussels http://www.uggsonsaletop.com/ for &lt;a href=http://www.uggsonsaletop.com/&gt; Cheap ugg boots &lt;/a&gt; the day. Good old mussels! Giannina styled them so well, they looked ready to eat! She &lt;a href=http://www.uggsonsaletop.com/&gt; Cheap ugg boots uk &lt;/a&gt; brought some extra antique kitchenware with her, since we both share the same love for rusty utensils. The highlights tend to look really harsh http://www.uggsonsaletop.com/ in food editorials today. The Hay grid is a form of &quot;Discipline and Punish/Reward, Weber&#39;s Iron Cage. Until we change the Hay-inspired systems, the &lt;a href=http://www.uggsonsaletop.com/&gt; Discount ugg outlet &lt;/a&gt; supervisory interview, &lt;a href=http://www.uggsonsaletop.com/&gt; uggs Outlet &lt;/a&gt; the annual compensation review, the files on each employee to be seen by the supervisor not the employee, the surveilled email, the policies against &quot;theft of company time&quot; etc we will not change our corporate world nor our corporatized selves. Yes, I have thought much about the &quot;microtexture&quot; of the systems in which we live and work, and I now have 7 years of blogging, social computing and knowledge management background</description>
