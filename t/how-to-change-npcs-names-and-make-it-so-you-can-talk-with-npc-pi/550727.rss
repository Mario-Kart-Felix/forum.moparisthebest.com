    <title>How to change NPC&#39;s Names and Make it so you can talk with npc (PI)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-change-npcs-names-and-make-it-so-you-can-talk-with-npc-pi/550727</link>
    <description>So this is my first tutorial and i decided to make this because i couldn&#39;t find it anywhere and also i was stuck myself until i worked it out.

today im going to show you how to change the combat level, name, description and also make non-talking npc talk-able
 ( this is so you can add a teleport option to npc what don&#39;t normally talk).

Let&#39;s start by changing an npc&#39;s info. 

First open up [b]EntityDef.java[/b] (client side)

you should see something like this...

&lt;blockquote&gt;public static EntityDef forID(int i) {
		for (int j = 0; j &lt; 20; j++)
            if(cache[j].interfaceType == (long)i)
                return cache[j];
		anInt56 = (anInt56 + 1) % 20;
		EntityDef entityDef = cache[anInt56] = new EntityDef();
		stream.currentOffset = streamIndices[i];
		entityDef.interfaceType = i;
		entityDef.readValues(stream);&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under that, put this.

&lt;blockquote&gt;   if(i == ****) {
		    entityDef.itemActions = new String[5];
			entityDef.standAnim = 0;//stand animation
			entityDef.name = &quot;NPC name&quot;;
			entityDef.description = &quot;Description.&quot;.getBytes();
		}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

**** - is the Npc ID.
NPc name - is the name of your npc
Description - is the Descripton of what your npc is or does
change the text you see in color to your own Npc your are wanting to change.

so if i wanted to change rock crabs this is what it would look like before i changed it

&lt;blockquote&gt;   if(i == 1265) {
		    entityDef.itemActions = new String[5];
			entityDef.standAnim = 0;//stand animation
			entityDef.name = &quot;rock crabs&quot;;
			entityDef.description = &quot;its a rock crab.&quot;.getBytes();
		}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and this is what it would look like when i have renamed it..

&lt;blockquote&gt;   if(i == 1265) {
		    entityDef.itemActions = new String[5];
			entityDef.standAnim = 0;//stand animation
			entityDef.name = &quot; sea crab&quot;;
			entityDef.description = &quot;its a crab from the sea.&quot;.getBytes();
		}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[b]as long as the npc ID is the same as the npc your wanting to edit it will change that npc[/b]

so now it you wanted to change its [b]combat level[/b] you would add &quot;entityDef.combatLevel = put npc level here;//Combat Level&quot;

so it would look like this now when i change its [b]combat-level[/b] to 783

&lt;blockquote&gt;   if(i == 1265) { //npcID
		    entityDef.itemActions = new String[5];
			entityDef.standAnim = 0;//stand animation
			entityDef.name = &quot;rock crabs&quot;;//name
			entityDef.combatLevel = 783;//Combat Level
			entityDef.description = &quot;its a rock crab.&quot;.getBytes();//description
		}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now if you want to make an [b]NPC have the option to talk to/with[/b] then add &quot;    entityDef.itemActions[0] = &quot;Talk To&quot;;    &quot;

so it would look like this 

&lt;blockquote&gt;   if(i == 1265) { //npcID
		    entityDef.itemActions = new String[5];
			entityDef.itemActions[0] = &quot;Talk To&quot;; //so you can speak with the npc
			entityDef.standAnim = 0;//stand animation
			entityDef.name = &quot;rock crabs&quot;; //name
			entityDef.combatLevel = 783; //Combat Level
			entityDef.description = &quot;its a rock crab.&quot;.getBytes(); //description
		}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&quot;please note delete what i have highlighted in green, they are just there to show you what its for&quot;
and always save before you compile 

right we are done, i hope this helps</description>
