    <title>Laced weed I think, what the fuck did I smoke?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/laced-weed-i-think-what-the-fuck-did-i-smoke/211444</link>
    <description>I bought a stick last Friday, and smoked 2 bowls this afternoon at around 4 in celebration that my maths exam is over. I used a gravity bong. For some reason weed usually takes me an hour to hit me (yes I&#39;m doing it properly, and it&#39;s been real weed) but this time it only took 10 minutes or so. I had a much different high this time, it lasted over 3 hours, only affected me from the shoulders down, and it sucked.

It&#39;s impossible to explain what it was like, but I&#39;ll give it a shot:

It was much much more intense than weed, and I kept having different feelings. At first there were spikes of numbness shooting very quick through my body, and my mind was buzzing. After about 25 minutes I had a panic attack that lasted over an hour. I kept freaking out, thinking that it wouldn&#39;t go away. I read some shit about laced drugs, including a guy ending up in a mental hospital after 1 trip and got really paranoid - thinking something got fucked in my brain and that It was permanent, I kept thinking about hanging myself, and it was all I could think about other than longing for it to go away. Rubbing my face made that area feel less intense.

After the numbness shooting through me really intensely it switched to other things every 10 minutes or so. They were all unpleasant. 
After the panic attack finished, I could still feel it but less intensely. It slowly started going away, then it just felt like weed at around 6:30, now It&#39;s almost gone at 10pm.

Does anybody know what the hell I smoked?</description>

<p>Yeah I can think of some smokable drugs, but really they are smoked much differently and I don’t think you can apply a flame to them.[quote=“SonGoku, post:11, topic:211444”]Alot do. They want  you to get hooked. They pinch off  your weed to save money.It does happen.[/quote]</p>

Actually it doesn’t sound like e at all. Especially seeing as you can’t smoke e.</p>
<p>You know a 3 hour high, cotton mouth, and getting tired afterwards sound exactly like weed to me. There’s been a lot of times in the past when I was still somewhat new to weed that I was positive I smoked laced shit. The truth is, laced shit doesn’t even exist unless you are aware of it and paying extra. It just doesn’t make sense for someone to put free drugs into it, despite what the media says.</p>
<p>I gotta be honest, I think you just had some good weed and your panic attack is what made things go bad. Sounds like some indicia stuff because of the physical effects you described.</p>
<p>Also I don’t understand how you normally get high an hour later. You should feel it almost right away. Get some more [different] shit and smoke it and see if it still takes an hour.</p>
<p>[/quote]Yeah the tripping, etc… seemed like just weed to me, but then the more touching type shit sounds like it was laced with e, how can’t you smoke e? Can’t you break it up in a spliff?[/quote]</p>
<p>The heat will only destroy the MDMA. Assuming we are discussing clean “e” pills anyways. Not all drugs can be smoked.</p>

              <p>I bought a stick last Friday, and smoked 2 bowls this afternoon at around 4 in celebration that my maths exam is over. I used a gravity bong. For some reason weed usually takes me an hour to hit me (yes I’m doing it properly, and it’s been real weed) but this time it only took 10 minutes or so. I had a much different high this time, it lasted over 3 hours, only affected me from the shoulders down, and it sucked.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to explain what it was like, but I’ll give it a shot:</p>
<p>It was much much more intense than weed, and I kept having different feelings. At first there were spikes of numbness shooting very quick through my body, and my mind was buzzing. After about 25 minutes I had a panic attack that lasted over an hour. I kept freaking out, thinking that it wouldn’t go away. I read some shit about laced drugs, including a guy ending up in a mental hospital after 1 trip and got really paranoid - thinking something got fucked in my brain and that It was permanent, I kept thinking about hanging myself, and it was all I could think about other than longing for it to go away. Rubbing my face made that area feel less intense.</p>
<p>After the numbness shooting through me really intensely it switched to other things every 10 minutes or so. They were all unpleasant.<br>
After the panic attack finished, I could still feel it but less intensely. It slowly started going away, then it just felt like weed at around 6:30, now It’s almost gone at 10pm.</p>
<p>Does anybody know what the hell I smoked?</p>
