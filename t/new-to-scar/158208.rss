              <p>SCAR is a macro program that can do many undetectable/dectable functions (depending on what function your using).</p>
<p>It requires the functions connected together repeated <em>OPTIONAL</em> until whenever you say so (depending on the function again).</p>
<p>SRL is an include made by a couple people to help out <span class="bbcode-b">a lot</span>.</p>
<p>It makes life feel pacified.</p>
<p>So SRL contains a variety of <span class="bbcode-b">other</span> functions but does include <span class="bbcode-b">all</span> of SCAR functions, because it’s based on that.</p>
<p>An example is that SRL is the engine, and SCAR is the car, with all the other functions with it.</p>
<p>SCAR without SRL is <span class="bbcode-b">much</span> harder to script without it.</p>
<p>Well that’s all I have to say.</p>

<p>Scar is a programmable macro. It uses a language comparable to Pascal or Delphi. Here is an example of a basic woodcutter, wich probably won’t work but you get the point:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">program woodcutter;

const treecolor = '3124324' //a color syntax

procedure findtree; //tells Scar that a new procedure starts here
begin //begin the commands after this
if findcolor(x, y, treecolor) then //if the treecolor is found then...
movemouse(x,y); //move the mouse to those coordinates
end; //end the procedure

end. //end of the program</code></pre>
<p>Also waht version do i need to use scar scripts?</p>
<p>Check <a href="http://www.freddy1990.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.freddy1990.com</a> for the latest version, it’s 3.12c iirc.</p>
<p>SRL What is “SRL”?? — Could someone tell me waht it is?</p>
<p>SRL means Scar Resource Library. It contains a huge amount of functions to help you make your own scripts. For example, it contains Anti Random procedures, so you wont be killed by a tree spirit. Go to <a href="http://www.srl-forums.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.srl-forums.com</a> to find out more about it.</p>

              <p>Well scar can be taken very far so we can explain what you can do with it and tell you how but we cant really tell you exactly how to use it. Look in the scar facts and tutoriuls section, srl is and include that you put into scar to make it<br>
a).Less detectable(for rs2 mainly)<br>
b).do other things for you like randoms(^^) etc<br>
there is a forums, its <a href="http://www.srl-forums.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.srl-forums.com</a> i hope that explained it, if you have any more questions pm me</p>
