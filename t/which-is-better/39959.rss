    <title>Which Is Better?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-is-better/39959</link>
    <description>Hey Guys  :cool:

I just registered because I was thinking of buying a pay script guild miner.

Problem is, I don&#39;t know which is better... Is Sumillions Or Mad Cows Better??

Could someone help me out and compare them side by side and tell me all those details?? I would really appreciate it.

Anyway, Thanks Guys</description>

              <p>Well if you read Sumillions it sounds better<br>
Sumillions</p>
<blockquote>- Flawless walking.
- Multiple users can be used !
- Smooth mining, if someone else mined it away, it will move on.
- Mines Mith as well, once it sees it, it wont stop mining it until its gone Big Grin
- AntiBan (at choice)
- AntiRandoms from SRL, guaranteed to be good.
- Nice progress reporter
- AutoColored!! For all you lazy peeps out there, no need to fill it in !
- Easy to use forms, if you still don't understand them ill be more than happy to explain.
- Very own openbank procedures, never failed me and i've tried to make it fail Wink
- Improved Anti-gas!! (had complaints about it :S)
- Attaches Paxe-head when it flies off ! (not 100%)
- In the slight chance that the paxe will be lost, it will get the best paxe there is from the bank</blockquote>
Mad cow's
<blockquote>-PERFECT auto-colour
-New walking procedure that is more efficient and faster
-Use with unlimited accounts
-Superior mining procedure
-Forms to make it simple
-News system
-And it's currently OPEN SOURCE</blockquote> 
Also Mad Cow's is 250k more.
