    <description>[b]Hi guys I was just on RuneScape and then Right clicked and Clicked Viewed Source and caught at sight at a Link so I clicked it and it took me to a Website with some random Tutorials/Helpers. It doesnt really teach much about coding but some about Fourms and stuff Lists, Texts, Links and Tables and such.[/b]

But when you get to the Site scroll Down until you see Quick Table Contents or even use CTRL F to search it.

Heres the Site:
