I’d go with the advice of pk6uhave2. It would be more handy to have something for you to check its bank for something suspicious when necessary. If that didn’t find anything you can always just manually log in without needing to have his password or write a code to have it. Copy paste your own password in his character file (assuming your source is using character files in raw txt form) log in with the password and after checking its bank put his password back into its place.</p>
<p>Going manually over accounts just sounds like too much work for me anyway <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Besides what about a bank command that shows his bank while you’re still logged in on your own account? (::otherbank PLAYERNAME) Just a suggestion.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Dude wtf I said that in my first post, there are already commands such as ::checkbank (player name) and ::chackinv (player name) it’s in many servers such as the hybridpvps…[/quote]</p>
