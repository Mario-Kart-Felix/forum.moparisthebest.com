So to the left of the image is the spawned npc and to the right is the player using pnpc command to look like npc (or ship..).

So below is the Client Sided code and within it is &quot;aByte68&quot; which signifies how many tiles the npc will cover. now it works fine for the npc and if we spawn an npc but if the player does ::pnpc 2501 then he will become the npc but the tiles will overlap him. So what would I have to do Client Side or Server Side to make the tiles not overlap? I&#39;ve been trying to find something but Im not getting anywhere with it, would appreciate the help! Thankyou

[code]	if(i == 2501) { // NPC ID 
    entityDef.actions = new String[5];
    entityDef.actions[1] = &quot;Attack&quot;;
    entityDef.models = new int[1]; // Number of models the NPC us
    entityDef.models[0] = 25001; 
    entityDef.name = &quot;Sail Boat&quot;;
    entityDef.combatLevel = 10; //combat level
    entityDef.aByte68 = 5;*** CHANGES HOW MANY TILES THE SHIP WILL SHOW OVER I THINK IT GOES 5X5 UNLESS CHANGED. ***
    entityDef.description = &quot;Sail Boat used in new sail boat minigame.&quot;.getBytes();

<p>Thanks so much for responding!! And yea i was looking through the client a little more yesterday and notice that int and stuff im gunna download a refractored client maybe and see if that can help me by comparing them. If you could continue to help me find this out id really appreciate it it would help me soooooo much with my project ill probably look at it somemore tmorrow and see what happens</p>
