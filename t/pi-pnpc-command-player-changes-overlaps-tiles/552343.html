        <p>What you have to do (Which has been said before) is you have to find where the client changes your player to an NPC, and apply the same code that is being applied to the NPC to keep their size properly.</p>
<p>I have no idea why you placed this in Server Help, as everything will be client sided. The server has no control over this feature (Except which npc you change to)</p>
<p>Look in Player.java in the client,<br>
your updatePlayer method will contain the code that makes the player an npc.</p>
<p>Edit: Further looking into the code, you don’t want aByte68… It looks like there’s an int “anInt1540” that actually controls it. However, this int is set to the value of aByte68 in a couple of places.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for responding!! And yea i was looking through the client a little more yesterday and notice that int and stuff im gunna download a refractored client maybe and see if that can help me by comparing them. If you could continue to help me find this out id really appreciate it it would help me soooooo much with my project ill probably look at it somemore tmorrow and see what happens</p>
