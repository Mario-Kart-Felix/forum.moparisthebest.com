    <title>Does there exist anything like a program that recognizes models?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-there-exist-anything-like-a-program-that-recognizes-models/339322</link>
    <description>So basicly I&#39;m trying to dump a city model from a game called Yerevan Drive (old skool) but it&#39;s in atx, ref and tex, I think atx is the model, tex is the texture and ref is something idk. However I can&#39;t view the models in anything else but the game itself, I have done MANY research but no results, the best thing I found is 3D Ripper, it basicly ripps and converts any model that loaded up in your computer, the problem is the city is to big for it to rip it in one peace, it rips it in many small peaces and it takes forever to fit them together, so if I could get a model viewer for those files and inject it with 3D Ripper for ripping the full track, would be awesome. So basicly I either need a program that recognizes decrpted models or one that let&#39;s me view those models, or like one that let&#39;s you view ALL model types of this planet. If in someway I could view the full track, would be enough.</description>

              <p>After some exploring the games files I found out that the ATX is the thing where the models of the game are in, in other words it’s an zip archieve, I researched and found out that this was indeed true, however now the big problem is how to extract the ATX archieve, please help. I tried winrar, 7zip and winrar.</p>
