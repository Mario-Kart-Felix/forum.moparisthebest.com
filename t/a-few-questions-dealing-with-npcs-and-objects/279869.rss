    <title>A few questions dealing with npc&#39;s and objects</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions-dealing-with-npcs-and-objects/279869</link>
    <description>I have a few questions about autospawn, npc&#39;s, and world objects.  Please answer them if you can  :)

Ok first, I wanted to know how you spawn an npc, so he is stationary.  I know that you go into autospawnand then add him to the list, with his id and stuff, but when I compile, and then turn my server on, the server messes up, and it won&#39;t log in.  So could you tell me how to correctly autospawn an npc.

Ok, the other question:  I was wondering how you make, say like, a bank appear.  When I go into global objects, and insert the numbers and compile, then turn my server on, the bank is not there, as if i never typed it into the global objects thing.

Ok that&#39;s about it. Thx for your time.  \</description>

<p>0 0 0 0 0 means that he doesnt walk and stand only.</p>
