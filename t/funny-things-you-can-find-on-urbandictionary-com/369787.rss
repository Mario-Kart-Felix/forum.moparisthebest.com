    <description>Discuss funny definitions of words on urbandictionary.com


Rules:
No flaming each others find.
No saying I found it first.
No trolling.
No being a fag.

I&#39;ll start....

Urban: RVG:

Rancid Vagina Gangsters: A gang in New Hampshire who as a whole think they&#39;re hard. They go by &quot;Red Villain Gang&quot;, but are pussies who wont show up for a fight... and if they do, they run away.

A bunch of them go to my school, their fucking fags...</description>

              <blockquote>[u]James[/u]
In early European lore the demigod James was said to possess unrivaled charm and seductive prowess in addition to having genitalia of supernatural size. Throughout medieval times and up until the late Renaissance, Pagan and Christian farmers routinely prayed to James as a god of fertility, believing that his massive penis would inspire them to spectacular heights of fertility. Today, the term James still carries with it subtexts of truly gigantic genitals which is perhaps why James is the name most frequently given to male newborns in the United States.
Currently the word James can be used to mean an enormous penis and anyone with that name can be assumed to possess a heavy and girthy penis.
"Man, check out that James!"
<p>“Look at the buldge in his trousers, he MUST have a James in there girlfriend!”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I could ever fit a James in my mouth.”</p>

MoparScape is a client that connects to RuneScape private servers. RuneScape private servers and everything to do with them is usually called “Mopar server”. The MoparScape community is filled with 9-13 idiots with no knowledge of Java the whole community of private servers is a great lulz. Private Servers usually have retarted names created by people with no imagination heres some of the names “BloodScape” “OwnageScape” “PK Isle X” “Ownage Isle” limitless basically choosing a random word and adding “Scape” to it. Netfucks such as people who fear the Mopar because of the brainwash RuneScape communitys and Jagex put on them think that the mopar contains spyware keyloggers and other shit porn websites give to you. People sometimes release their servers for others to work on however these servers are usually crap meaning shit that anyone can do. The private server community is very protective of their crappy work they will call anyone who has replicated their work “leechers” a word every moparscapian fears to be called . Sometimes these moparscapians form development but do not know that everyone they recruit are useless shit. There is one protective bigshot who won’t release it’s client cause it fears TEH LEECHAZ. Sometimes servers create online forums usually free and always SMFFORFREE for their only-to-be-online-for-3-days server. Every server has an admin to watch the players. These admins will ban you on the spot and will ruin your gameplay. This is only a brief introduction into the horrors of runescape private servers.</p>
