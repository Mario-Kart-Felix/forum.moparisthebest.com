    <title>317 delta gold coin bug</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-gold-coin-bug/551945</link>
    <description>Hey everyone. I&#39;m new to coding so I figured I should start off with a stable base like Delta.

The source is good and everything but when I buy something from the store, it doesn&#39;t take my gold.

For example. If I had 100k and dragon scim is 80k. I will buy it, but it doesn&#39;t delete the gold from my inventory. I do not know where to start! Please Help!</description>

<p>Can you buy 2 of them with 100k? If yes, it does not delete the coins. If no, it just is not updating your client.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Where was the logic in that?<br>
Just because he can’t buy two doesn’t mean the client is not updating…<br>
It really depends on how his code is setup.<br>
Lets say the owner before him just commented out the delete code for coins. That would mean I could buy a full inventory of dragon scimitars with only having 80k, as it never deletes.<br>
And, if the code was anything like what PI had in the shop system (They used a for loop to add each individual item you bought), you could buy an inventory with one click because each time it looped it’d still see you had 80k.</p>
<p>Also, if the scimitar shows up in inventory and the coins don’t delete, the client is clearly updating.</p>
<p>So, yes OP, as Zymus said… You need to start with your shop code. Take a look at the buying method.[/quote]<br>
I said buy “2” and there is no button for that. My logic was buy 1, twice.</p>
<p><code>
if (BALANCE &gt; COUNT) {
//delete coins
//tell client the new count
}</code><br>
if delete coins does not exist, the BALANCE will still have enough to buy a second one.<br>
if the client update does not exist, the BALANCE will have been modified, but your actual BALANCE was decreased correctly.</p>
<p>It most likely is the case that the code was commented out for delete coins. That being because there are so many PVP servers. delta has a decent combat base(not perfect, but a type of base people play) so they may have used it for that. I cannot see a reason that someone would comment out the update code, unless they did both.</p>
