    <title>Have anyone ever thought about</title>

    <description>Actually updating the game, instead of just throwing in few &quot;custom&quot; features.

Like most of rsc spells are exactly the same, only difference being the power of missiles; whats the point of using earth strike if you are capable to cast fire? For example you could add ice type spells to freeze player or &quot;area of effect&quot; spells to cause damage to all players/monsters in certain area or make monsters weak for certain element (fire giants/demons/dragons could be weak against water spells, bears/wolfs and farm animals weak against fire etc etc etc...

Monsters are probably worst thing in rsc. There is no challenge at all. They can&#39;t cast spells, they can&#39;t heal, they don&#39;t flee (walking few tiles away is not fleeing).
They can&#39;t even catch you from running away. What&#39;s the point?

I think Andrew and his team were rushing too much by adding new &quot;content&quot;, so they forgot about actual gameplay features. Just think about it for a moment, would any of you play this game if it wasn&#39;t multiplayer? I know i wouldn&#39;t.

Player killing is the only thing that has kept this scene alive, of course its good thing, everyone loves it, but besides that there is nothing. Who is the best player of the game? who is the winner? the one who keeps his character logged in on afking spot and the one who clicks mining rock all day long. RSC doesn&#39;t even have actual story, quests are pretty much just random tasks. There is no deepness at all and there is no balance.

And before you say &quot;Do it yourself&quot; I&#39;d like to know what you think about all this. Do you enjoy the game as it is, or would you like to move on?</description>

<p>To stay on topic: I like how agility is replaced with rune crafting on some servers. I always wonder what other skill could be added to RSC. Would implementing farming into RSC be worth it?</p>

Forgive my lack of imagination<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Fine. here is few examples.</p>
<p>Frost bolt - Freezes target for few seconds (in case you fail to catch him from running away)<br>
Confuse - Makes target run opposite direction that he is attempting to<br>
Invisibility - Makes you invisible for certain time or until you attack someone.<br>
Phase - Teleports you to random location in 5x5 tile range.<br>
Necromancy - Drains health/prayer from target to you</p>
<p>Each of these spells would have cooldown based on the effect. Note that these are examples that just came to my mind after thinking a minute.[/quote]</p>
<p>I think those are some cool ideas. All those spell imo should be implemented but only for pve not for pvp. Then balancing<br>
shouldn’t be that big of a problem. Also paralyze monster should be removed from the prayer list. KBD and the like should<br>
have to be taken down by a group of players not just one guy with prayer robes and prayer pots.</p>
<p>Also the sig is stupid from any point of view but if you guys want to talk about it find another section.</p>

To counter that, it should be a high level spell able to inhibit the victim’s spell casting for 30 seconds. Built it before and had fun playing with it but i’m not sure if I’ll be using any magic in Wolf Kingdom or if it will be a more realistic medieval zombie survival game instead.</p>

              <p>Well if you cast confuse or freeze while engaged it could just take effect after combat.<br>
Invisibility would work only before you attack or cast on another player, but it couldn’t be used after combat, when opponent has seen you.<br>
And i dont see sleep that overpowered, it could be potential when you attempt to escape, unless your opponent can type fast. I don’t know about others, but i can solve captcha in seconds.</p>
<p>Of course everything needs to be tested in practice, but imo RSC combat needs some twist.</p>

Invisibility - Makes you invisible for certain time or until you attack someone.<br>

Necromancy - Drains health/prayer from target to you<br>
Sleep - Target falls asleep, until he solves captcha or is damaged</p>
<p>Each of these spells would have cooldown based on the effect. Note that these are examples that just came to my mind after thinking a minute.</p>

<p>No, im not comparing it to newer more advanced games. I complain about the lack of simple features which could be easily developed. Take a look at old 90’s rpgs, pretty much all of them are more advanced than RSC OR RS2.</p>

<p>May I direct you guys to the other far larger part of this forum that is RS2 development? They have AOE spells, NPCs with complex behaviour, and so on. And the combat system in RS2 makes that all possibly by not being turn based.</p>
<p>Also, regarding being impressed: You’re not impressed now because a) the game if 14 years old, b) you’re not 14 years younger, c) you’ve now been subjected to far more advanced and modern games and gaming systems. Of course you aren’t impressed. How stupid do you have to be to not see the real reason for that though? You’re trying to compare a relic to newer games.[/quote]</p>
<p>So what you’re trying to say is we should take a classic like pokemon and make it not turn based? You can have custom spells, npc ai and so on without the need to abandon the turn based system. We love the camera, sprites and general game play which is why we are here. If you took rsc and from 2003 and continued to develop it without the graphics overhaul, where would it be? Would they of added runecrafting? New Spells? Notes?</p>

              <p>Yeah, from what i remember, most adaptions I’ve seen in this game usually make, or break the game (and they’re not even completed additions to the game). If you’re going to add new features like this, it MUST be balanced out… Subtle, nice additions that compliment the game. This could work, but I think you’d need a logical, open, professional coder willing to adjust and re-adjust these freatures to make it fit right in. I don’t know anyone in this scene with the requirements to go through that kind of hell, to benefit this horrible community, for free. The coder would basically be a game Developer.</p>
<p>To the guy above me… good one. Lol.</p>
