    <title>Giving Darts Projectiles? &amp; Running to Range if to far away?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/giving-darts-projectiles-running-to-range-if-to-far-away/246948</link>
    <description>Hi,

Once again another help thread by me :)

Here the thing, Knifes in delta are disabled... what ever i try i cant enable them. 

So im going with darts. When you wield them theres the normal options of rapid etc. So the wielding is right. 

Just wondering how i can make them so that they are a projectile and make them so you can range from same distance as range?

-------------------------------

Thanks, now question 2.


On delta you get the stupid message of &quot; You are too far away to range this person &quot;

Heres the code that make its say that:

[code]
if(UseBow || UseCrossBow || UseRing){
if(GoodDistance(EnemyX, EnemyY, absX, absY, 8) == false){
sM(&quot;You are too far to range your enemy!&quot;);
ResetAttack();
return false;
}
}
[/code]

Now heres what i was thinking:

[code]
if(UseBow || UseCrossBow || UseRing){
if(GoodDistance(EnemyX, EnemyY, absX, absY, 8) == false) 
If(BadDistance(EnemyX, EnemyY, absX, absY, &gt;8) == ############ 
[/code]

Okai. You can laugh at my guess how to fix. The #### would be telling it to walk / run to 8 squares away.

This is completely wrong i know. It was just to explain what im asking. Basicly... how do i make the player run to 8 squares away if they are over the 8 sqaures.

Thanks :)</description>
