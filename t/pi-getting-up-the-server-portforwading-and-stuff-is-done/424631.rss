    <title>[PI] Getting up the server. (portforwading and stuff is done)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-getting-up-the-server-portforwading-and-stuff-is-done/424631</link>
    <description>So, my friend and I just portforwarded port 5555 and changed all the ports in our source and stuff to 5555. We have the no-ip up and in the server.java and client.java. He started up the server and we both went on client but neither of us could log in, if anyone could help us, reply, pm me, or add me on skype and join our call. Thank you</description>
