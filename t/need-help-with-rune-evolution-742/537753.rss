    <title>Need Help with Rune - Evolution 742</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-rune-evolution-742/537753</link>
    <description>Hey I&#39;ve been messing around with Rune evolution 742 for a bit now and am having trouble with making myself owner. I noticed the Player files are a .p format and uneditable. Is there a command i have to add to Regularplayer.java? Any help would be great! Thanks!


EDIT: Figured it out, thanks anyway :p</description>
