<p>May I please recommend for your next development, you keep track of your updates and progress via Developmental Log:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">IMPORTANT NOTES: 

- There have been MANY updates which are not listed in this Developmental Document. This 
  includes a complete re-structure of the entire base, complete simple and effective packaging,
  the implementation of an Event Manager which includes a disperser; tracking; logic; and
  is very efficient as a form of G.C. as well. The entire base has been altered in some fashion
  for the better. Many of the classes are very well organized, designed and documented.
  Modern Java conventions are strongly enforced and practiced - especially in original code.
  This project is being strictly created and exists for an educational experience which will  
  eventually be used to teach others. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a  
  transformation through programming and development of a modified framework with revised and 
  personalized objective code. Through hands-on experience and the thrist of knowledge with 
  interest andmotivation, one or more person(s) can use this basic engine to develop and design 
  their own independent video game.

- The Game is named Arcanum: Mysteria.

- For the duration of the ALPHA testing phases, Players have Administrative Rights and full  
  access to all Commands by default. In the Live game, Players will have access to 0 Commands.
  The Patch system will remain dormant until the Closed BETA Phase of testing.



Monday, August 4th, 2013:

- Compression Class cleaned, organized and noted. (CS)

- Entites Class organized and documented. (CS)


_______________________________________________________
Sunday, August 4th, 2013:

- We've noticed a shortage of Client-Sided updates. Entity Definitions Class has been
  cleaned, organized and documented. (CS)

- The Game-Master Client has been modified towards It's eventual closure and 
  full functionality. You will also be prompted once running the Game-Master Client.
  The security features of the Client require that the program have elevated permissions. (CS)

- The Official _PUBLIC_ Client has undergone more change as well, but in a smaller and more
  insignificant way. The Client lists the current Patch I.D. This is displayed in two strings. One is 
  shown in the prompt, the other in the Title. All messages displayed in the prompt can simply be 
  updated at anytime to share updates, events, plans, and more with the Players. (CS)

- Official _PUBLIC_ Client still has It's prompt for several reasons, but it is now closed once the
  Client has launched and finished unpacking/loading. A system is in the works that will enable
  us to make use of simple unaggressive pop-ups to alert Players of the aforementioned 
  updates, events, plans, etcetera. (CS)

_________________________________________________________
Saturday, August 3rd, 2013:

- The Logging system has been removed. It will be written in a practical manner that makes sense 
  this time. The removal of this also uncovered a possible conflict involving the initialization  
  process, which has been resolved. The Logging system was removed due to it being outdated 
  and inefficient. It was also scrapped because of new pack structure. (SS)

- A new update by DaeDalus allows us to customize any N.P.C. using the same Combat Style.
  For example, when attacking a Man, they will usually use punches, however if you try to
  run away, they will resort to kicking, as it is faster. Another example with a tweak would be
  Karil the Tainted. Karil uses a quick and rapid magic attack fired from his x-bow, but if you   
  attempt to flee - he will fire long-range powerful magic arrows which can have a devastating   
  effect. (SS)

________________________________________________________
Tuesday, July 30th, 2013:

- The entire N.P.C. Combat System has been vastly improved. All N.P.C. now also have 
  values for Magic and Range along with the default Melee. (SS)

- Hybrid N.P.C. Combat is now more reliable. For example, a Mage will cast spells at the 
  correct distance with flawless execution and timing every time. The Melee distance-check
  also has been streamlined to function more correctly. (SS)

_________________________________________________________
Friday, July 26th, 2013:

- A new alpha variation of the N.P.C. Hybrid Combat System is now in place. This variation focuses on using Range until the N.P.C. is close enough to melee the Player. (SS)

_________________________________________________________________________
Thursday, July 25th, 2013:

- The first alpha build of the N.P.C. Hybrid Combat System has been written. The system is functional, but is nowhere near complete. This is the first N.P.C. we've made so far that is capable of using both Magic and Melee attacks. As of the moment, the N.P.C. chases down the player in attempts to use Melee, and casts a spell if the player starts to get away. The timers are off, but a video has been created to satisfy the masses since so many people wanted to see. Please keep in mind, the system is NOT EVEN CLOSE to being halfway complete. (SS)

_________________________________________________________
Wednesday, July 24th, 2013:

- All paths for configurations and the few log files have been corrected. (SS)

_________________________________________________________
Monday, July 22nd, 2013:

- The basic and ALPHA version of Magic N.P.C. V.S. P.C. has been written. (SS)

__________________________________________________________
Sunday, July 21st, 2013:

- Corrected an issue with Melee V.S. P.C. Combat. If the Player attempted to attack the N.P.C. whilst the npc pathfinding reached a certain stage, it would flag the Player as in combat until
the update. (SS)

- If a N.P.C. is attacking a Player, once they go out of range and the N.P.C. retreats, the N.P.C. gains back all of their Hitpoints. (SS)

- All N.P.C. now have default animations for Walking, Attacking, and Death. Before this, all of the factors had to be set for each one. (SS)

- The following directories are now stored in the Trunk: cfg; log. The "cfg" directory is a container for configuration file, and is referenced externally. The "log" directory will contain all logged information, such as Chat logs, Trade logs, Duel logs, Combat logs, etc. (SS)

_____________________________________________________________
Friday, July 19th, 2013:

- Due to the new Command System, ALL Commands have been re-written. (SS)

- The Game-Master Command System has been re-worked. The new command input strings are envoked as: "cdp COMMAND". There are no symbols involved. When Players type this in-game -
their client elevations are checked (Official _Public_ Client has none), server-sided status is referenced, and absolutely nothing happens for the Player. NOTE: Later a pass phrase should be
implemented for all Game-Masters to be able to access Commands. (SS/CS)

- A few tweaks to select Commands: "cdp dd" now disables Dueling by removing the right-click
context menu option. When Dueling has been created, many more preventions will be put in place. "cdp dt" now disables Trading in the same fashion as the "dd" Command - with the same footnote. NOTE: Same needs to be done for the following: Disable Player Attacking; Disable Attacking; Disable Shops; Disable Following. (CS/SS)

- The Phase of the project is now stored in the .ini and referenced for a string of text upon login. Current Phase: Closed ALPHA. (SS)

- The Server now recognizes different Clients. There are only two Client versions at the moment: Official Public Client; Game-Master Client. (SS/CS)

- A Patch version tracker has been implemented. NOTE: This will only become active at the start of the Open BETA phase. The Patch version is fetched from an .ini file. The Patch version is adjusted as written below: (SS/CS)
	
	Starting Patch = 1.0.00

	Total Patch # = (1).0.00

	Server Adjustments in current Patch = 1.(0).00

	Client Adjustments in current Patch = 1.0.(00)

________________________________________________________________________
Monday, July 15th, 2013:

- The basic system of N.P.C. V.S. P.C. Range combat has been completed. (SS)

- Range-based N.P.C. now use a variation of Melee-based pathfinding logic. (SS)

- A _Public_ version of the Official Client has been established. This version of the Official Client has client-sided commands completely removed, debugging information deleted, but has not yet been closed. Once an updater has been implemented, the _Public_ Official Client will be unable to be crowbar'd. (CS)

__________________________________________________________________________
Wednesday, July 10th, 2013:

- Basic N.P.C. V.S. P.C. Melee combat implemented. (SS)

- Origin pathfinding logic has been added for Melee-based N.P.C. (SS)</code></pre>

        <p>Ok i’m going to actually break down the credits for the content in your server, not just whats visible by playing. Most serves (PI included) are based off WinterLove which was created by winterlove, this was the original private server and most hosted servers are based off of it today.</p>
<p>WinterLove’s Credits: 20%</p>
<p>Daiki then took the server through extreme conditioning and created a multiple-player server called BlakeScape.</p>
<p>Daiki’s Credits: 20%</p>
<p>This then turned into Emulous after a series of programmers got their hands on it. There is no serious documentation of those who contributed to it, but its fair to say it went through 2 - 3 more heavy revisions.</p>
<p>Emulous’s Credits: 20%</p>
<p>Emulous was then turned into RiotScape developed by LmcTruck who implemented many messy design patterns, not to say he didn’t implement some good content too.</p>
<p>LmcTruck 10%</p>
<p>Finally Sanity got his hands on the server and re-vamped the combat system and wrote the skills present in the original release, as well as ClanChat and other systems.</p>
<p>Sanity’s credits: 20%</p>
<p>Now we get to you my friend, even though you went through and modified the code you interact with in the game, all these people before you deserve credits as well.</p>
<p>Also i’m guessing a lot of your content came from tutorials or previous developers so i’m deducting another 9%. This includes event or task systems and skills you copied and pasted out of the tutorial section.</p>
<p>You now: 1%</p>
<p>I know when you see this you will argue that you moved entities around and added some ‘if’ ‘else’ statements. This is not programming, this is lightly modifying somebody else’s work and systems and taking an outrageous amount of credit for it.</p>
