    <description>ok well on my server (as well as any) you make  a monster, add HP to it but then it will hit higher with greater HP....well i KNOW that you can make it weaker, as my old friend had made monsters like that, but he hasnt been around in a long time, so i was wondering if anyone knew how? i will give a very nice reward</description>
