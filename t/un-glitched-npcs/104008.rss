    <title>Un-Glitched NPCS?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/un-glitched-npcs/104008</link>
    <description>Well, I was on a server and Jad wasn&#39;t glitched he even done his magic and range attack, and all other NPC&#39;s. Is there a tutorial here or something that fixes NPC&#39;s it wasn&#39;t my client because on a different server it was the glitched NPC&#39;s.</description>
