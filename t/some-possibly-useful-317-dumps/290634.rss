I just thought I would provide a few files that contain information that&#39;s I&#39;ve pulled from the cache:

[size=24pt]NOTE: This is to be used with servers. I don&#39;t believe it has any data that would be useful in client development...[/size]

Items.txt:
Contains the basic information. Item Name, Description, Members-only, Stackable.
[code]
[0]
Name:	Dwarf remains
Description:	The body of a Dwarf savaged by Goblins.
Stackable:	false
Members-only:	true
[End of Item][/code]

Npcs.txt:
Contains Name, Description, Combat-Level, and Right-Click options.
[code]
[1]
Name:	Man
Description:	One of RuneScape&#39;s many citizens.
Option-1:	Talk-to
Option-2:	Attack
Option-3:	Pickpocket
Level:	2
[End of Npc]
[/code]

Objects.txt
Contains Name, Description, and Right-Click options.
[code]
[8510]
Name:	Yew tree
Description:	A Yew tree is growing in this tree patch.
Option-1:	Inspect
Option-2:	Guide
[End of Object][/code]

Interfaces.txt
Not really sure if this would be a list of interfaces, but more of a list of &quot;Frames&quot; in each Interface. Never the less, it contains the text that appears in the top left corner when you mouse-over something, frame text(if any), the Parent Interface(The actual interface), and the Child ID(The current frame).
[code]
[6939]
Top-left corner:	&quot;&quot;
Frame text:	Proceed with caution. If you go much further north you will enter the\nwilderness. This is a very dangerous area where other players can attack you!
Parent ID:	1908
Child ID:	6939
[End of Interface][/code]
