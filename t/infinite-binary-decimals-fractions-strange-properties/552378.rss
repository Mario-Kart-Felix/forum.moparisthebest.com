    <title>Infinite binary decimals (fractions) &amp; strange properties</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/infinite-binary-decimals-fractions-strange-properties/552378</link>
    <description>Just have a few things I&#39;ve been trying to understand and I need some help.

The first thing, I noticed on the way home, is that .8^5 = .32768, which is the same number as 2^15 (and 8^5) which is 32,768. 
What about decimals determines whether or not a decimal exponent will be the same with an appended decimal at the beginning?
I know the numbers .32768 and 32,768 have nothing in common besides the fact that they are represented similarly in base 10, but I&#39;m trying to understand what could produce a result like this in the first place. Does it have to do with (1-.2)^5, or something else that gives it an easier binary representation/calculation?

When I was trying to solve this, I ran into my second question, which relates to how many decimals have an infinite representation in binary. I was trying to understand how the representation of .8 in binary could be related to the representation of 8, but it turns out .8 is a repeating decimal (.1[1001...])
How can this be summed as a series to make it 1/2 (the .1) + .3 as the remainder [to equal .8]? I couldn&#39;t solve this sum, though wolframalpha was able to get the correct result of .3:

sum from 1 to infinity of (1/(2^(4n-2))+1/(2^(4n+1)))

I tried summing as an integral and got a very incorrect answer and wasn&#39;t sure where I went wrong. I ended with (1/4log2)*(1/[2^2) + 1/[2^5]) = , if that helps for comparison. That equals like .04 though so it&#39;s very wrong, I&#39;m just not sure how.

Thanks for anyone who tries to help. I don&#39;t currently have any math classes or know any math professors yet at uni so I wasn&#39;t sure who to ask these questions</description>

Thanks for the response</p>

<li>That’s very interesting. I suppose the bit with scientific notation makes sense</li>
<li>I meant I couldn’t find a way to <span class="bbcode-i">actually</span> calculate it. I’m able to understand the logic behind it, but actually doing it feels difficult.</li>
