    <title>2 Questions... (About A 508 Server)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-questions-about-a-508-server/336104</link>
    <description>I have 2 questions...

1. This one is about my problems making commands. I have several command generators and I tried all of them. What I want to do is make a command so when you type ::gnomecopter you get a gnomecopter (mods+). Well it wouldn&#39;t work at first (I kept getting compiling errors) so I did some research about the error I was getting (class, interface, or enum expected error) and found out what alot of people did to fix that was put // in front of it. So I put // in front of both lines of my command. The compiler worked, but sadly, the command still won&#39;t work. Any ideas of what I did wrong?

2. I recently found out 508 servers don&#39;t have client.java files (sorry I&#39;m new to coding..DON&#39;T MAKE FUN OF ME!!! :P) So now I&#39;m lost of where I put shop/npc/object etc. files. All I have about shops is &quot;Shopbuyconfig&quot; (Java File) and &quot;Shopbuyconfig.class&quot; (Class File) Where do I put shop/npc/object files?

Thanks!</description>

2. Um in 508 packaging it is more contructed towards sexyness… look somewhere in data it has objectspawn.cfg or              some crap[/quote]</p>
<p>I looked in bin\data and found objects (CFG File) but there’s nothing at all in it, just a blank document.</p>
