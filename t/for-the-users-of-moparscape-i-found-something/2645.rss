    <title>For The Users of MoparScape- I Found Something</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/for-the-users-of-moparscape-i-found-something/2645</link>
    <description>Hey I was world hopping buying some deaths and I thought... hey why not try world 0 i mean... That will surley get me 250. Well I wasn&#39;t expecting it to work but it did! Could this be Jagex&#39;s test server? I couldn&#39;t get past the welcome screen though... Then I had to close because it froze up. If you know why this happened please let me know. All my info came up like it would from a regular server, like my membership days left and such. If so I&#39;m pretty sure Jagex would have special commands on that server and would be more vulnerable, such as not setting it so you don&#39;t have to be a level 3 admin to use such commands as ::item. Just letting you guys know.

              <p>Lol Martin of course there is, haven’t you seen the pictures in the picture gallery? Those were all made in the test server. Mopar, I found out about the world 10 default when i accidently typed 131 instead of 121 and asked what world it was and was told it was 10. Thanks for the awesome client Mopar.</p>

              <p>Lol, no, the game froze up because you confused the hell out of the client. Like, one time I removed the ground code from the client and it got all confused and I got a error and froze. So, no, it’s not a test server, or you would’ve not froze. And a BIG no about the “::item” command. If they have that kinda command, it would probally be diffrent.</p>
<p>EDIT: Ooh, so that’s why Aryan went to world 76 every time? Becuase RegeX forgot to add random world procedure? Lol…</p>
