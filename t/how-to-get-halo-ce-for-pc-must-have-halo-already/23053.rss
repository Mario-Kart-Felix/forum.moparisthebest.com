    <description>Ever wanted to play Halo 2 maps on halo 1 for the pc?

Well, Today is your lucky day! Im going to show ya!


[b]Must have Halo: Combat Evolved (halo one for PC) And serial number! And Winrar[/b]

Ok First go here [url=http://hce.halomaps.org/index.cfm?pg=3&amp;fid=410]http://hce.halomaps.org/index.cfm?pg=3&amp;fid=410[/url] And download The Halo.exe program.

Info notes on it: [color=red]
[i][b]Title: Halo Custom Edition Game
Description: Halo Custom Edition Game (CE) installation archive. NOTE: You must have a copy of Halo PC to install this program Important update see details:
File: halocesetup_en_1.00.exe
Size: 178.3M  Date: 08/23/04
Media Type: 		Zip[/color]


[b]Now once your done with that I belive you have to put the serial number in ([i]I AM NOT SURE)[/i][/b]


Congratz you now Have Halo CE. Now this is exactly like halo, We wanna make it Fun don&#39;t we??

Now go to [url=http://hce.halomaps.org/]http://hce.halomaps.org/[/url]  This is the main map download website.  But dont just start downloading! There is a certain way to do it!

Ok here is a good H2 Map for pros! [url=http://hce.halomaps.org/index.cfm?pg=3&amp;fid=824]http://hce.halomaps.org/index.cfm?pg=3&amp;fid=824[/url]

Ok once your at the download screen:

[b][i][u]You must Open it with Winrar And save it here: &quot;C:Program Files Microsoft Games Halo Custom Edition maps&quot;[/u][/i][/b]

Now once your done with that.....Exit out of everything.....Click Your new Halo CE program it will now run like regular halo. The click &quot;multiplayer&quot; then &quot;Get list&quot; And Ha! You got Halo 2 maps for halo one on the PC.

You should see the name of the map it should look like this &quot;H2_Zanzibar&quot; Or something

[i][b]Trouble shooting:[/b][/i]

More notes on Directory:

IMPORTANT! First I must emphasize that all the files and maps contained on this website is for the Halo Custom Edition Game and NOT the standard Halo for PC game.

The Halo Custom Edition game (Halo CE) is a free unsupported upgrade and standalone program that will install alongside of your Halo PC game. Unlike Halo PC, the Halo CE game allows you to play and or create custom maps for multiplayer on-line play.

If you have installed the Halo CE game using the standard Windows installer then your installation directory is &quot;C:Program FilesMicrosoft GamesHalo Custom Edition&quot; There should be a maps folder under that directory. This is where the map files go.

Full Path: &quot;C:Program FilesMicrosoft GamesHalo Custom Editionmaps&quot;

To install a map file first be sure that Halo CE is NOT running. Using an archive program like WinZip or WinRaR or open the *.zip file and extract the *.map file and place it in your maps folder : &quot;C:Program FilesMicrosoft GamesHalo Custom Editionmaps&quot;.

Start Halo CE and go through the process of starting a LAN Server. Verify that the new map you installed is available.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make your own maps is way advanced for me but if you want the program go here!
