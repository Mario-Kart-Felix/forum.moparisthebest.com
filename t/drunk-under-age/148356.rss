    <title>Drunk under age?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/drunk-under-age/148356</link>
    <description>Drunk before you are 16 or 21?

Is it RIGHT TO DO or A GOOD IDEA for someone younger than 16 to be drunk?

I&#39;ve done it (The hang over is shit!)

DEBATE NOW.</description>

<p>I was reading shit about that. Like for instance, you get drunk, and end up stumbling upon an alley, with a barrel full of diamonds. The next morning, you most likely don’t remember anything. Later that night, you’re drunk again, and can remember more than when you were sober.<br>
Same thing can go with weed, but I preferably stay away from it now, because I sing in a band, and it’s ruining my lung’s capacity for air.</p>
<p>Who ever said I’m emo? Emo’s cut themselves, I sir, don’t do that. I guess my opinions piss people off, because they have nothing better to do, than sit on their computer flaming a 15 year old. Lol.</p>

Actually, there are many many many more recreational drug users than there are addicts. Most rec. drug users just hide it from people like you.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I know people who do it, but I don’t hang out with people who do it.[/quote]<br>
You don’t hang out aswell with be that uses alcohol or believes in a different faith then you?<br>
It’s stupid thinking you’re the best and then end up being a normal worker like millions others, even millions of drugs/alcohol users.</p>
<p>I drink regulary (about every weekend). I’m part of the smartest kids, I’m getting to university in 2 years. I know people who uses wheed and they are on the same level as me. I know a lot more people using weed, who ore one level lower, but still the smarter part of civilisation. So don’t say, people who uses anything related to drugs will become fucked ups.<br>
You only see people like Britney, who completly abuses drugs/alcohol and then get a fucked up. But that’s the small part.<br>
In the Netherlands the goverment is discussing about full legalisation of soft drugs. Why? Because they can controll the quality of it. So that people smoke good weed and not some shitty stuff. It’s legal to have / use it already. Everyone is aloud to have 6 weed plants, for personal use. If it was realy as bad as you say, then it wouldn’t be legal.</p>

from a completely non biased view, its quite obvious that drugs are way too over dramatized by the government/media. based on facts: weed cant kill you, weed isnt addictive, weed wont make you poor.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>One major concern about marijuana is its possible effects on young people as they grow up. Research shows that the earlier people start using drugs, the more likely they are to go on to experiment with other drugs. In addition, when young people start using marijuana regularly, they often lose interest and are not motivated to do their schoolwork. The effects of marijuana can interfere with learning by impairing thinking, reading comprehension, and verbal and mathematical skills. Research shows that students do not remember what they have learned when they are “high”.[/quote]</p>
<p>thats just a statistic. it doesn’t mean you will try other drugs…</p>
<p>edit: oops on the not boze post</p>

<p>But what’s the point of living for it? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>That question can go on and on, we could be here for years debating that.</p>
<p>I can see the difference, it’s just my opinion is very strong against any drug use. I’ve lost alot of friends because of them using drugs. That’s why I feel so strongly about it.</p>

<p>Exactly, now we are getting somewhere.</p>
<p>I never denied irresponsible, heavy use of drugs could cause these things.</p>
<p>We are talking here about responsible, recreational drug use.</p>
<p>Can you see the difference? Because if not, this debate is pointless.</p>

<p>from a completely non biased view, its quite obvious that drugs are way too over dramatized by the government/media. based on facts: weed cant kill you, weed isnt addictive, weed wont make you poor.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>One major concern about marijuana is its possible effects on young people as they grow up. Research shows that the earlier people start using drugs, the more likely they are to go on to experiment with other drugs. In addition, when young people start using marijuana regularly, they often lose interest and are not motivated to do their schoolwork. The effects of marijuana can interfere with learning by impairing thinking, reading comprehension, and verbal and mathematical skills. Research shows that students do not remember what they have learned when they are “high”.</p>
<p>Long-term regular users of marijuana may become psychologically dependent. They may have a hard time limiting their use, they may need more of the drug to get the same effect, and they may develop problems with their jobs and personal relationships. The drug can become the most important aspect of their lives.</p>
<p>Silver, the point of life, is something we will never know. What I do know is, the point of life can be whatever you want it to be.</p>

Of course life has a point. To learn, to play, to be satisfied, to influence others, and so many other things can be viewed as the point of life. Life is a wonderful thing, and to say it is pointless is just stupid. Go cut yourself, or whatever you do in your spare time, but stop spewing shit you saw on TV out of your mouth and go do something you enjoy, or even try something new. There’s no point sitting in your chair and trying to sway your e-fellows if you don’t know your own position. Fix yourself, then fix us.</p>
