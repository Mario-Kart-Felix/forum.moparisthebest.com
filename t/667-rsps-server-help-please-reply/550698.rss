    <title>667 RsPs Server Help (Please Reply!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-rsps-server-help-please-reply/550698</link>
    <description>I downloaded the &quot;Poanizer&quot; Project source and client. It&#39;s an amazing client and I really enjoy it.

I&#39;ve made myself owner on the server, I&#39;ve changed a couple of customs and added a few, but the only issue is

I CAN&#39;T FIND OUT HOW TO SET MY STATS.

667 Character files are anti-leech files, making it so people can&#39;t make themselves owner (unless you are the true owner of the server).

I&#39;ve looked everywhere and I can&#39;t find out how to change my stats to 99&#39;s (for obvious reasons, I&#39;m the owner.)

If you have any information on how you can help or what-not, please reply to this forum post or message me on skype @     dylan.burns.96155 

Thanks!</description>

WOW… Why would you even go there, if you don’t have even a clue on how to do anything. In every server you have (Master) 600+ Servers characters are encrypted… therefore, if you open the charac’s files, you won’t really be able to view anything…<br>
Study up on it, then start.<br>
Go to " Commands.java " THen, search for " master " or " god " Then it should be there and if not, it’s very simple to create a command, many tutorials are avil here.</p>
