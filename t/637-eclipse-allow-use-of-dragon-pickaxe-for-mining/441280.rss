    <title>[637][Eclipse]Allow use of dragon pickaxe for mining</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/637-eclipse-allow-use-of-dragon-pickaxe-for-mining/441280</link>
    <description>My server has the d pick in the game, you can equip it and everything about it works besides the most important thing...you can&#39;t use it for mining. Any help to getting it to use for mining would be great.

EDIT:NVM, I figured it out. Thought it was harder than just adding the pickaxe ID, level requirement and animation ID to the mining.java file.</description>
