<p>Now, I was wondering about the platemail… I notice the red bit arround his neck… either it should not be red, or you are trying to make it look like a zaromak platemail, in which there should be an image on the front of it, and the shoulders should be outlined in red as well. Another thing that I noticed is that each of his hands only have 3 fingers. You might want to fix that up.[/quote]</p>

              <h2>
<span class="bbcode-b">Pixel</span> -<br>
Honestly, although it looks like you put in a lot of effort (which not many people do), it is terrible. For starters… if his feet are both turned to the right, the rest of his body shouldbe as well. If you want to make any of it facing the screen, the only part that you should do that with, is the head. Next, I understand why he is blue inside the helmet thing, but why is his neck blue below it. It should be the same color as his hands.</h2>
<h2>Now, I was wondering about the platemail… I notice the red bit arround his neck… either it should not be red, or you are trying to make it look like a zaromak platemail, in which there should be an image on the front of it, and the shoulders should be outlined in red as well. Another thing that I noticed is that each of his hands only have 3 fingers. You might want to fix that up.</h2>
<h2>Now for the shading… most of it isn’t too bad, but I was wondering about the shadow… if that is a spade he is holding, why does it’s shadow have horns? Also, the elbow part of his shadow is much too large. It makes him look like one of his bones are popping out. Finally, for the shading part that is, why is there no shadow from the cat thing?</h2>
<h2>Alright… now for the stars… If you want to have shading in a picture, they should either not have stars, or they need a moon to go along with it. Light creates shadow. That light either needs to be from the sun, in which place, there would be no stars, or from the moon, in which case, you need a moon.</h2>
<h2>Now for the background… You need to do something here. Just stars are not enough. There needs to be a horizon line, vegitation, and possibly a few buildings.</h2>
<p>Lastly, for the cat thing… I don’t have much to say except that in a pixel, you should never use pure black as a base color. If anything, use dark grey. That way, you still have the option to shade. If you use black, you cannot shade. Also, the face of the cat thing is terrible… Either it is one of those experiment things, in which case, it’s whole head should be human, or it is a cat, in which case, you need to make it the same color as the rest of the creature.</p>

Awesome job. I love the way that you used both brushes and transparencies to make it look the way that it does. I only have two small suggestions. Firstly, the transparent bar where the text is, is too dark. It should be the same as the other “rays” that you have there, or if anything, only a tiny bit darker. Lastly, I love all of the text except for the “j” which is too small. I suggest either making it, alone, either a larger size, or a different font style.</p>

Very basic, but still quite effective. You might want to try making the background transparent though. Other than that, the only problem that I see is that is takes too long to actually get to the animated part. You might just want to take out the first few frames or speed up the frames per second.</p>

<p>Hope this all helped you out,</p>
