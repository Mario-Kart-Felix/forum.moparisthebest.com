    <title>RichScape PK (v3) Problems -.- [PROBLEM SOLVED, TNX TO ME]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/richscape-pk-v3-problems-problem-solved-tnx-to-me/230607</link>
    <description>I downloaded RichScape PK (v3) from http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,247010.0.html

I opened it, played a bit, and realised, mining, agility and farm XP are very very slow!

So, i opened client.java file, and looked for mining XP.
I found this.
[code]        case 2094: // tin
        case 2095:
	if (actionTimer == 0) {
			setAnimation(624);
		if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1265 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1267 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1269 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1271 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1273 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1275) {//stuff		
		addSkillXP(50, 14);
            addItem(438, 1);
		actionTimer = 10;
		sendMessage(&quot;You Mine some Tin ore.&quot;);
		}else{
		sendMessage(&quot;You need a pickaxe to mine this.&quot;);
	}
}
                break;


            
	    case 2092:
            case 2093: // mining iron ore, second rock type [1]
		if (playerLevel[14] &gt;= 15) {	
			if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1265 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1267 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1269 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1271 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1273 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1275) {//stuff	
				if (actionTimer == 0) {
				setAnimation(624);		
				addSkillXP(75, 14);
            			addItem(440, 1);
				actionTimer = 10;
				sendMessage(&quot;You mine some Iron ore.&quot;);
				}
			} else if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] != 1265 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] != 1267 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] != 1269 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] != 1271 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] != 1273 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] != 1275) {//stuff		
				sendMessage(&quot;You need a pickaxe to mine this.&quot;);
			}
		} else if (playerLevel[14] &lt;= 14) {
			sendMessage(&quot;You need 15 mining to mine this type of ore&quot;);
		}
	break;[/code]

There was more of those .. Coal, Mithril, Addy and Rune.

All were low xp..

So I changed to XP&#39;s:
[code]		addSkillXP(50, 14);[/code]
From 50 Xp to 500 XP.
I saved it, compiled it and reran the serv, but the xp was still the same...

Then i tried to add this:
[code]		addSkillXP(50 * playerLevel[14], 14);[/code]

Still the same... Didn&#39;t work.

Then I tried to change the Miningtimers ...
[code]		actionTimer = 10;[/code]
From 10 to 1, but still the same. Did not work, mining was still low...

What could be the problem? Did I do anything wrong??

Can anybody post the correct version of this?
[code]                break;


            
	    case 2092:
            case 2093: // mining iron ore, second rock type [1]
		if (playerLevel[14] &gt;= 15) {	
			if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1265 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1267 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1269 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1271 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1273 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 1275) {//stuff	
				if (actionTimer == 0) {
				setAnimation(624);		
				addSkillXP((750, 14);
            			addItem(440, 1);
				actionTimer = 1;
				sendMessage(&quot;You mine some Iron ore.&quot;);
				}
			} else if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] != 1265 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] != 1267 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] != 1269 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] != 1271 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] != 1273 || playerEquipment[playerWeapon] != 1275) {//stuff		
				sendMessage(&quot;You need a pickaxe to mine this.&quot;);
			}
		} else if (playerLevel[14] &lt;= 14) {
			sendMessage(&quot;You need 15 mining to mine this type of ore&quot;);
		}
	break;
