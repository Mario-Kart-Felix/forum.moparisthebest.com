    <title>Fixing 0xC000021A STOP error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixing-0xc000021a-stop-error/515575</link>
    <description>I was trying to turn on one of my old computers, (from 2004 I think), and it gave me the 0xC000021A STOP error.  This error occurs when a user-mode subsystem, such as WinLogon or the Client Server Run-Time Subsystem (CSRSS), has been fatally compromised and security can no longer be guaranteed. In response, the operating system switches to kernel mode. Microsoft Windows cannot run without WinLogon or CSRSS. Therefore, this is one of the few cases where the failure of a user-mode service can shut down the system.

Could I fix it by booting XP from a USB, and would I need the installation disk?  (I haven&#39;t really looked into fixing it yet, and if it seems like I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, that&#39;s because I don&#39;t).</description>

              <p>I would just backup your data and format/reinstall windows. Which is very easy with an XP cd.</p>
<p>There is probably a way to fix it. But I’ll bet it would benefit better with a fresh install.</p>
