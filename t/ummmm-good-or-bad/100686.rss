              <p>Log Viewed obivously Means either you viewed the log or someone else. Check your router ip for the computer your on, if its not you, Do you have a WEP Key, you should. and i find it kinda impossible because some routers only allow remote assitance if you put the IP of a specified computer.</p>
<p>The Blocked Connections is someone that sees your router on a network and tries to get on it, but it blocks it because they do not have sufficient information to get on your network(if you have WEP, im guessing thats why its doing that) or someone is trying to hack into your router, i’ll port scan the ip, brb…</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>84.251.72.57 —&gt; Dead<br>
202.97.238.201 —&gt; Alive!, Strange no ISP?<br>
87.94.12.24 —&gt; Dead<br>
60.11.125.53 —&gt; Dead<br>
84.84.144.114 —&gt; Dead<br>
24.64.112.218 —&gt; Dead</p>
<p>Most of them are dead, one is alive, but no ISP? How Slow? it responds at 500ms…Boo hoo.</p>
