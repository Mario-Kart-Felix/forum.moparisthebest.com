&lt;blockquote&gt;/tg/station 13 is a paranoia-laden roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station. The game is 2D, sprite, and tile-based. It&#39;s written in BYOND, which accounts for its attrocious controls and limited graphical capability. Despite its shortcomings, it&#39;s amazingly fun for what it is. Prepare to lose many hours to it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
i&#39;ve been playing on byond://play.insertplayer.com:1336, it&#39;s pretty cool. unfortunately i&#39;m still a bit new, having fun wandering around and joining cults, electrifying soda machines and getting free cigarettes though... also accidentally disabling power and electrocuting myself in the waste disposal area...</description>
