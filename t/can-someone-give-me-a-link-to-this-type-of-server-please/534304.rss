              <p>Most all 317’s have that capability, go in to the Commands.java (This is if you’re using a PI) and search this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Then copy the entire code and move it under this</p>
<p><code> public void playerCommands(Client c, String playerCommand)
    {</code></p>
<p>Make sure you delete the previous line after moving it and always make a backup of the original file.</p>
