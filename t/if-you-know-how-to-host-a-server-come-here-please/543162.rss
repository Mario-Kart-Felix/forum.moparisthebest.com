              <p>Open up command prompt and type “ipconfig” and memorize the number next to default gate.</p>
<p>Go into your internet browser and type in that number, enter the required credentials, if you don’t know try “admin” as the username and look underneath your router to see the factory password.</p>
<p>Some people have different routers so look for something that has ports inside it, for mine it is under the Applications &amp; Gaming tab.</p>
<p>Fill out all the spaces, enable both the TCP and UDP and enter a port that isn’t used - preferably something between 2000 and 4000</p>
<p>Save the settings, make sure your no-ip is redirecting to your correct port and give the details to your buddy</p>
<p>That should allow your server to receive connections</p>

              <p>First enable the port of your server on the firewall you are using. Go to <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> to see if your ip is blocking the port used.</p>
<p>I’m hoping you know how to portforward, if you do then start changing the defalt ip on your server to your no-ip. Make sure if you want to keep your server online with No-Ip, the No-Ip software must be running at all times.</p>
