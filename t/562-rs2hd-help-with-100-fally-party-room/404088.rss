    <title>[562][rs2hd] Help with 100% Fally Party Room?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-rs2hd-help-with-100-fally-party-room/404088</link>
    <description>Well here&#39;s my situation with trying to develop the &quot;Falador Party Room&quot;

I&#39;m using GazaaScape&#39;s source which apparently has the chest and lever (with knights on table autospawned) but the chest only sends the 647 interface (which is right) but you cannot add items to the chest (the inventory items can only be wielded and not used) and the accept button probably doesn&#39;t work. Now in terms of code, I have added a
[code]public static int partyRoomTimer[/code]
to the GameEngine.java with an
[code]if(partyRoomTimer == 0) {
partyRoomTimer = 60; }[/code]

The cases in Object1PacketHandler.java are present (for the balloons and the chest and lever) but have no code set for actually adding the items and triggering the dropping.
here&#39;s what I got.

[code]case 118:
            player.WalkTo().WalkTo(player, x, y);
            int dropitem3 = Misc.random(3);
                if(dropitem3 == 0) {
                    player.getInventory().addItem(1038, 1);
                }
                if(dropitem3 == 1) {
                    player.getInventory().addItem(1040, 1);
                }
                if(dropitem3 == 2) {
                    player.getInventory().addItem(1042, 1);
                }
                if(dropitem3 == 3) {
                    player.getInventory().addItem(14484, 1);
                }
            player.getActionSender().deleteStaticObject(0, x, y);
            break;[/code] //balloon
[code]case 26193:
			player.WalkTo().GoTo(player, x, y-1);
			player.getActionSender().sendInterface(647, true);
			player.resetAttack();
			player.getUpdateFlags().setForceTextUpdateRequired(true);
			player.sm(&quot;How generous of you to donate your hard-earned items!&quot;);
			break;][/code] //Chest
[code]case 26194:
			player.WalkTo().GoTo(player, x, y-1);
			player.resetAttack();
			player.animate(6104);
			player.getUpdateFlags().setForceTextUpdateRequired(true);
			player.sm(&quot;You pull the lever.&quot;);
			break;[/code] //lever

So there you have it. What I need help with is with the right code to tie it all together (code + where I should put it) The goal is to utilize the interface 647 COMPLETELY and then use the lever to start the party (and if the lever isn&#39;t pulled before the timer ends, it&#39;s automatically started)
I want the chest to be able to show items you want to add, also display the countdown timer, and then when the accept button is pressed, items are added to the display along with any other player&#39;s items that were added, and then when the timer ends (or the lever is pulled (I want to make the player rights on that like 1+) the items displayed in the &quot;going to drop&quot; slide menu are transferred to the &quot;dropping&quot; slide menu and then randomly put in the party balloons and dropped! (You also have to stomp on the balloon first to get the item)

If anyone could guide me through this process COMPLETELY (I already looked at several threads that abruptly ended without solving much) my players and I would appreciate it.
