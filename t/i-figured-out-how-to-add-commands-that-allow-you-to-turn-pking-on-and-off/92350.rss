    <title>I figured out how to add commands that allow you to turn pking on and off</title>

    <description>After about 2+ hours (I&#39;m not even kidding) I finnaly got two commands working that I made that allow you to turn pking in your existing pk server off with simple commands.  You have to find and change a lot of things.  It took so long because I was starting from a command I had heard of in another server and went from there.  Anyway now it&#39;s working.  Do you guys think I should make a tut on how I did it?  It would be my first tut.  It would be pretty long though too, anyway I just wanted your guys opionon.</description>

<p>I just coded in glows for pmod admins and owner, but that was a lot easier but I still did it myself, it’s not as much as a triumph as the first code though.  It feels much better when it wasn’t working and yada yada when you finnaly get it working.[br][size=1]Posted on: May 10, 2007, 05:54:42 PM[/size][hr]can somebody point me to the tutorial…maybe I can make a better one <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
