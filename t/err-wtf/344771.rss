    <title>Err... Wtf?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/err-wtf/344771</link>
    <description>Just been messing around with my cache and other such hilarities (not class8) and afterwards when I was done both anti-dragon shield and opal bolts models had both dissapeared.

so, does anyone know how to fix this or where I can find the 317 models for both of these items? Even after I tried to replace both of these items in class 8 the models dissapeared, its almost as if if you use that item ID there is no model despite doing anything else ever.

anyone help?</description>
