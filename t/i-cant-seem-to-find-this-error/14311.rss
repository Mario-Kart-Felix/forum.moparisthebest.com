    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-cant-seem-to-find-this-error/14311</link>
    <description>hmm, whats the problem with the SRL include?

[Runtime Error] : Exception: Access violation at address 0065154B in module &#39;SCAR.EXE&#39;. Read of address 00000000 in line 620 in script C:FILESSCARincludessrlsrlcoreText.scar

My SRL is seemingly correct installed, as i can run this without problems.
Program New;
{.include SRL/SRL.scar}

Begin
  SetupSRL;
  FindNormalRandoms;
end.[br][size=1]Posted at: September 14, 2006, 08:56:52 AM[/size][hr]
Heheheh, Never mind folks. Classic beginner flaw. I managed to fix it  ;)</description>

              <p>Yes Ron,. But thats not were the problems started. If you read the line over the script you understand that I only posted the script to show that i had installed SRL properly, to avoid people telling me that i probably just had installed/set-up srl wrong. Anyway everything is good now  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">   Sorry for any missunderstandings.</p>

              <p>It is probably many different causes to create this error.<br>
But i found out that one of the reasons are if you declare " SetUpSRL; " after you have called upon rsl functions such as FindNormalRandoms;. As it seems that SetUpSRL needs to be declared first  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
