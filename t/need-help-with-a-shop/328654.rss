    <title>Need help with a shop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-a-shop/328654</link>
    <description>I have a shop, when you trade it, it has logs, seeds, and stuff for herby, BUT when you TALK to her she shows LOADS of combat items.

How can i make it to where you u click &#39;talk&#39; it doesn&#39;t have all those item, this person is for a skilling area area and i don&#39;t want to talk to it and have combat things, just skilling. Soo how do i take it off where when you talk it has just text or nothing happens instead of a window to buy items..</description>

<p>This part:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">WanneShop = 6;</code></pre>
<p>determins what shop gets opened, in this case, the shop with the shop ID 6.<br>
These shop ID’s can be set (and found) in the file shops.cfg</p>
<p>So yes, it is possible to just keep the items. All you have to do, is assign the shop to a different npc <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>So for your problem with the 2 shops on 1 Npc, check if the ID after WanneShop is equal to the ID of the shop you want to open.</p>

              <p>Alrighty, great thanks =D.</p>
<p>But, what about all the items that it shows when you click ‘talk’ i’d like to keep them all, is there a way i can transfer them to another shop like a combat shop where u actually trade it and its not sharing two shops?</p>
<p>Btw, i type in case 155 look for the id and don’t see it so i type in 529 -the id of the npc- and the first thing i get is this…</p>
<p><code>if (NPCID == 529) {
				PutNPCCoords = true;
				WanneShop = 6; 
} </code></p>

<p>This is the case that handles what happens when you click on an NPC (the talk function)<br>
Search for the ID of the NPC which has the shop, and change the shopnumber that you find there to the correct shop number (Or dialogue, if you want to use one)</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
