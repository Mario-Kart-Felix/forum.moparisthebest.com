    <title>Crypted - Text Based Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/crypted-text-based-game/383145</link>
    <description>Crypted is a text based game using RS content.
I used the basic source Epic Steve showed me , and i didn&#39;t really do all that much , i deleted a few classes and added 2 methods and started coding , but that&#39;s really all you need with a text based game anyways....
So yeah , credits to Epic Steve =D

so far i&#39;ve got [b]mining[/b] , [b]woodcutting[/b] and [b]smelting[/b] up.
without the lvl reqs because i still have to write lvl updating.
Also , player saving / loading hasnt been added yet but im working on it =D
In the future i will also add some sort of combat to it , idk how but it will definately be turn based...

the commands are added in the readme file

<p>lemme check , …<br>
user , room , roomdata and item classes , also editted the remaining files so the only remaining thing is the input of strings and making them appear on the screen.</p>
