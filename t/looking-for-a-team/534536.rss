    <title>Looking for a team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-team/534536</link>
    <description>Hi my name is Brandon I&#39;m 23 just bought my first house and finally have the time and space to host/run my own server

Looking for a team to launch a new server/client/website

I already have a dedicated server to run 10meg inet 

I am not 100% on what source I want to start with but I would like to keep it old school

I would like to have worldwide content with no dedicated home area And keep it very close to home rs was in the good old days 

I am looking for some people that can code server side, or HTML experience, people with good ideas to add to the bunch, client side coding
