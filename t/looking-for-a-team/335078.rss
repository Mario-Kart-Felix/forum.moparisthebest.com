    <title>Looking For A Team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-team/335078</link>
    <description>Welcome.

My name is Jackson, and I am the owner of NovaScape. Let me just say it&#39;s nice to see that you&#39;ve taken part of your time to view this thread, and that you may be interested in applying to be part of the NovaScape Team.

Why I am looking for a team:
Well, I would like NovaScape to continue with great progression. I would like it to be a server that many people play, and a server that inspires people to create their own. I think having a team, would make this be much easier that being a solo act.

A bit about NovaScape:
NovaScape is currently a 317 RuneScape private server. It gets updated constantly, so that players keep playing. It is a well built server. I have taken time and patience to listen to the NovaScape players, on what they think I should add to NovaScape, so that they feel comfortable playing.

Goals for NovaScape:
I would like NovaScape to be a successful server, that many people play. I want it to inspire people to create their own server, to build the RuneScape Private Server economy. I would like it to be a place for people to play, hangout, just chill, and have fun. I would also like to make NovaScape have a great economy, not like a server that people can get easy levels, etc, otherwise the quicker they get it, the quicker they get bored, the quicker they quit. 

Future plans for NovaScape:
As I previously mentioned, I plain on making NovaScape a successful &#39;RSPS&#39;, that many play. Even though that I know this will take a lot of work, I plan on making NovaScape cover all RSPS &#39;Platforms&#39; (RuneScape Classic, 317, 474, 508, 525, 562, and possibly higher). I plan on starting at 317, then going higher, then most likely going to RS-Classic.

What I am looking for:
- A good coder, that has a wide knowledge of RuneScape, and Private Servers.
- Somebody that is friendly, and is willing to meet others.
- Somebody that doesn&#39;t give up, somebody that can truly stick to something.
- Somebody that does not lie, even if they make a small mistake, it&#39;s alright.
- Somebody that doesn&#39;t use others.
- Somebody that has the compatibility of working with another.
- Somebody that has the compatibility of working with all RSPS &#39;Platforms&#39; (look above on what I mean by &quot;Platforms&quot;)
- Somebody that isn&#39;t new to the community.

Current NovaScape Development Staff:
- Myself

NovaScape currently has a fully functioning website, that you can all access.
Visit the website at: www.novascape.tk
Please note that I will remove the link, if asked by a member of the staff.

I know that may be alot to ask, but I really wish for NovaScape to be a successful server.

Thank you, and hopefully I will see you on the team.
- Jackson.</description>
