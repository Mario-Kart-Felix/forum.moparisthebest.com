    <title>Looking for a team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-team/411264</link>
    <description>Basically this board is for assembling a team for game development.

If you&#39;re looking for a team (and not assembling one) it&#39;d be nice if you kept your thread title to just &quot;LFT - (position here)&quot;, that way those who are assembling teams can post &quot;Looking for _____, ____, ____&quot;

Consider creating a thread in the development board once you have something to show!</description>
