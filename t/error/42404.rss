    <description>Ok can someone tell me how to fix this?

It started happening when I updated my server, I took some stuff outta the shops and saved it.
(NOTE: I didnt TAKE it out i just changed the ammount to 0)

Then I ran the complier, then I ran the Server.
(NOTE: Im using the &#39;Perfect Compiler&#39; thing)

This is what I got then when I tried to log in, it said Already logged in and then said Server was down.
