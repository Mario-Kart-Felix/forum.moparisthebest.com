    <description>Well, I have been looking at Runescape Private for a long time, and I decided to try it, but when I try running MoparScape, It says Downloading File, and sometimes it wont finish, It just exits out. Some times It will be at 2-4% and one time I was at 96% (Which is good seeing as I am on dial up). I was wondering if there is anything special I need to run it? I have Java Version 1.4.2_03 (build 1.4.2_03-b02).
Please help, I would love to play one soon. :D</description>
