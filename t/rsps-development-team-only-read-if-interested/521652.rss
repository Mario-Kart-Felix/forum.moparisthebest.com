    <title>Rsps development team - only read if interested@</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-development-team-only-read-if-interested/521652</link>
    <description>         First I&#39;d like to start by saying, I am sorry if this is the wrong place to post this; If it is please correct me!
I am looking for a dedicated and small RSPS development and coding team that wants to make a nice server.
I want it to be a 2006 or 317 based server with none of that 600+ shit, but if you guys want that, I can deal with it!
I have not much java knowledge(lets say 6 months -still novice and learning) I have to say, the classes I&#39;m taking are catching me up!
        We will decide on base when we get a chance to talk. You can keep the donations and I will pay you if I have too.
I was looking for around a 3-4 person team. Some things I wanted to add are

            -Quest that unlock features(like Rune Mysteries)          -Runescape Quest         -Members only features             
            -Runescape eco system         -Tutorial Island            -All skills achievable
We will discuss more when we figure this out! -pm me if interested or post skype/msn below</description>
