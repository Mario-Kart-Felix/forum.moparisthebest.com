    <description>[b]I want to create my very own base client from scratch - Copying is for losers[/b] :D

Okay I&#39;ll start with saying [b]my knowledge in Java is VERY limited[/b]. I tried learning from youtube vids a while back (I know horrible).
I&#39;ll take all your insults because I know how annoying it is to help people new to something you know a lot about.

Any who, I&#39;m [b]hoping there is a guide for dummies[/b] of some sort.. I [b]don&#39;t want to take someone else&#39;s base client[/b] because I [b]don&#39;t want to learn bad habits[/b]. I actually want to try building my very own server from scratch.

Now I know the logical thing to do here would to give me something small to start with... But don&#39;t please. I&#39;m hoping one of you coding experts will give me a hand. What I mean is I&#39;ve[b] heard talk about this Apache Ant thing being the way to go (have no idea what it is exactly)[/b].. none of this small time shit :P

So if someone can point me in the right direction.. [b]A guide relevant to only making Runescape Private servers from Scratch AND I MEAN SCRATCH[/b]. Thats all I&#39;m interested in at the moment.


[b]My Goals[/b]
* Create a Base Client
* I know how to port forward etc.
* Already know how to spawn nps, get them to walk and teleports etc
* Spawn shops (had trouble with this one, but it may have been a bad base client - not from this site).
* Altar/create terrain and buildings/structures (have a mate with a diploma in 3D Animation)
* Altar/create models
[i]This is all for now[/i]</description>

              <p>I will help you with any of these goals as my knowledge is quite extensive on the topic. Kind of expecting since I lurked in the models section for 1.5 years.</p>

<p>I have never created terrain, but I know the concept and the tools needed. I also know the concept for making buildings. Models, I know practically everything about.</p>
<p>Edit: Don’t take this as bragging. :o Read it over and realized someone might take it that way…<br>
Also, all cool kids start out wanting to make their own client and server.<br>

<p>Read the comments, they might be helpful. 1 year down the line and I’m still stuck on Project Insanity lol. I’ve learnt a lot though, you will probably come back to creating a scratch server in a few years, as you will realise this is out of your grasp for now.</p>

It’s not someone elses work. It is the ORIGINAL 317 client (Well, a few variables and classes have been renamed and stuff). It’s nothing like anything in the download section it doesn’t have any new items or shit… As I said, it’s original.</p>

<p>Nice, but can you be a little more helpful? Where is the right section… and I don’t suppose you realised I mentioned I’m new. I don’t know much about Java so how would I know what goes into making a server until I try.</p>

<p>Okay I’ll start with saying <span class="bbcode-b">my knowledge in Java is VERY limited</span>. I tried learning from youtube vids a while back (I know horrible).<br>
I’ll take all your insults because I know how annoying it is to help people new to something you know a lot about.</p>
<p>Any who, I’m <span class="bbcode-b">hoping there is a guide for dummies</span> of some sort… I <span class="bbcode-b">don’t want to take someone else’s base client</span> because I <span class="bbcode-b">don’t want to learn bad habits</span>. I actually want to try building my very own server from scratch.</p>
<p>Now I know the logical thing to do here would to give me something small to start with… But don’t please. I’m hoping one of you coding experts will give me a hand. What I mean is I’ve<span class="bbcode-b"> heard talk about this Apache Ant thing being the way to go (have no idea what it is exactly)</span>… none of this small time shit <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>So if someone can point me in the right direction… <span class="bbcode-b">A guide relevant to only making Runescape Private servers from Scratch AND I MEAN SCRATCH</span>. Thats all I’m interested in at the moment.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">My Goals</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Base Client</li>
<li>I know how to port forward etc.</li>
<li>Already know how to spawn nps, get them to walk and teleports etc</li>
<li>Spawn shops (had trouble with this one, but it may have been a bad base client - not from this site).</li>
<li>Altar/create terrain and buildings/structures (have a mate with a diploma in 3D Animation)</li>
<li>Altar/create models<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">This is all for now</span>
</li>
</ul>
