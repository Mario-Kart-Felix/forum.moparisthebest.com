    <description>Hi, am going out to a friends party in an hour to a paintballing place.

I would like your views on which is better, and please [b]Do Not[/b] vote if you haven&#39;t played both of them, if you have only played one please post instead of voting.

I personally find airsoft way more fun.</description>

              <p>Airsoft looks amazing and very realistic. Paintball is amazingly fun when you get into it. I went to GCTAs paintball thingy and he had a smoke grenade … and set it off in our own base so all the other people were like “Wtf who was that?” I laughed loads. I want to play Airsoft with a FAMAS… omfg I love those guns!</p>

              <p>no our name isnt sponsored paintball team lol… its impending disaster here’s an article from along time ago on our team</p>
<p>First place Rookie, which included a set of Smart Parts Ions was grabbed by Impending Disaster.  Second place went to Mayhem, third to Stalkers and Fourth to the Sentinels.  For the novices, the first place team went home with a set of five DYE DM-6s as a part of their prize package.  These went to RNT out of South Florida, who fielded Max Dev Cyborgs through the event.  Second place went to First Down Blue, with Who Too in third and SAS Mayhem in fourth.</p>
<p>Despite not making their way into the final four, Crusaders earned enough points to maintain their rookie lead in the series rankings.  Whoo Too did the same, with a stronger finish in Palm Bay giving them an even stronger lead in the series.</p>
<p>From Palm Bay, the Florida State Sunshine Series heads back to Osceola Extreme Sports May before a return to Palm Bay in late July.</p>
<p>Editor’s Note – It has been quite gratifying to see our home field of Hurricane Paintball Park grow from an idea at the Palm Bay Parks and Recreation department into first a well laid out scenario field, and now an operating tournament site drawing teams from other parts of the state.</p>
<p>Osceola extreme sports is OES</p>

<p>Nice, you have the same gun as me. I also have a proto jersey and mask, lol. Around here it’s 40 dollars for 800 balls =/</p>
<p>Haven’t played a game for a long time, but we used to go inside a wood mill to play, it was sweet.</p>

<p>My friend shot me with an airsoft sniper rifle gun. I had to dig around my skin to pull it out. Usually when I’ve been shot with them, it might break the skin but bounces back out =/</p>
