    <description>I keep the items on death, but it doesn&#39;t keep in the invin:S It drops on the floor, but no one can see it!
So people have to run back and get there items that they are suppose to keep on death, how do I make it
so they keep it in their invin when they die? I am using InsidiaX!</description>

<p>Guess the first one is the main priority if you want all the items to be kept on death?</p>
