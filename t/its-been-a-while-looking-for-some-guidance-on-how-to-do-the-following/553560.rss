    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/its-been-a-while-looking-for-some-guidance-on-how-to-do-the-following/553560</link>
    <description>I want to do the following:

- Get an actual 317 source cache and client - not a 470~ cover.
- Create a blank map or edit it with the Runescape Map Editor to be redirected to how I can edit it in notepad/ in game.
- Setup spawning for resources(trees, rocks) throughout the amount on x,y positions with duration dependent on whether its been cut down and have collision check (for the following)
- Tinker with the Construction skill to change it to where you can place down a room and then have the server save its location even after restarts.

This is just a start of a project of mine, and it would be preference to obtain reference material or even a direction on how to start maneuvering towards achieving these.</description>

<p>First: You need experience in Java and programming.</p>
<p>Second: Download a 317 client. Don’t want that new revision shit? Don’t download one that has it. There’s plenty of releases that use the “original” 317/377 cache. <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/downloads/srcAllDummysRemoved.tar.gz" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here’s the original unmodified client MITB released/has.</a></p>
<p>Third: You will not be able to edit maps using a notepad without a lot of… jargon. It’d be easier to use a map editor. Also, as the cache needs to be sent to each client, live time (Or in game) editing may not be a possibility. I think with the current tools, the best you can do is load the cache in a program, edit it, save and repack, then reload the client.<br>
Here’s a tutorial for editing maps: <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,672088.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,672088.0.html</a></p>
<p>Fourth: Resource spawning is “easy”, but that depends on how you handle it. If you load your cache from the server (Which you should) you will be able to read where all trees/rocks/etc are. That will make it so you can verify the user is clicking on an existing object. From there, it’s simply checking a global list to see if the object is already in it, or if not, adding it to the list with X resources. And as the player harvests, the resources get taken off. At 0, the server spawns the “dead” version.</p>
<p>Fifth: I’m not understanding what you want done here? Construction works by using the <a href="https://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/317-Construct-map-region" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Construct Map Region</a> packet. If you want the server to “save” the location, then just save the data you used for the packet for later use.</p>
