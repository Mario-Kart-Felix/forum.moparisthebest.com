    <description>I don&#39;t really know where this belongs, and i suppose everything eventually ties into programming and this is designed for the F451 computing and programming exam so here we go.

[size=18pt]Network Topologies - Basic revision guide[/size]

Network Topoligies are - in a nutshell - how computers can connect and interact. There are several ways computers can interact:

[b][size=14pt]Bus network[/size][/b]

[b]            A         B         C[/b]
[IMG]http://i49.tinypic.com/35k79ue.jpg[/img]

A bus network is a network where all computers are connected via one cable called a BUS. All nodes on the system share the same backbone to connect to the network.

If node B wishes to connect with another node on the system, the line is first checked to see if a signal is being sent, as the bus line can only accept one connection at a time. In the result of the line being clear, a signal is sent from the node. The node knows to send the data to a specific machine id, so it will reject any other node on the system that does not match that id. Usually on a basic Bus network, fewer than 14 devices are connected. Any more than this, the network can suffer from performance issues.

[b]Packet collision[/b]

Simply put, if two packets are simultaneously sent down the Bus network cable, they collide and corrupt. The workstation however can recognise this and usually sends a random resend time.

[b]Advantages[/b]

&gt;Bus networks are very cheap to set up as they only have a few cables connected to the backbone and the backbone itself
&gt;Bus networks are easy to set up and relatively easy to maintain
&gt;Bus networks are ideal for a temporary cheap network situation.

[b]Disadvantages[/b]

&gt;If there is a problem with the backbone, the entire system will fail as all nodes are connected via this cable.
&gt;If one node fails, the whole network will fail.
&gt;Low security, as packets are not encrypted and are easy to intercept
&gt;The more nodes, the slower the network
&gt;Administration is difficult as there is no &quot;master&quot; of the network.
&gt;One virus on one node can affect all nodes


[b][size=14pt]Ring network[/size][/b]

[IMG]http://i49.tinypic.com/30acoqb.jpg[/img]

A ring network is very similar to a Bus network, except all ends are connected together. 

Packets are sent around the ring network to be picked up by the appropriate node. All data is sent around in the same direction, so packet collisions are rare. Packets from multiple nodes can be sent via the ring due to this.

[b]Advantages[/b]
&gt;Data transfer speeds are faster as you are only sending in one direction
&gt;Data transmission is simpler as all packets travel in one direction only
&gt;Due to the architecture of the Ring network, packet collisions are very rare

[b]Disadvantages[/b]
&gt;Data packets are passed through every node on the network which can slow down the network
&gt;The entire network is dependent on the ring cable, so if the cable is broken the network fails
&gt;If one of the nodes on the network fail, the network will cease
&gt;All nodes must be on for the network to be active
&gt;Finding problems on the ring can be difficult

[b][size=14pt]Star network[/size][/b]

[IMG]http://i49.tinypic.com/11ihg06.jpg[/img]

Star networks are now the most common type of network in existence. Simplistically, all connections are made to one hub or switch. The central hub acts as a connection point for all nodes within the network. 

This type of network is more secure than the others as data is sent straight to the central hubs, and is not transferred through every node on the system meaning that packet interception is not possible. All security for the network can be handled within the central hub.

This type of network is more expensive than the others, and can often require new hardware and sometimes new software. 

[b]Advantages:[/b]
&gt;No interception of packets
&gt;Compared to the other two, performs better
&gt;Easy to connect new nodes
&gt;If one node is down, it doesn&#39;t affect the network

[b]Disadvantages:[/b]
&gt;More expensive
&gt;Too much dependency on central device has its own drawbacks. If it fails whole network goes down
&gt;Performance and as well number of nodes which can be added in such topology is depended on capacity of central device.
