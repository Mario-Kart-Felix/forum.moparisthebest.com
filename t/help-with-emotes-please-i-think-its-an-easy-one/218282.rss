    <title>Help with emotes please? I think it&#39;s an easy one!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-emotes-please-i-think-its-an-easy-one/218282</link>
    <description>Ok. I have added some stuff so that you do some emotes and some graphics when you click a certain emote tab. But, I have 3 emotes set for the player to preform under the one action. My problem is that it only does the last emote. I need it to do the first emote, then the second, and then the last emote.

Here is what i currently have:
&lt;blockquote&gt;startAnimation(422);
																startAnimation(1125);
																startAnimation(2770);
																stillgfx(426, absY, absX);
																animationReset = System.currentTimeMillis() + 500;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, you click the emote &quot;Yes&quot; which in my server is called &quot;Steal&quot; and you do the emote as if you were drunk. And the stars are spinning around your head. But, if what i want works then it&#39;ll go a little something like this:
You do the emote like you are pickpocketing someone, then you get hit, then you have stars around you and you are drunk.


Thanks!</description>
