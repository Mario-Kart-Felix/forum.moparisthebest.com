              <p>[quote=“JavaTC, post:2, topic:445206”]There’s a new advertisement section here.<br>
Youtube sucks for advertising, most people from there don’t even know what revision is what.<br>
They usually quit quick because they think that communities build themselves and refuse to help with it.[/quote]<br>
wheres the advertisement section?</p>
<p>also another thing, i have a forum for my RSPS so the users can tell me what they think and how i can improve the game.</p>

              <p>To put it simply, People quit because of boredom.</p>
<p>If there is too much in the beginning, or if its too hard to get items, or if there is really nothing to do, they will simply quit.</p>
<p>You have to make your server feel “inviting” and unique, so people will waste hours on it.</p>

              <p>A lot of people who host servers don’t realise that content is viewed from two perspectives, it’s viewed from the point of how up to date it is and how flawless it is. Players generally don’t look for how up to date the content is, they like to play a server where everything runs smoothly, with very, very few glitches. For example, 667/718’s are very popular these days, but a lot of them don’t have trade. The few that do have trade it isn’t working 100% and is very glitchy and buggy, therefore users lose items in some circumstances. I realise that this is a huge pull factor if you say it is one of the few 667’s with working trade, but, users will quickly up and leave when they see all of the glitches. So, my pro tip to you would be to get all of your content 100% working smoothly before you advertise it, or before you host the server as this will get you players who stick with the server. You must also have a user friendly and a nice, welcoming community. If they log on and they’re bombarded by trolls, they will simply leave.</p>
<p>Feel free to PM me for further help.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
