This is a 201 client, and 201 server, the server is stripped down completely (30kb) it only contains walking and chatting, also multiplayer.

I&#39;ve added gameobjects, and gamewallobjects

Gameobjects work 100%
Gamewallobjects (doors ect) is fucked, and I have no idea whats causing the problem, it seems only south facing door frames will load or actually, only some south facing will load, the rest don&#39;t, but sometimes when you walk around, close to door openings, door frames will randomly appear beside your character (not where they should be but close), and sometimes walls randomly appear, I think that&#39;s the update gamewallobjects packet, but yeah if someone could take the time to look over the server sauce it&#39;d be much appreciated, it&#39;s only a 30kb src, in the download the gameobjects are blanked out not to load, but the wall objects are set to load. a few keywords to search for:

client_Handler.java -&gt; update() method (right at the bottom of the file this is where gameobjects are blanked atm)
load_gameWallObjects.java , load_gameObjects.java(idk maybe to compare)


server.java -&gt; load_gameObjects.load_Definitions() (is blanked atm)
load_gameWallObjects.load_Definitions()


and finially,

player.java -&gt; append_Game_Objects()
and append_game_wall_objects()

I really need the door frames working :\

Thanks.</description>
