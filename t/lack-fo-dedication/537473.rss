    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lack-fo-dedication/537473</link>
    <description>Why is it that so many server owners lack any dedication to their server.  I&#39;ve been getting into them again recently, and every server I join anymore either has a giant ass player reset, shuts down, and/or hires the worst staff in the world.

I don&#39;t mind this at times as the flaws can typically be overlooked in most cases, it&#39;s a part of life that nothing is perfect.

But one thing pisses me off more than anything.  When the server shuts down, it&#39;s typically because &quot;I&#39;m bored of it&quot;.

I&#39;m just wondering as to why so few people are actually dedicated to the server and the work others put into it?</description>

All depends on the person.  I personally find it quite reprehensible since loosing valuable gear because I’m willing to place trust in someone.  Then again, with Runescape the way it is, all is fair in love and war.</p>

<p>I’d say maturity has more to do with it quite honestly since dedication typically comes with age as your discover your talents.  I just wish some of them would at least practice dedication of some kind rather than just drop the whole thing all together, seems like a bit of a waste.</p>

              <p>Why is it that so many server owners lack any dedication to their server.  I’ve been getting into them again recently, and every server I join anymore either has a giant ass player reset, shuts down, and/or hires the worst staff in the world.</p>
<p>I don’t mind this at times as the flaws can typically be overlooked in most cases, it’s a part of life that nothing is perfect.</p>
<p>But one thing pisses me off more than anything.  When the server shuts down, it’s typically because “I’m bored of it”.</p>
<p>I’m just wondering as to why so few people are actually dedicated to the server and the work others put into it?</p>
