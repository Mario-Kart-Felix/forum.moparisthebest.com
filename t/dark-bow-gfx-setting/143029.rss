    <title>Dark bow Gfx setting?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dark-bow-gfx-setting/143029</link>
    <description>Oi, i finally got my dark bow to work, but does anyone know where to put in the gfx setting?
like to show the arrow going through the air, it doesnt have to be double shot, i just want to see the arrow..
:l
so yea, link me to a tut, or post a tut, or just give me the code to copy and paste.




(one of the last things i need to do before releasing kittyscape source, the fully compatable source with silabsoft)
