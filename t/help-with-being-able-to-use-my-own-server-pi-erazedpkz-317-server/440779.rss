    <description>I need help being able to actually login to my Rsps server using the client it was provided with it inside the package folder. it isnt letting me. Please someone help me out. 
Here is the link to the source+client im using : http://www.runelocus.com/forums/show...st-Combat!-602

It isnt letting me fully sign into my own server it will sign in but then say &quot;connection lost&quot; and sign me back out. Please someone help me fix this problem so i can get online my own server and be able to see the Changes i need to make to it and also see what the server is like. Thank you !</description>
