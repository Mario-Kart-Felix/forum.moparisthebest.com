    <title>[PI] Farming Patches?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-farming-patches/404952</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve noticed that when I added a tree patch where you put in the herb and the herb pops up grown, it grows over in catherby, which is where the other farming patch is. (I copied the other farming patch&#39;s ID.)


I found this. What should I do with it? I&#39;ve tried adding that same thing with the co-ordinates of the farming patch I want it to be at, but it didn&#39;t work. And also, I want that farming patch in Catherby to work too, along with the one I want to add.


[code]
		loadCustomSpawns(c);
		if (c.distanceToPoint(2813, 3463) &lt;= 60) {
			c.getFarming().updateHerbPatch();
		}

<p>Then you should see something like this</p>

<p>Change the coords of that ^ to the coords of your New tree patch and after when you plant a seed it should show up in in the same patch.</p>

<p>[ul][li]Make sure player is within x tiles of patch (an area of coords)[/li]<br>
[li]If object is in those area of coords, then send the config for just the one?[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Not sure if that would work… you do seem to have quite a predicament. Check and see how woodcutting does it, because that would be the same principle.</p>
