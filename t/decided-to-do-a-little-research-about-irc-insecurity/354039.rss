    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/decided-to-do-a-little-research-about-irc-insecurity/354039</link>
    <description>so this is basically a statement of apology to those whom i blamed for the botnets i have been receiving from AMERIKA through the insecure IRC channels on the moparscape site. I cam across this article that helped me understand more about this.
[code]Many IRC servers also include service users. These service users are essentially robots
which provide services to users. These service bots are usually named in a fashion that makes
them easy to recognize such as Chanserv, Nickserv, Memoserv, etc. One common service is that
of a Channel bot. Chanserv (most commonly used name) can help maintain channels even while
no users are currently in that channel. Each implementation of a channel bot differs; therefore,
features present on the bot may differ from network to network.
Since information is relayed in IRC, this type of communication is not secure. There are
many possible ways for attackers to probe for information and initiate attacks. Trojans, viruses,
and backdoors are some of the malicious tools that hackers on IRC use to compromise
computers. [/code]
so to moparisthebest, sorry about all that spam about the irc botnets i received through my own stupidity.

idc what anyone thinks of this post, if you already know about this then good for you.

Sample Script
[code]/checkchan {
if ($me ison %adchan &amp;&amp; %adcount &lt; 3) {
msg %adchan %temp
inc %adcount
echo -----------------------
echo Advertisement #: %adcount
echo -----------------------
if ($me ison %homechan) {
msg %homechan %temp
}
}
else {
echo •4 *****************************************************************
echo •4 35 seconds have not passed yet, Ignoring Command (Ban Protection)
echo •4 *****************************************************************
}
}
