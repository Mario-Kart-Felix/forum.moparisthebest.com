    <description>[b][size=24pt]About Restormel[/size]
[/b]Restormel is a server that came out of the idea of merging the Minecraft world with gameplay from various MMO&#39;s such as World of Warcraft, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Rift, and many more.
We, as admins, feel as if we have manifested this idea into Restormel, and created the ultimate Minecraft MMO experience.

[b]Server info:
[/b]
[b]Dungeons:[/b] Epic dungeons that you can complete either solo, in a group of 4, or even up to a raid group of 10.

[b]Classes:[/b] The lore of Restormel revolves around two warring nations competing for the throne in the capital of Restormel, which is held by a tyrant king, King Titus. Each nation is entitled to three unique classes each.

[b]Towns:[/b] Join a current town or create your own community. If you wish, you can put your town under the control of your governing nation, and join in on the PVP events.

[b]PvP:[/b] Every two months there is a nation war commenced, where Towns flying the banner of their nations compete for supremacy. It&#39;s either kill, or be killed. Towns independent of nations cannot compete in the nation war.

[b]Any Questions? Queries? Ask in the forum below!
[/b]
Currently, we estimate the server to have finished development by the 25th of April, 2012.

Additional information about development and how Restormel will work can be found on our website.
