          <blockquote>
              <p>When you ask a question, pretend we are seven-year-old kids (that’s very easy to do as most of you guys are) that have no idea what’s going on. That’s how much you’ll have to explain. When asking the question, you must clearly ask it, just like Silabsoft said. This means use proper grammer and spelling, as this makes our job easier, and make sure you’re question is understandable.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll have to show us what you’ve already done. THIS IS A MUST! If we want to get anywhere as a community, we’re going to have to quit the spoon-feeding. So if you ask something like “how do I get food healing to work” and show us no previous attempts, you’re not going to get an answer. You may be wondering how a question like this is considered bad. Well, the question asker did not make an attempt to solve the problem him or herself, and is indirectly asking the same question as “tell me how to get food healing work so I can continue my effortless server.” So, remember, show us what you’ve done, what you’ve tried to do, or what you think may work.</p>
<p>After you have all of that, you’ll have to identify the problem. Its not our job to add your snippet into our own servers and test it for any inconveniences, its YOURS. Usually, its a compilation problem, and it can be solved very easily by glancing at the JavaDocs. Something like NullPointerException can be found by typing NullPointerException java.sun in the Google search bar. This will return results with links to the JavaDocs about your problem.</p>
<p>Remember, this is just the bare minimum. Try and keep your questions as elaborate as possible. This will benefit yourself and the community as a whole, as you will be learning in the process and we will be able to help solve your problem faster.<br>
Use Google. Thanks for SilabSoft and Telenubby make this ppost. Also, playerhandler.java</p>
