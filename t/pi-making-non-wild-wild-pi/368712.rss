    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-making-non-wild-wild-pi/368712</link>
    <description>How do i make it where non wild is wild or pvp. I want to make a few places wild to pk where its 10wild.

Places:
Bandit camp
Al kaid
Ardy
Fally
Lumby
Yanille

I want to make those towns 10 wild so e.g if your a lvl 3 you can attack 3-13 and if your 126 you can attack 116-126 and if your 90 you can attack 80-100. So you get what i mean but servers have it pvp where says lvl it can attack i can probly do that but i mainly what the wild. So if somone can give me the boolean or code ect ill code the rest of it, or you can give me a link to a guide ty.</description>
