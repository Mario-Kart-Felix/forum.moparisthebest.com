    <description>I am currently on a 474 client. I get stuck when loading up the game at the &#39;Connecting to Update Server&#39; point. After a while the load up screen goes black, then the cmd gives me a &#39;error_game_js5connect&#39;. I know it probably has something to do with the IP I have set. So I have gone into the client.jar file and cannot seem to find anywhere to input the IP 127.0.0.1. I have used the Ctrl + F to try and find it also. I have coded / worked on 317 servers before. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just because it&#39;s 474 or what. Please help  :).
