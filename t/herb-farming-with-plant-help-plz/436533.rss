    <title>Herb farming with plant help plz</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/herb-farming-with-plant-help-plz/436533</link>
    <description>I have been working on farming for some time, and have added every other type of farming in the game, watering, growing, harvesting etc. Everything was going amazing until I hit the herb farming.
There is only one herb plant for all of the herbs, and despite any attempts, I cannot seem to make it give you the herb of the seed that you planted. would anyone be able to help me get passed this one thing in farming I cannot seem to get figured out?</description>

<p>Did that one already. Love doing things myself so I can learn more than just a copy paste. But either they have all ended up providing the herb for each plant set to the object ID. I am certain it is just a little thing that I am missing that will make everything click into play. I should be overly excited that all patches grow their respective plants by watering, raking the patches, and chopping down trees and fruit trees at the end of the process. But I am a perfectionist…which in websites and gaming can be a bad thing lol.</p>

<p>If so, just add a check to make sure it gives you the appropriate herb based on the seed used.</p>
</blockquote><br>
It will give one type, until I set another herb to it, then it will provide both of them. I have devised a method in which everything should work by a maens of reading a line of codes such as:<br>
{SeedID}<br>
{Herb}<br>
{Level}<br>
{Exp};<br>
But something just does not make it click…I will get it eventually I am sure lmfao. Could not figure out up/down stairs and ladders when I was opening everything, then it hit me like 3 weeks later when I was doing something completely different lmfao.
