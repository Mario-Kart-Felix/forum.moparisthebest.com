    <title>Eco Reset</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eco-reset/404369</link>
    <description>Economy Reset is an option for most server&#39;s but i think it&#39;s unfair if theres only like 5 items going around that are supposed to be rare; so i was wondering if anyone could build an eco reset that is built to only whipe certain items from the game for instance; Create a code that has it only delete &quot;####&quot;, &quot;####&quot;, &quot;####&quot;, (then you explain how to do it, and where the items go) This is due to some items on my server, and i&#39;m just wondering if anyone can help me with it. :D thanks - Jack -</description>
