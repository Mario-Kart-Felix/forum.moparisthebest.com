    <title>SCAR With Linux</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/scar-with-linux/135764</link>
    <description>Hey everyone  :)
I recently switched to linux, due to windows being a nubby nub  :o

I succsessfully installed SCAR Divi 3.11 on ubuntu, using WINE windows emulator, however i cannot run any scripts because includes cannot save.
Is there anyway around this? It seems there is virtually no includes even after installing them.

If this can&#39;t be done, then can someone give me a auto typer that is not made with visual basic (WINE can run it if it is made in delphi or something.)

The only thing i need working is a auto typer, so if anybody can give me a SIMPLE script without big includes that&#39;d be great  ;)
Don&#39;t care if someone says it won&#39;t function well, i just need to auto type because i have carpal tunnel


Thanks,
Heaven


P.S:Just got 2.03 and it works with srl, but it&#39;s only version 3.7, still looknig for help with divi.
BIGGER PROBLEMS:The cross hair only works with the scar window.</description>

              <p>This will be hard. The basic problem is i updated from windows xp to windows vista, then a few months later too all the gay crashes, I decided to get ubuntu. From my own knowledge, and my friends knowledge, using the BIOS i could boot from cd and install windows back whenever i needed it ( i was tired of winsucks except for .exe’s. )  I should try using cegeda, but i’m not sure if it’s worth it. When i boot the upgrade from BIOS, it says i must be on windows already to do a update, which at that time i was being a silly willy so i forgot about, so I decided to go download ultimate vista. Currently i’ve downloaded 2 vistas, which don’t work with my dvd discs, and won’t even fit on a mister audio cd. The dvd’s are 4.7gb, vista is 2.4gb, so it would work, but for whatever reason my dvd’s don’t work, so this is why i need scar for a bit. My mom won’t buy me more discs, and she doesn’t use this computer she only uses computers for work, but nowadays she just gets her work done at work because our printer broke. So i either have to live with this for a year or so, or spend a few days downloading random movies and putting them all on disc. Cegeda, or cedega whatever it’s called, looks alot better then wine, but i doubt it’d work. Visual basic programs don’t run at all using WINE - Delphi programs run, but do not function. I’m not doing this because i’m a sadistic person who cannot type normally, it’s just i have carpal tunnel. How would you like for your wrist to pop in and out every time you typed? Yeah i thought so. I knew this will be hard to help me with, but there is professional linux users here, atleast i think quite a few of you use linux. Linux can be a annoying bitch sometimes though, if you install something, sometimes it doesn’t run or it’s much more confusing. Especially after sticking around windows since windows 95 or so.</p>
<p>Sorry for the semi-off topic post. Just telling people the situation.</p>

From what I’ve heard its just a Windows emulator, that allows you to run Windows programs while on Linux.  Hopefully it allows you to use SCAR.[/quote]</p>

Use Windows.<br>
Or are you telling me you completely removed Windows?<br>
If so, then use a VM or something… or just reinstall it.</p>
