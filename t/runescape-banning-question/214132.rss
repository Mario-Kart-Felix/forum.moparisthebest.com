<p>Jagex have never mentioned IP banning and there have never been any report of people becoming IP banned. If however this were to happen, usually dependant on your ISP you can change your IP address simply by unplugging and then plugging in your router/modem.</p>

<p>people have been ip banned… I recall one on <a href="http://sythe.org" rel="nofollow noopener">sythe.org</a>. -  someone posted a picture or something of jagex saying he was ip banned.<br>

Durial321 was IP banned also.</p>
<p>I doubt it though, i think jagex would let you have another chance at playing right… that is, unless you have been caught with multiple accounts.[/quote]</p>
<p>he was not ip banned. There was no reason to ip ban him. He accidently found a glitch and abused it. His account was banned. Unless you can prove he was ip banned.</p>
