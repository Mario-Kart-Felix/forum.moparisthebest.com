    <title>Client Is Not Connecting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-is-not-connecting/334047</link>
    <description>The server was working fine 1 hour ago, Now the client wont connect.
I am using a router, With speed boost from cablevision.
The wifi is working fine and internet is working fine.
I have no idea why client is not connecting to the server.
____________________________________________________________

My IPv4 Changed from 4 to 3 thats why.
I had to change it in my router cPanel.</description>
