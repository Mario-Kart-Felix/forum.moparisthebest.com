    <description>hi guys,

              now before we start posting i must remind you -

[center]you are posting these jokes / images at your own free will and in any cases of chuck norris attacks i am in no way responsible. A roundhouse kick to the head has been known to be fatal from gods i mean chuck&#39;s foot so please be aware

Chuck doesn&#39;t know about us yet but im sure his godly hearing will detect you typing about him, its only a matter of time :eek: [/center] 

I&#39;m also thinking of making a page to his dedication...thoughts?

lets begin with my favorites :)

Chuck Norris doesn&#39;t read books. He stares them down until he gets the information he wants. 

Chuck Norris only masturbates to pictures of Chuck Norris. 

Chuck Norris appeared in the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; video game, but was removed by Beta Testers because every button caused him to do a roundhouse kick. When asked bout this &quot;glitch,&quot; Norris replied, &quot;That&#39;s no glitch.&quot; 

Filming on location for Walker: Texas Ranger, Chuck Norris brought a stillborn baby lamb back to life by giving it a prolonged beard rub. Shortly after the farm animal sprang back to life and a crowd had gathered, Chuck Norris roundhouse kicked the animal, breaking its neck, to remind the crew once more that Chuck giveth, and the good Chuck, he taketh away. 

please post yours :)

              <p>hi guys,</p>
<pre><code>          now before we start posting i must remind you -
</code></pre>
<p>[center]you are posting these jokes / images at your own free will and in any cases of chuck norris attacks i am in no way responsible. A roundhouse kick to the head has been known to be fatal from gods i mean chuck’s foot so please be aware</p>
<p>Chuck doesn’t know about us yet but im sure his godly hearing will detect you typing about him, its only a matter of time :eek: [/center]</p>
<p>I’m also thinking of making a page to his dedication…thoughts?</p>
<p>lets begin with my favorites <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Chuck Norris doesn’t read books. He stares them down until he gets the information he wants.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris only masturbates to pictures of Chuck Norris.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris appeared in the “Street Fighter II” video game, but was removed by Beta Testers because every button caused him to do a roundhouse kick. When asked bout this “glitch,” Norris replied, “That’s no glitch.”</p>
<p>Filming on location for Walker: Texas Ranger, Chuck Norris brought a stillborn baby lamb back to life by giving it a prolonged beard rub. Shortly after the farm animal sprang back to life and a crowd had gathered, Chuck Norris roundhouse kicked the animal, breaking its neck, to remind the crew once more that Chuck giveth, and the good Chuck, he taketh away.</p>
<p>please post yours <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
