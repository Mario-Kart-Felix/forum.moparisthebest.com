    <title>Rune Rebirth - Small Team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rune-rebirth-small-team/386736</link>
    <description>[u][b]Intro[/b][/u]

Well, I&#39;m getting kind of lonely developing and testing alone; so I am looking for about [b]two[/b] people to help me test and/or develop.
I think that with more people I could go much further than my expectations.
If you would really like to see the development, it can be found [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,479737.0.html]here[/url].
I mainly made this development topic due to people asking me to test.


[u][b]Requirements[/b][/u]

[ul][li]You must be familiar with Java[/li]
[li]You must have some knowledge of the Rs2 Protocol[/li]
[li]You must be trustworthy[/li]
[li]You must be active[/li][/ul]



[u][b]Application[/b][/u]

Now that we have all that out of the way, here is the application format.

[u]Info[/u]

Name IRL:
Age IRL:
About You:

[u]The Team[/u]

Why would you like to join Rune Rebirth?
Are you applying for Tester or Developer?
Why are you applying for this position?
Do you have any proof of your knowledge of Java and the Rs2 Protocol?

[u]Misc[/u]

Any other info can go here.


[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]

To be honest, I&#39;m starting to feel like the only reason that I am continuing this development is because of Rash. This is mainly because I&#39;m lonely developing it, and it gets boring at times :(.
Please fill out this application and save Rune Rebirth &lt;3</description>

              <p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Intro</span></span></p>
<p>Well, I’m getting kind of lonely developing and testing alone; so I am looking for about <span class="bbcode-b">two</span> people to help me test and/or develop.<br>
I think that with more people I could go much further than my expectations.<br>
If you would really like to see the development, it can be found <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,479737.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.<br>
I mainly made this development topic due to people asking me to test.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Requirements</span></span></p>
<p>[ul][li]You must be familiar with Java[/li]<br>
[li]You must have some knowledge of the Rs2 Protocol[/li]<br>
[li]You must be trustworthy[/li]<br>
[li]You must be active[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Application</span></span></p>
<p>Now that we have all that out of the way, here is the application format.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Info</span></p>
<p>Name IRL:<br>
Age IRL:<br>
About You:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">The Team</span></p>
<p>Why would you like to join Rune Rebirth?<br>
Are you applying for Tester or Developer?<br>
Why are you applying for this position?<br>
Do you have any proof of your knowledge of Java and the Rs2 Protocol?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Misc</span></p>
<p>Any other info can go here.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Conclusion</span></span></p>
<p>To be honest, I’m starting to feel like the only reason that I am continuing this development is because of Rash. This is mainly because I’m lonely developing it, and it gets boring at times :(.<br>
Please fill out this application and save Rune Rebirth &lt;3</p>
