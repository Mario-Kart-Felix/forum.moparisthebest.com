        <p>I wonder why anyone would even bother going to the effort of digging for info about people on the internet?</p>
<p>They are doing their jobs by telling cheats and other villains where to get off. Of course it’s very easy to<br>
do that in the relm of Cyberspace, since you don’t actually have to face your foe. Would you start on an off duty copper just because they banged you up for drunk and disorderly the night before?</p>
<p>Of course you wouldn’t. So why have a go at Jagex mods. They have a job to do and do it. Some of you broke the rules by cheating, so pay the price.</p>
<p>Cheaters, plaguerists, divers, Christiano Ronaldo, all deserve a straight red.</p>
<p>To be honest, its all rather underhand and cowardly. Sneaking around spying on good people who have jobs to do. I dispare i really do…</p>
<p>Thou cad, thou cur, thou fiend, thou bounder, thy presence is an afront. Thou art as low as a slug! XP</p>
<p>(why a slug? I dunno, i was just thinking of some strange and random invertebrate to compare people who indulge in think kind of thing to.)</p>
<p>Some of you cheat; thats fine. Just don’t complain when you get the boot, and certainly not go around winding them up afterwards, thats oh so chav and yob tactics. I bet some of you were sat in class one day got detentention and then went and and put wet paint in their teachers coat pockets, or egged their cars. Thats basicaly what it amounts to.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>It’s one person getting this info, no one else…[/quote]</p>
<p>Whatever, whatever. Who cares who’s getting it, thats not the point. It came from here plus there must be some demand for it or else the guy wouldn’t post it. ^_~</p>
<p>Those who enjoy that sort of thing are as bad as those who go looking for it in the first place.</p>
<p>Would any of you like them to go dig up some details about you and post it on a public message board?</p>
<p>Those in favour of having their privacy infringed upon say aye. As far as i am concerned its just as wrong to post peoples private email or instant messenger details as it is a phone number. I dare say even that may be covered at some point by legislation. One can only hope so. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eyec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>

        <p>The Black Phoenix, they are viewing our forums, some say it’s spying but others think logically. The following post is purely written on what I’ve read, it is NOT 100% accurate so sorry for any mistakes.</p>
<p>Vipsta hasn’t released his sources yet, so I’m going to presume Vipsta has stumbled upon this info anywhere on the WWW. So, if they where to put there info on the WWW, and Vipsta discoverd it, and simply pasted it somewhere else, that wouldn’t be spying would it? Because if it is spying, then that means JAGeX are spying on us to some extent.</p>
<p>If however Vipsta knows these people personally, then isn’t this a mere conversation between friends? Definition provided by The American HeritageÂ® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Copyright Â© 2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. “4. Society as a whole; the public.”. So this makes us the general public, it also says a few definitions up somthing along the lines of “A group of people sharing the same thing”, so generally we’re a small percent of the public that likes Mopar or SCAR, now the public make friends, so if we make friends of each other, we aren’t spying on these people.</p>
<p>You mention “Some of you cheat; thats fine. Just don’t complain when you get the boot, and certainly not go around winding them up afterwards, thats oh so chav and yob tactics.”. Now, I really don’t want to get too personal here but I despise chavs. (Commentary: Right, now I’m talking to myself, cool. (h) Well anyway, here normally I’ll say somthing like “you need to relise” and blame it on you, but please, read on) I personally find RuneScape a hard game, I’ve wasted alot of my life on runescape, I’ve missed school because I’m playing this game. To cheat in runescape I sleep at nights and go to school in the mornings. Being steriotyped as a cheater that just leeches then when I am banned complain about it is annoying.</p>
<p>I congratulate you if you’ve read all of my whining, as this post comes to an end, I’ve got one last sentence left. Before you insult us, take a look at why we might be doing it.  Also, if it DOSE get a little ANNOYING, why can’t you just ask Vipsta to stop? After all, isn’t fighting each other childish?</p>
<p>EDIT: To make paragraph 3 a little more clear, if Vipsta knows person 1, then he tells his friends on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> about it, that would make it a chat between friends, right?<br>

<p>Do you know what?</p>
<p>One of my favourite things is playing a game, completing it, and then ripping it appart and making it my own. Or cheating and having some fun after the challenge is over.</p>
<p>Now with an ordinery RPG, this is perfectly ok. But i believe runescape is somewhat different, being that it’s a game people join up and pay to play. Now cheating there will be cheating everyone that plays it. Because of the interaction with other people; real people.</p>
<p>Now would you subscribe to something which you know contains players which cheat?</p>
<p>I have spent many a year wasting time playing games. But if you enjoy it then it’s time well spent; but not if you have cheaters robbing you of your enjoyment. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Now, as far as i am concerened cheating real people is wrong, its your problem for being so wrapped up in an imaginery world. But i can’t call the kettle black, i have loved games to the point of being so wrapped up with them myself, and i have cheated at games, and found ways to cheat even supposedly uncheatable games. But none of them ever involved cheating real people, or paying customers!</p>
<p>Thats the issue.</p>
<p>Why the hell should anyone pay to play something thats unfair?</p>
<p>As for the rest, i am unaware of anyone connected with LW, or Weez here. All i know is that LW doesn’t like people posting stuff about her of any nature on public forums, unless you’re plugging her art. So it might be nice if people respect that fact. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Thats all i am getting at.</p>

<p>Now with an ordinery RPG, this is perfectly ok. But i believe runescape is somewhat different, being that it’s a game people join up and pay to play. Now cheating there will be cheating everyone that plays it. Because of the interaction with other people; real people.</p>
<p>Now would you subscribe to something which you know contains players which cheat?</p>
<p>I have spent many a year wasting time playing games. But if you enjoy it then it’s time well spent; but not if you have cheaters robbing you of your enjoyment. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Now, as far as i am concerened cheating real people is wrong, its your problem for being so wrapped up in an imaginery world. But i can’t call the kettle black, i have loved games to the point of being so wrapped up with them myself, and i have cheated at games, and found ways to cheat even supposedly uncheatable games. But none of them ever involved cheating real people, or paying customers!</p>
<p>Thats the issue.</p>
<p>Why the hell should anyone pay to play something thats unfair?</p>
<p>As for the rest, i am unaware of anyone connected with LW, or Weez here. All i know is that LW doesn’t like people posting stuff about her of any nature on public forums, unless you’re plugging her art. So it might be nice if people respect that fact. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Thats all i am getting at.</p>

        <p>Yes, but there’s a fine line between raping cheats and not. If I cheat at remote places that no one would ever work at, and never sell anything, basically secluded from the rest of people in runescape, it benifits me, the only downside to that is unfair advantage, yet my only unfair advantage is levels gained. But, here’s where it gets confusing, even though I’m affecting no one else in runescape, I’m still treated as someone who steals all the coal rocks in the mining guild.</p>
<p>Technically yes, I have contact with othet people, levels gained, I rarely doubt any cheat or macro can get 99 in every skill without being caught, but at the end of the day, there’s so many abusers I’ve stopped playing.</p>
<p>“Now, as far as i am concerened cheating real people is wrong, its your problem for being so wrapped up in an imaginery world.” I found that offensive. One mistyped sentence and I get treated as an addict.</p>
<p>I’ll get to the point because it’s late, runescape is massive. I completed resident evil 4 in a mere 8 hours(spread over 4 days) and do each round now in 3~ hours, overall it’s taken me about 40 hours gameplay to complete it with all unlockables, I speant 80 hours on pokemon leaf green and still haven’t completed it fully. Now, I’ve played runescape legitly for almost a year and a half and I’m only at 95 combat with 1340~ total level. Dosen’t that prove somthing?</p>
<p>Because runescape is massive, getting the most enjoyment out of the game is doing the things you like, for me that’s castle wars, ahrims, whip and a few ice bursts, I’m only 2m off? Lets alch 10k yew longbows just for that 2m! 10k Alchs and a sore finger later, I spend 2 hours in cw’s having fun. Oh noes, I’m out of spells. Time to go back to alching… Now, wouldn’t it be so much more fun if you had a little longer? Alot of stuff in runescape is fun for hours because of people. The only thing is it takes hours of work to get a little enjoyment.</p>
<p>For anyone who cares: I have symptons of asperger’s syndrone but have never been diagnosed with it. I have never in my life had a normal sleeping pattern. That’s why I find “Now, as far as i am concerened cheating real people is wrong, its your problem for being so wrapped up in an imaginery world.” offensive. If I don’t sleep and it’s 1 am and I’m awake like I’m hyper, what am I suppost to do? Be bored for 8 hours, be tired out my mind for 7 hours, be not tired and bored for another 16 hours then sleep for 14 hours?</p>
<p>Yes, I could go out, but then there’s nothing to do. I could exersize, but where? I could play with friends? But they live far away.</p>

<p>Wow, someone on the internet paid attention to you, YOU MUST BE POPULAR AND LIEK HAVE FREINDZ MYSPACE LIVEJOURNAL BLOG PODCAST … Gah, there is enough bullshit in that sentence to make me want to eat a cat. On a side note, how random are you if you have a blog with any form of personal information ? Hell, even with someone’s cat name and ip, you can suddenly become unrandom.</p>
<p>But seriously, what are you doing here anyway ? Do you have any interesting in programming leaning towards modifying the rs client ? Server dev maybe ? Maybe you’re just some kiddie who broke out the grammar and punctuation checker trying to grab some attention. Maybe you should seek attention elsewhere, somewhere where people won’t go crazy because you referred to yourself as a ‘she’.</p>
<blockquote>Also, seriously what the hell is wrong with you people, all I get is MSN messages from you trying to add me...seriously like...thats creepy.</blockquote>
A pink blog (crap, I said it again, must ... resist ... urge to club ... baby seal .... ) is creepy. Birds of a feather ...
<blockquote>Actualy it must be nice to have crazy people research you on the internet...its like being famous and adored by creepy boys on the internet.</blockquote>
Ahh, so that's the reason for the pink eh ?

Okay, once again Weez isnt a Jmod, just a friend of one. Though I doubt she considers having a forum post evaluated “pwned” (sees above reply) ahh see I am right! <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyc164.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Also, seriously what the hell is wrong with you people, all I get is MSN messages from you trying to add me…seriously like…thats creepy.<br>
I’m not going to add you so just dont bother, it saves us BOTH a lot of time!</p>
<p>Actualy it must be nice to have crazy people research you on the internet…its like being famous and adored by creepy boys on the internet.</p>
<p>Actually wait…is that a good thing?</p>
<p>The mind boggles :S<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Ahh, I never thought JMods could be so dam annoying. My bad thinking Weez isn’t a Jmod. Meh, everyone makes a mistake, no one is perfect. Also, yes, Weez WAS completely “Pwnd” by eXampler (Sp?).</p>
<p>Also, I don’t think you have a right to say [quote]What the hell is wrong with you…[/quote].</p>
<p>Put yourself in our fine cheating shoes. Our arch rival is the JMod. It was you who banned my account legitimatly unfairly. I was banned for autoing, yet our number one rule is never auto with your main. I have no idea how you got to banning my account. To be honest, I never really used Aryan to a great extent. Back on-topic, yes, our fine shiny shoes. I myself find it rather intriguing adding a JMod. Who knows what would happen. Also, you can hardly call it creepy? We were given an MSN address of a person who works on one of the biggest MMORPG in the world. In fact, I would be honoured to talk to you. I hardly call it creepy.</p>
<p>As for saving us both a lot of time, it really doesn’t. It takes me rougly 3 seconds to Copy and Paste. Then another 5-10 adding you. What do you have to do? Press two buttons and carry on with your life…It hardly takes a lot does it.</p>

<p>[quote]Creepy[/quote] Such a bad word used for such a good reason. I hardly call what one person is doing creepy. What I do find creepy is that you post information like that all over the internet for people you don’t even know to have facts about your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We aren’t all boys here. I know you may not know the difference quiet yet being sat in front of a computer screen all day, but there is such a thing as porn.</p>

<p>It isn’t a good thing from your point of view. It is from ours. Hey, I may aswell take what I can get…</p>
