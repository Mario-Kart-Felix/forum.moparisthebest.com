<p>Weez and NoobyMcNoob: The information is there and available on these forums, and there’s really nothing you can do about it. You’ve probably already figured this out for yourself, but arguing about this won’t really get anywhere. Although, I agree with you that Vipsta is an idiot and shouldn’t have posted information about Jagex mods, and I think Weez is a good friend for posting on behalf of Laura W. There’s just no point to Vipsta’s actions. But you have to admit that if he found that information legally, he can post it wherever the hell he wants. I don’t agree with this, and I even tried to email Laura W and Mark O warning them about Vipsta and his “secret information,” and they obviously ignored it. Well, I’ve lost respect for them, now. I have to say that they’re perfect representatives of Jagex, though. I don’t cheat, and I never will, but I’m making a macroing program in hopes that I’ll finish it and be able to release it to many cheating communities. I’m doing it because I dislike Jagex, and it’s a great way to learn about programming and create a program people will probably utilize. I haven’t always disliked Jagex, though; this is a pretty recent step for me. I used to adore Jagex, and I wished to become a player moderator. I wanted to become part of the moderator team because it’d make me feel as though I were a part of something big, and it’d make me feel as though Jagex wanted my help. But that’s not true, and that’s never been true. I know, like many others, I’ve tried to help Jagex and they’ve ignored me. This isn’t a pity speech or anything; I’m just telling you why Jagex sucks as a customer support team, and why the staff members I’ve tried communicating with seem to be the same way.</p>

</aside>
<p>I intend for this to be my final post on your lovely forums, don’t get me wrong Im all up for putting my points across but I have a lot to do this month and the internet is such an easy distraction. So i thought I would just respond to this wonderful, inteligent and well thought our response with my own disagreements and agreements.</p>
<p>Firstly, your right I do understand that this information is on the web, I dont really have a problem with people finding it as long as they do not use it maliciously. As for Vipstas information, I can assure you people ARE aware of despite a few peoples emails, we dont accept emails or MSN conversations with players because if we did it for one person, we couldnt be fair to everybody else. Im only posting on this forum because I can do so in a light hearted manner and defend a friend who is sticking up for Jmods.</p>
<p>I’m sorry that you never got to a Player Moderator. I think that your problems with Jagex are a bit unjustified however. We cannot be your best buddies or do everything, they are still a company at the end of a day. Oh and by the way this isnt me speaking as a Jmod, this is me as an individual. My profesional opinion is reserved for Jagex Messages.</p>
<p>I do strongly advise you not to release cheating software, make it and learn by all means but it will just result in a lot of problems for people, you know that, I know that. Thats just some friendly advice, no hints, no threats, just some simple internet stranger advice.</p>
<p>Now I apologise for my “cheeky” posts where I may of been a bit of sarcastic grump, I hope you all continue to play Runescape fairly and do not cheat/macro, but I know that wont happen 100%.</p>
<p>I wont be adding people to my MSN and I do appreciate the gesture, however I simply cant, I dont want to take any risks.</p>
<p>I hope you will understand.</p>
<p>Thats my final thought.</p>
<p>Take care chaps and chapeses.</p>

Okay, once again Weez isnt a Jmod, just a friend of one. Though I doubt she considers having a forum post evaluated “pwned” (sees above reply) ahh see I am right! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Also, seriously what the hell is wrong with you people, all I get is MSN messages from you trying to add me…seriously like…thats creepy.<br>
I’m not going to add you so just dont bother, it saves us BOTH a lot of time!</p>
<p>Actualy it must be nice to have crazy people research you on the internet…its like being famous and adored by creepy boys on the internet.</p>
<p>Actually wait…is that a good thing?</p>
<p>The mind boggles :S<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Ahh, I never thought JMods could be so dam annoying. My bad thinking Weez isn’t a Jmod. Meh, everyone makes a mistake, no one is perfect. Also, yes, Weez WAS completely “Pwnd” by eXampler (Sp?).</p>
<p>Also, I don’t think you have a right to say [quote]What the hell is wrong with you…[/quote].</p>
<p>Put yourself in our fine cheating shoes. Our arch rival is the JMod. It was you who banned my account legitimatly unfairly. I was banned for autoing, yet our number one rule is never auto with your main. I have no idea how you got to banning my account. To be honest, I never really used Aryan to a great extent. Back on-topic, yes, our fine shiny shoes. I myself find it rather intriguing adding a JMod. Who knows what would happen. Also, you can hardly call it creepy? We were given an MSN address of a person who works on one of the biggest MMORPG in the world. In fact, I would be honoured to talk to you. I hardly call it creepy.</p>
<p>As for saving us both a lot of time, it really doesn’t. It takes me rougly 3 seconds to Copy and Paste. Then another 5-10 adding you. What do you have to do? Press two buttons and carry on with your life…It hardly takes a lot does it.</p>
<p>[quote]Actualy it must be nice to have crazy people research you on the internet…its like being famous and adored by creepy boys on the internet.</p>
<p>Actually wait…is that a good thing?[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is one person getting this information. To be honest, I could live without it but It wont harm me so I may aswell use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[quote]Creepy[/quote] Such a bad word used for such a good reason. I hardly call what one person is doing creepy. What I do find creepy is that you post information like that all over the internet for people you don’t even know to have facts about your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We aren’t all boys here. I know you may not know the difference quiet yet being sat in front of a computer screen all day, but there is such a thing as porn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It isn’t a good thing from your point of view. It is from ours. Hey, I may aswell take what I can get…</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Next time you decide to suttaly insult a group of people, remember that a community is made up of people who share eachother common interests. We will stick up for eachother.</p>
<p>Kthxbye [/quote]</p>
<p>Mr.Chris, nobody was pwnd/t. I have no clue who the hell you stole kthxbye from, and creepy is a good word. Vipsta, anyone could do the same to you.<br>
I could do the same to you.</p>

<p>Wow, someone on the internet paid attention to you, YOU MUST BE POPULAR AND LIEK HAVE FREINDZ MYSPACE LIVEJOURNAL BLOG PODCAST … Gah, there is enough bullshit in that sentence to make me want to eat a cat. On a side note, how random are you if you have a blog with any form of personal information ? Hell, even with someone’s cat name and ip, you can suddenly become unrandom.</p>
<p>But seriously, what are you doing here anyway ? Do you have any interesting in programming leaning towards modifying the rs client ? Server dev maybe ? Maybe you’re just some kiddie who broke out the grammar and punctuation checker trying to grab some attention. Maybe you should seek attention elsewhere, somewhere where people won’t go crazy because you referred to yourself as a ‘she’.</p>

A pink blog (crap, I said it again, must ... resist ... urge to club ... baby seal .... ) is creepy. Birds of a feather ...

Ahh, so that's the reason for the pink eh ?

              <p>Yes, but there’s a fine line between raping cheats and not. If I cheat at remote places that no one would ever work at, and never sell anything, basically secluded from the rest of people in runescape, it benifits me, the only downside to that is unfair advantage, yet my only unfair advantage is levels gained. But, here’s where it gets confusing, even though I’m affecting no one else in runescape, I’m still treated as someone who steals all the coal rocks in the mining guild.</p>
<p>Technically yes, I have contact with othet people, levels gained, I rarely doubt any cheat or macro can get 99 in every skill without being caught, but at the end of the day, there’s so many abusers I’ve stopped playing.</p>
<p>“Now, as far as i am concerened cheating real people is wrong, its your problem for being so wrapped up in an imaginery world.” I found that offensive. One mistyped sentence and I get treated as an addict.</p>
<p>I’ll get to the point because it’s late, runescape is massive. I completed resident evil 4 in a mere 8 hours(spread over 4 days) and do each round now in 3~ hours, overall it’s taken me about 40 hours gameplay to complete it with all unlockables, I speant 80 hours on pokemon leaf green and still haven’t completed it fully. Now, I’ve played runescape legitly for almost a year and a half and I’m only at 95 combat with 1340~ total level. Dosen’t that prove somthing?</p>
<p>Because runescape is massive, getting the most enjoyment out of the game is doing the things you like, for me that’s castle wars, ahrims, whip and a few ice bursts, I’m only 2m off? Lets alch 10k yew longbows just for that 2m! 10k Alchs and a sore finger later, I spend 2 hours in cw’s having fun. Oh noes, I’m out of spells. Time to go back to alching… Now, wouldn’t it be so much more fun if you had a little longer? Alot of stuff in runescape is fun for hours because of people. The only thing is it takes hours of work to get a little enjoyment.</p>
<p>For anyone who cares: I have symptons of asperger’s syndrone but have never been diagnosed with it. I have never in my life had a normal sleeping pattern. That’s why I find “Now, as far as i am concerened cheating real people is wrong, its your problem for being so wrapped up in an imaginery world.” offensive. If I don’t sleep and it’s 1 am and I’m awake like I’m hyper, what am I suppost to do? Be bored for 8 hours, be tired out my mind for 7 hours, be not tired and bored for another 16 hours then sleep for 14 hours?</p>
<p>Yes, I could go out, but then there’s nothing to do. I could exersize, but where? I could play with friends? But they live far away.</p>

<p>Do you know what?</p>
<p>One of my favourite things is playing a game, completing it, and then ripping it appart and making it my own. Or cheating and having some fun after the challenge is over.</p>
<p>Now with an ordinery RPG, this is perfectly ok. But i believe runescape is somewhat different, being that it’s a game people join up and pay to play. Now cheating there will be cheating everyone that plays it. Because of the interaction with other people; real people.</p>
<p>Now would you subscribe to something which you know contains players which cheat?</p>
<p>I have spent many a year wasting time playing games. But if you enjoy it then it’s time well spent; but not if you have cheaters robbing you of your enjoyment. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Now, as far as i am concerened cheating real people is wrong, its your problem for being so wrapped up in an imaginery world. But i can’t call the kettle black, i have loved games to the point of being so wrapped up with them myself, and i have cheated at games, and found ways to cheat even supposedly uncheatable games. But none of them ever involved cheating real people, or paying customers!</p>
<p>Thats the issue.</p>
<p>Why the hell should anyone pay to play something thats unfair?</p>
<p>As for the rest, i am unaware of anyone connected with LW, or Weez here. All i know is that LW doesn’t like people posting stuff about her of any nature on public forums, unless you’re plugging her art. So it might be nice if people respect that fact. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

But if you enjoy it then it’s time well spent; but not if you have cheaters robbing you of your enjoyment. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Now, as far as i am concerened cheating real people is wrong, its your problem for being so wrapped up in an imaginery world. But i can’t call the kettle black, i have loved games to the point of being so wrapped up with them myself, and i have cheated at games, and found ways to cheat even supposedly uncheatable games. But none of them ever involved cheating real people, or paying customers!</p>
<p>Thats the issue.</p>
<p>Why the hell should anyone pay to play something thats unfair?</p>
<p>As for the rest, i am unaware of anyone connected with LW, or Weez here. All i know is that LW doesn’t like people posting stuff about her of any nature on public forums, unless you’re plugging her art. So it might be nice if people respect that fact. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Thats all i am getting at.</p>
<p>My replies will always be civilized. ^_~<br>

<p>Vipsta hasn’t released his sources yet, so I’m going to presume Vipsta has stumbled upon this info anywhere on the WWW. So, if they where to put there info on the WWW, and Vipsta discoverd it, and simply pasted it somewhere else, that wouldn’t be spying would it? Because if it is spying, then that means JAGeX are spying on us to some extent.</p>

So this makes us the general public, it also says a few definitions up somthing along the lines of “A group of people sharing the same thing”, so generally we’re a small percent of the public that likes Mopar or SCAR, now the public make friends, so if we make friends of each other, we aren’t spying on these people.</p>
<p>You mention “Some of you cheat; thats fine. Just don’t complain when you get the boot, and certainly not go around winding them up afterwards, thats oh so chav and yob tactics.”. Now, I really don’t want to get too personal here but I despise chavs. (Commentary: Right, now I’m talking to myself, cool. (h) Well anyway, here normally I’ll say somthing like “you need to relise” and blame it on you, but please, read on) I personally find RuneScape a hard game, I’ve wasted alot of my life on runescape, I’ve missed school because I’m playing this game. To cheat in runescape I sleep at nights and go to school in the mornings. Being steriotyped as a cheater that just leeches then when I am banned complain about it is annoying.</p>
<p>I congratulate you if you’ve read all of my whining, as this post comes to an end, I’ve got one last sentence left. Before you insult us, take a look at why we might be doing it.  Also, if it DOSE get a little ANNOYING, why can’t you just ask Vipsta to stop? After all, isn’t fighting each other childish?</p>
<p>EDIT: To make paragraph 3 a little more clear, if Vipsta knows person 1, then he tells his friends on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> about it, that would make it a chat between friends, right?<br>
EDIT2: I’m intrested to see your reply to this, The Black Phoenix.[/quote]</p>
<p>Do you know what?</p>
<p>One of my favourite things is playing a game, completing it, and then ripping it appart and making it my own. Or cheating and having some fun after the challenge is over.</p>
<p>Now with an ordinery RPG, this is perfectly ok. But i believe runescape is somewhat different, being that it’s a game people join up and pay to play. Now cheating there will be cheating everyone that plays it. Because of the interaction with other people; real people.</p>
<p>Now would you subscribe to something which you know contains players which cheat?</p>

<p>Whatever, whatever. Who cares who’s getting it, thats not the point. It came from here plus there must be some demand for it or else the guy wouldn’t post it. ^_~</p>
<p>Those who enjoy that sort of thing are as bad as those who go looking for it in the first place.</p>
<p>Would any of you like them to go dig up some details about you and post it on a public message board?</p>
<p>Those in favour of having their privacy infringed upon say aye. As far as i am concerned its just as wrong to post peoples private email or instant messenger details as it is a phone number. I dare say even that may be covered at some point by legislation.
