    <title>A problem with this webpage caused Internet Explorer to close and reopen the tab</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-problem-with-this-webpage-caused-internet-explorer-to-close-and-reopen-the-tab/407510</link>
    <description>There was an earlier discussion of this but no one ever had an answer and so I thought I&#39;d open a new discussion.

This did not used to happen, and it does not happen on my other computer, however, whenever I go to www.moparisthebest.com (the home page) IE 9 reports the following:

&quot;A problem with this webpage caused Internet Explorer to close and reopen the tab.&quot; And I&#39;m staring at a blank screen.

When I do the same in Firefox--just go to www.moparisthebest.com -- Firefox promptly quits, closing ALL tabs (no matter how many I have open) in the process, without even an error message.

I have the latest Java. I have the latest updates on IE9 and the latest version of Firefox. They&#39;re BOTH doing it. I&#39;m on Windows 7 Ultimate.

I&#39;ve tried clearing the browser caches, that doesn&#39;t do anything. Does anyone else know what might cause something like this?</description>

That’s because it has to run Java, but you do not need it downloaded to use it…  I didn’t have Java download for a year, and I could play tons of webclients with no problems.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not sure how that would work.  Runescape itself requires Java, and it’s only a webclient, plus webclients are Jars from my knowledge.</p>
