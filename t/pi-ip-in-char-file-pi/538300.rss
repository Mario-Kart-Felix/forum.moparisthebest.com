That is the variable in the Player class that holds the players IP address. 

Since you've shown no prior attempts at trying to get this to work, I'm not going to help you any further. This is the Server [b]HELP[/b] section, not the Server "Give me all the code I want" section. Also, adding a variable to the save file in Project Insanity is extremely simple, but it wouldn't surprise me if you haven't even looked in the PlayerSave class yet. I suggest you read this post: https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,331370.0.html and this one: https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,267609.0.html</code></pre>
