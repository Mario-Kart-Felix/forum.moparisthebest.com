    <description>Does anyone know how to get rid of this thing...


I&#39;m using a popular 508 as a base for my server, but I cannot get rid of the guys website and name, that is on the actual playing window....  I know people make these as an Anti-Leech, but it&#39;s kinda annoying when your advertising your site on a base server, that other people plan to use.


For those of you, who do not kno what I&#39;m talking about, it&#39;s David&#39;s Davidscape source.





Thanks,
