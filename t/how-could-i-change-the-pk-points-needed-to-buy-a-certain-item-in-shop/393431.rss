              <p>[quote=“pildurass, post:4, topic:393431”]Go into character files. Find your character and scroll down a bit in your files or jst hit ctrl+f and search “pk” there should be something called pkpoints.<br>
Example: Player pkpoints = 0<br>
to get max do this:: Player pkpoints = 999999<br>
hope this solves your problem =][/quote]<br>
One thats stupid, thats changing his player pk points. And back to topic go to ShopAssist.java and then find the case <em>your item id</em> it will be in a list with other id’s at the end you will see “return <em>how much it is</em>;” just change the how much. heres an example for if you wanna do just one item</p>
<p>Befor:</p>
<p><code>Case 15667
Case 15668
Return 50;</code><br>
After:</p>
<p><code>Case 15667
Return 25;
Case 15668
Return 50;</code></p>
<p>Also make sure your not cutting anything off… for example<br>
Befor:<code>Case 15667
Case 15668
Case 15669
Return 82;</code><br>
After:<code>Case 15667
Case 15668 &lt;--- Your cutting the one on top off and it will be 50.
return 50;
Case 15669
return 80;</code></p>
<p>Also if you wanna just make it faster instead of cutting all them off<br>
Befor:<code>Case 15667
Case 15668
Case 15669
Case 15670
Return 92;</code></p>
<p>After:<code>Case 15667
Case 15668 &lt;--- now your making the above case 15667 worth 50.
return 50;
Case 15669  &lt;---here is were you cut the top off
return 25;
Case 15670
return 52;</code></p>
