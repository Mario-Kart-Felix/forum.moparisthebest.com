    <title>.. got a prob here.... mopar client problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/got-a-prob-here-mopar-client-problem/18901</link>
    <description>mmkay...

just got a new comp have java and everything installed
i went to run the moparscape client and the download times out
so i say.. whatever it would do that anyway since i&#39;m on dialup
so i copied and pasted the cache from a different computer thru a flash drive.
no problems, this is how i got it to the other computer and the other computer works fine on mopar
so i copied the cache into my windows file and it doesnt see it
i think its because im running windows 2000 so the main windows file is WINNT when its looking for WINDOWS
so i made another folder called WINDOWS and i copied the cache into there.
still doesnt work. i can go into dos and do c:/cd windows c:windows/cd .mpr_file_store_32 and it opens the cache folder but when moparscape looks for it, it doesnt see it
i might need mopar on this one.. 
also the 2 computers that do run the clients are WINME and WIN2000- the windows 2000 version has to run off of the web client though

help PLEEEZ!  :(</description>
