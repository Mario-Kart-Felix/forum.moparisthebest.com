    <description>Well I&#39;ve done plenty of work on it and it&#39;s finally ready for beta. I present to you ~ MyScape.

Has fully working ancients.
Fully working Castle Wars.
Rares are actually rare so you can&#39;t get easily.
Many ways to get money.
Working fight caves.
Full range.
Full weapon emotes.
Full character design.
Many NPCs.
Many realistic things.
Full mining, smelthing, WCing, cooking, and fishing.
And a lot more.

Unfortunately, I&#39;m only letting certain people on. Atm it&#39;s hamachi-based for non-lag reasons. [b]ALL testers will get admin rights.[/b] 

This isn&#39;t a job to play around in - it&#39;s to play the game and find any serious errors. You&#39;ll tell me them all and I&#39;ll write them down.

Here&#39;s the application -
