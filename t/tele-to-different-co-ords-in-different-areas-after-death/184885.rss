    <title>Tele to Different Co-ords In Different Areas After Death</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tele-to-different-co-ords-in-different-areas-after-death/184885</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;m using a devolution 7.0 server source and i would like all help, examples, tutorials, advice on how to make it so if you die in a certain area you get teleported to a certain place instead of yanille (falador in my case). 

Eg.
Ok when you die you go to yanille co ords no matter where you die. When i die in castle wars i still go to yanille i want to go to the waiting area. So lets say, errrr, the yanille co ords were 1111 1111 and castle wars were 9999 9999 if i search for 1111 ( yanille) and change to 9999 ( castlewars) where ever i die i will always go to castlewars if i did that so if i died in wildy id go to castle wars and i dont want that i only want you to go to castlewars if you die and your in the castle wars vicinity.

All help is appreciated.

Thanx!

Also even the layout of the piece of code would be great as i&#39;m not experiences with area co-ords.</description>
