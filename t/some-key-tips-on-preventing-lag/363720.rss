    <description>[i]This is an introduction tutorial to show some beginner users what they can do to prevent lag, and also what causes it so they&#39;ll know how to fix it. This tutorial will also help those speed up Gameplay, along with creating a faster client.[/i]

[b]Chapters: 1-9[/b]
[b]Author:[/b] [u]QuestMaster 2K10[/u]


[b]Chapter: [i]1[/b]

When creating a RuneScape Private-Server, you will soon relise that other players are finding your server to be laggy. Sometimes you may not even notice it, or it just don&#39;t happen when you&#39;re logged in. [b]Why?[/b] Well, for other players, they have to connect to your server through straight transmission, which means, they connect straight from their local telephone tower all the way to yours. There could be an interference in the tower that could only effect them with lag, but not other players. The reason why you probably won&#39;t lag so much is because you don&#39;t have to connect from telephone tower to tower, since it&#39;s on your computer. 

[b]Chapter: [i]2[/b]

[i]Important:[/i] Also, when using a Processing system in your server, don&#39;t add or create useless junk that don&#39;t need to be there. This will cause that process to take longer to process requests because it has so many other requests to check aswell. A process system should be called every 600 milliseconds, and should only be used for timers or for such purposes. Things like an Action Button, or an Option Packet should not be handled there but elsewere.

[b]Chapter: [i]3[/b]

Don&#39;t have too many other windows open on your computer other than the Runtime of your server and maybe a few clients. But other Internet Explorers that are open may slow down the java that&#39;s on your computer, and then may not be able to fully process requested code on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and may slow down server performance. This is very important.

[b]Chapter: [i]4[/b]

When adding content updates, try using a different computer to create and develop updates while you use the other for actually running the server. Some of the main reasons why server laggs so much, or why players unexpectedly crash is because when you compile your server, it uses alot of RAM (Random Access Memory) that&#39;s on your computer so the JDK can process the request. This will lag the Runtime depending on your computer, until the compile is complete.

[b]Chapter: [i]5[/b]

Try creating and developing your own class, that can be used for automating the server. Code it to restart the server every 45-60 minutes, and declare the actually file somewhere like the Engine. This could help, by refreshing the JVM refreshing the RAM.

[b]Chapter: [i]6[/b]

Try buying a Dedicated, or a VPS for your server. This will keep your server online, 99.99% of a whole month. They specially host the servers on a custom computer that is built with lots of RAM, which is good for server development and for atracting players.

[b]Chapter: [i]7[/b]

For a faster client, don&#39;t add too much useless code. Don&#39;t add customs, that will majorly slow down a client. Don&#39;t add custom music to the client. Don&#39;t add custom code to any file in the cache. And make sure you are using a clean cache that can be read by the client.

[b]Chapter: [i]8[/b]

I would recommend using Windows XP or higher when using a computer for development. Other operating systems can be used too, but PC is the best and easiest way to work with java.

[b]Chapter: [i]9[/b]

Make sure all incomming packets and bytes that are being recieved to your server by the client are clean are properly coded to the right source. If they or not this could cause server crash or lag.



[i]This should help with some lag problems have. It&#39;s not the best, and the chapters are short. But in the future, i&#39;ll be looking forward to updating this thread with more information. Post ideas in what you think would help lag performance.[/i]</description>
