    <description>[If this does not belong here please move or delete!]
Hey people so I am creating a Game Development Software called n-Gen! I am making it in GML (ya thats right), and I say it is outstanding. n-Gen can currently compile to Html5, Linux, PC, Mac, Android, and soon to come IOS. With that said here is a screenie of n-Gen and the Coding is a new language im building with n-Gen that is like c# just some differences.

<p>Yes, but there are some modifications to each that can cause problems. For example, I was working in a Computer Integration Lab (fancy term for we put computers and servers together, and ship them) and the customer ordered 2 server blades. All of the hardware was the same, except one used 2 i386 processors, and the other had i686 processors. When we burned the hard drive/BIOS images and all that jazz, the i386 board didn’t work. Turns out that the BIOS image required some i686-only instructions, and rendered the i386 board useless.</p>

<p>Lol, I was actually modeling it after GML and C#, but you can put it your way two :p. I think I may make it simpler though…<br>

<p>Alright, and do you have some proof? How are you interpretting the language? How are you compiling the languages? Do you have support for different architectures? (ie. Linux can be put on i386, i486, i686, amd64, x86_64, Macs on PowerPC and intel-based, SPARC processors, and ARM processors are gaining popularity).</p>
<p>Frankly, I call bullshit[/quote]<br>
Later when I am home from school I will post an Html5 game I have made with this, and hopefully that will show you that I am actually making this work…</p>
