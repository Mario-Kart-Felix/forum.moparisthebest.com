    <title>Need help with &quot;Realism 614&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-realism-614/429094</link>
    <description>Hello people,

I have downloaded the client and source from this page: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,512733.0.html
and everything runs fine and such, but whenever I run the client, it goes to the login screen (which is good ofc.) but when I try to login, it keeps saying error connecting to server. I have changed the IP to 127.0.0.1 in 3 different files (all i could find) but it still doesnt seem to let me connect to the server... Also, there is no compiler in the files, do i need one to make these changes &quot;work&quot; ? If yes then please tell me how to get one, I would really appreciate that.

I would really love to play this server so if you know how to fix this issue, please let me know!

Also, this is my first time posting in the MoparScape forums so if I do something wrong, please correct me.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Anyone?</description>
