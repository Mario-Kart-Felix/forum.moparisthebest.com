    <title>Is this bull shit, or just me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-this-bull-shit-or-just-me/369210</link>
    <description>Ok, so my cousin is graduating this year from high school.

Her dad is indian.

When she graduates, the government gives the tribe, to give her (because of her dad being indian) 60,000 dollars, and pay for her college, JUST BECAUSE WE TOOK THEIR FUCKING LAND 200 SOME YEARS AGO? What the fuck? Our nation is shitty enough and in debt enough to have some mooching fat ass indians crying that we took their shit so long ago.

Anyone else agree?</description>

these arent me, just some other various posters, look around and youll findem, unless they read this and deleted what they posted.
OT:
<blockquote>Exactly if a white person was granted 60 Grand there wouldent even be a thread for this it would probably just be mentioned in some random persons off topic post the sad thing is that the goverment is still GIVING away free cash imo the american goverment is already in too deep and dosent need to give away 60 Grand when it could be used to purches wepons for on going wars ect witch is probably the reason why america is in the hole in the first place because they give away to much stuff</blockquote>
and sorry but.. war is what messed up our country in the first place, why not spend it on useful things, like public school?

<p>Exactly if a white person was granted 60 Grand there wouldent even be a thread for this it would probably just be mentioned in some random persons off topic post the sad thing is that the goverment is still GIVING away free cash imo the american goverment is already in too deep and dosent need to give away 60 Grand when it could be used to purches wepons for on going wars ect witch is probably the reason why america is in the hole in the first place because they give away to much stuff</p>

My first 2 and a half years of high school I had just-passing grades. Does this mean I do not deserve the governments grand for my college? I think so, as I am going in for something I love to do. You are being a very ignorant person to think that most black americans are racist. It is the skin-heads like you that give us white people a bad rep. If we stopped complaining about shit, and just accepted what we are given (aka, when you are handed lemons, make lemonaid), there would be no issues. I personally, in the very racist state, Mississippi, had a mix of black and white friends. How you ask? Because we showed respect for eachother, even if we had our differences, we showed respect. Respect for your follow man is how wars are won. Not letting him get shot because hes a different color of skin.</p>

…<span class="bbcode-b"> to have some mooching fat ass indians crying that we took their shit so long ago.</span></p>
<p>Anyone else agree?<br>
[/quote]That is why they get money, they’re still discriminated against.<br>
[/quote]i discriminate anyone who isn’t white, or has a religion other than christian/atheist. i HATE niggers.<br>
[/quote]Why.<br>
[/quote]its just being raised differently. i was raised around mexicans, and than lived in the same small apartment as a black family who did hit me when they baby sat me sometimes. i now have a special hatred for them. its just me.<br>
[/quote]Oh, so due to perhaps a .00001 percentile of the population of blacks and mexicans having a slightly negative impact on your life personally determines your views on their race as a whole?[/quote]i lived around them my whole life, all of them except for a small percent were as racist towards me than, as i am to them now. i just recently left the 2 areas i lived in that i lived around them. like i said, its just the way i was raised. i’ve met decent mexicans before, wish i could say the same about blacks.</p>
<p>btw. theres a 37.4% chance that the statistic you gave me was made up.</p>
<p>@ m.dog… yea we both have soooo much to lie about. and no, and i guarantee your “girlfriend” is ugly as fuck than.</p>
<p>and also…</p>
<p>your an ugly red headed weird looking, goofy looking fuck with no friends who acts smart/tough over the internet.</p>

<p>excuse me those indians aren’t alive still.</p>

<p>Excuse me, you’re still retarded.  You obviously didn’t read the rest of what I was saying, which was that they don’t receive free college, except for one college in Colorado (iirc), and that is because the college gives them a free education, not the government.</p>

[/quote]the info came straight from my aunt. this was also 200 some years ago, so these indians, are not effected.</p>
<p>btw m.dog your a nerdy fuck, that will never get a girlfriend, go kill yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Then your aunt is bullshitting out her ass.  And why resort to useless, retarded comments?  Because you know that you’re completely wrong?  And how are these indians not affected?  Don’t you think there lives have completely changed because they we’re pushed out of the areas they once lived?  Please, think through things before you post them.  Both of you are just making yourselves look retarded.<br>
[/quote]the indians alive today are just as capable as the rest of us of making a decent life. and yes, they do give free college. im just stating what my aunt said.</p>
<p>btw m.dog you’re an ugly nerdy ginger headed fag that will never get a girlfriend.[/quote]<br>
Like I said, either your aunt is bullshitting out her ass, or you are to cover yours.  And btw, I have a girlfriend.  What is that, 2 things I’ve proved you wrong on in this thread?  So sit back, shut the fuck up, and jam it up your ass.</p>
<p>[quote=“Javafire, post:45, topic:369210”]so the indians deserve better treatment than the ones who found america and gave it a population. That sounds like racism to me. Rasism torwards white people can be possible, just look at certain gangs, they hate us “whities”.</p>
<p>I’m Jewish/German can i get money for being a walking contradiction?[/quote]<br>
I don’t see how America was ever really found, when there have been people here (the Native Americans) since the ice age.  I also don’t want to hear you complain about racism towards whites, as all you have done in this thread is be pigheaded and racist towards Native Americans.</p>
