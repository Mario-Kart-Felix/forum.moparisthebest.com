    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-need-some-programming-done/523773</link>
    <description>Hey guys. I need some programming done on my server. I&#39;ll post a list containing content I want added, and bugs I need fixed. If you see something you want to tackle, just tell me. I don&#39;t care how you get it done, as long as it&#39;s done well and won&#39;t break later-on.

Before I get any flame, yes I realize that a lot of these would be easy to fix with just a few tutorials, but I don&#39;t have the time or patience to learn.

I&#39;m working on Project Insanity.

 Here&#39;s the list of Bugs I want fixed, and Content I want added:
[code]
Woodcutting:
Needs a complete overhaul. Sometimes woodcutting will work, and sometimes it won&#39;t. It&#39;s really buggy.
[/code]
[code]
Firemaking:
You start the firelighting animation, but you don&#39;t actually light a fire. You do walk back and get experience though.
A bonfire system would be a lot nicer than the current one.
[/code]
[code]
Fletching: 
You can only fletch one of something at a time. None of the Make 5, or Make X buttons work. Animations are really buggy too. I&#39;d like to get this completely rewritten as well.
[/code]
[code]
Smithing:
Smithing doesn&#39;t work past smelting. You can only smelt, and even it&#39;s glitchy. A complete remake of smithing would be nice.
[/code]
[code]
Crafting:
When chiseling gems, you have to use the chisel on each and every gem. I want a screen where I can just click make X instead of the current system.
Leather crafting needs work too.
Also, once you finish crafting the gem into a cut gem, there&#39;s nothing you can do with it except fletch them.
[/code]
[code]
Newer Items:
Some of the newer items don&#39;t equip. I&#39;d like someone to go through and figure out which items don&#39;t equip, and to fix them accordingly.
[/code]
[code]
Herbs:
Strangely, when you clean a grimy herb, it cleans fine, but the model it uses is the 317 version of it. I&#39;d like the new models to be used.
[/code]
[code]
Agility:
The agility animations when crossing the obstacle course are too fast.
Experience is huge at the end of the lap, but non-existant throughout the course. I&#39;d like it to give decent experience the whole course, and just an added bonus at the end.
Right now there&#39;s only the Gnome Agility course. I&#39;d like another. Possibly the wilderness course.
[/code]
[code]
Object Type Messages:
When regular users click on objects, they get messages that say the object type and the number following it. I&#39;d like that to be for developers/owners only.
[/code]
[code]
Runecrafting:
Right now there&#39;s no way to get to the altars to actually craft the runes. I was thinking about using talismans as teleports to the altars.
I need pouches added, as well as a difference between rune essence and pure essence. Rune essence should only work for the runes it does in RS.
[/code]
[code]
Skills Tab:
Sometimes the Smithing skill displays as 1/1 even when it&#39;s maxed out. 
I&#39;d like for Dungeoneering and Summoning to be added to the skills tab. A tab that looks like this would be good: http://i.imgur.com/YiWvy9K.png
Total level isn&#39;t right. and the combat level needs to be adjusted to 138 instead of 126.
[/code]
[code]
Quests:
I&#39;d like a working Quest system for the quest tab. A starter quest or two would be nice as well.
[/code]
[code]
Achievements: 
I want an achievement system for the achievement tab. 
[/code]
[code]
Summoning: 
I want to completely gut the current summoning system and have it customized the way I like. So, it needs a complete overhaul.
[/code]
[code]
Dungeoneering:
I want to remove any previous dungeoneering content added and customize my own dungeoneering system. 
[/code]
[code]
Fishing:
Fishing needs a complete rework.
All of the fishing system is buggy.
[/code]
[code]
Cooking:
Cooking animations need to be fixed and all cookable items (within reason) need to be added.
[/code]
[code]
Auras:
I want to add working Auras to the server.
They don&#39;t need to have any visual effects, but they do need to give bonuses, and have timers.
[/code]
[code]
Equipment Tab:
I want to add a slot for auras.
I also want to add a new button (inbetween the armor stats and items on death button) for donators.
[/code]
[code]
Bosses:
Alot of my bosses on this server are just NPCs with incredible high HP and can melee really hard. I&#39;d like to get some bosses that actually require strategy. 
Some bosses should switch attack styles based on the prayer being used.
Nex needs to be added. I&#39;ve got the NPC and animations, but nothing else.
[/code]
[code]
Iron and Steel Dragons:
I guess the models got overwritten or corrupt because now they&#39;re both invisible. I&#39;d love to have this fixed.
[/code]
[code]
Dragonfire:
Dragonfire barely does any damage what-so-ever.
[/code]
[code]
Warrior&#39;s Guild:
I need the warrior&#39;s guild added. NPC&#39;s / Doors / Stairs don&#39;t work. Also there are white walls in guild.
[/code]</description>
