    <description>How do I save variables on Project Czar?

I tried it a second ago... It didn&#39;t have any errors, but it didn&#39;t save what it was supposed to save either.

Somebody please just tell me where to put some code and what to put for the variable to save.

If you want to be really nice and write a little snippet of code that I can C &amp; P, here is the variable name: 
massCountTotal

Thanks in advance,
