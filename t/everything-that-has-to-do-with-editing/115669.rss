    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/everything-that-has-to-do-with-editing/115669</link>
    <description>Sorry if im a noob, im trying to make my own private server and im having some trouble. First of all, i cant cast magic spells. And how do you set the HP of a NPC. Also, how do you edit shops?
Is there any other codes i should know?
Also, auto item and npc spawning?

thanks in advance,

<p>And if you want to get an item specifically (all servers should have this command) type ::pickup then hit space and type in the item ID you want then hit space again and type in the quantity you want.</p>

              <p>Awesome. I can show you how to do that… one second.<br>
Ok here it is.<br>
1)Open up client.java-<br>
2)search for if(command<br>
3)I’m sure your source has some commands already out, so you should see some there. Go to the end of one<br>
(you’ll see a } and then on the next line it’ll start off another if(command. Press enter after the })<br>
4)<br>
Ok, copy and paste this <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><code>else if (command.startsWith("what you want them to type to get the item"))

<p>This should work. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Oh, and for the part that you put in what you want them to type, dont add the :: For example, if you want them to get an anti, you would just type in anti. Then, they would have to type ::anti to get an anti poisen potion!

              <p>Alright, well…shops.cfg opens up all your shops. For the items, each item has it’s own little id number. Your source may only be able to use certain codes, so see if there is a file named Item List.txt in your source files. If not, go onto Moparscape (the regular thing) and click help&gt;item ids. Then you can search for the items you want. Now, back to the shops. Look for the shop you want to edit. The first 2 numbers you can ignore. Then, it’ll go item id, amount, item id, amount. It’s very simple. If you want to add one, go to the end of the long thing, tab, and put in the id, tab and amount. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>You can’t cast magic spells because it’s not coded. It’s not like Runescape you know, it will take years to code the whole of Runescape. To set the HP of an NPC, go to npc.cfg and change the last number of that npc line. You edit shops by going to shop.cfg. Those numbers after the shop IDs are the item IDs and quantities. You spawn npcs in autospawn.cfg. read the top line of that cfg and you’ll know what to do. Item spawning is in drops.cfg - same thing read the top line and you’ll know what to do.</p>
