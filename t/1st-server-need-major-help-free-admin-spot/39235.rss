<p>How To Make Your Own Server<br>
By Moose Sabre aka Skys Shadow</p>
<p>Step 1:<br>
Well to make a server you need a source. A source is basically the backbone of your server.<br>
There are many good sources out there. Some famous ones are Cheezscape, Testscape, Whitescape,and Megascape.I would recommend any of these. You can also get moosescape (my source) from <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/4588724/Moosescape_Source.rar" rel="nofollow noopener">http://rapidshare.com/files/4588724/Moosescape_Source.rar</a><br>
If you want any of the previously named sources, go to <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,37555.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,37555.0.html</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong><strong>NOTE</strong></strong></em> Moust sources are .rar files. To extract these, you need winrar. Get winrar from <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm</a> and click on the link that says english.</p>
<p>Step 2:<br>
Now once you download a source (make sure it is on your desktop for easy access) open up the file. Make sure that there is a client.java (lol). If there isn’t…well you have a really really bad source. Now right click compile.bat and click edit. Leave that file minimized and open up My Computer. Go to your C drive (local disk) and click on program files. Then click on java. See what the highest numbers (make sure it is the last two numbers)on a jdk and a jre folder are. It sould be 05, 06, 07, 08, or 09. If it isn’t, then download the latest java at <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a>. Download the JDK version 5 update 9.</p>
<p>Step 3:<br>
If the last two numbers are 05 then replace whatever is in the compile.bat file with–</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@echo</a> off<br>
<span class="mention">@color</span> 1f<br>
title Server compiler<br>
echo Starting YOURSERVERscape<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_05\bin\javac.exe” -cp . *.java<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_05\bin\java.exe” server<br>
pause</p>
<p>For 06 make it–<br>
Code:</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@echo</a> off<br>
<span class="mention">@color</span> 1f<br>
title Server compiler<br>
echo Starting YOURSERVERscape<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_06\bin\javac.exe” -cp . *.java<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_06\bin\java.exe” server<br>
pause</p>
<p>For 07 make it–<br>
Code:</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@echo</a> off<br>
<span class="mention">@color</span> 1f<br>
title Server compiler<br>
echo Starting YOURSERVERscape<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_07\bin\javac.exe” -cp . *.java<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_07\bin\java.exe” server<br>
pause</p>
<p>For 08 make it–<br>
Code:</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@echo</a> off<br>
<span class="mention">@color</span> 1f<br>
title Server compiler<br>
echo Starting YOURSERVERscape<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_08\bin\javac.exe” -cp . *.java<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_08\bin\java.exe” server<br>
pause</p>
<p>And for 09 make it–<br>
Code:</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@echo</a> off<br>
<span class="mention">@color</span> 1f<br>
title Server compiler<br>
echo Starting YOURSERVERscape<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_09\bin\javac.exe” -cp . *.java<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_09\bin\java.exe” server<br>
pause</p>
<p>Step 4:<br>
Now save and exit out of that. Double click compile.bat and a black box should come up.<br>
If you did the following correctly it should look something like this.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t then redownload source as you have done something wrong. If it still doesn’t work then post here and I’ll do my best at answering your questions.</p>
<p>Step:5<br>
Now you need to make yourself an admin. So open up client.java and hit control+f. Search for moderaters. You should get<br>
Code:</p>
<p>//start of moderator/admin list, 1 = mod, 2 = staff, 3 = admin</p>
<p>. If you don’t, keep searching until you do OR if it never shows up then go into the Data folder and type your name in adminstrators.txt.<br>
When you find it, add this code on the line below.<br>
Code:</p>
<p>if (playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(“YOURNAME”))<br>
{<br>
playerRights = 3;<br>
}</p>
<p>Step 6:<br>
Now save and exit. Double click compile.bat. Open up moparscape and make sure your server ip is 127.0.0.1 Login with the name that you put in the previous code. Say anything that you want. If a gold crown appears next to your name, Good for you. If it doesn’t then go into client.java and search for<br>
Code:</p>
<p>if(playerId == -1) out.write(7);</p>
<p>You should see this–<br>
Code:</p>
<pre><code>		if(playerId == -1) out.write(7);		// "This world is full."
		else out.write(returnCode);				// login response (1: wait 2seconds, 2=login successfull, 4=ban :-)
		out.write(playerRights);		// mod level
		out.write(0);					// no log
</code></pre>
<p>replace that  with<br>
Code:</p>
<pre><code>		if (playerId == -1) out.write(7);		// "This world is full."
		else out.write(returnCode);				// login response (1: wait 2seconds, 2=login successfull, 4=ban :-)
		if (playerRights == 3)
		{
			out.write(2);      //Crown fixup
		}
		else
		{
			out.write(playerRights);		// mod level
		}

		out.write(0);					// no log

	}
</code></pre>
<p>Now save and exit. Exit out of the compiler also and then restart it and login with the same name.Say anything again and you should see a gold crown next to your name. If you don’t, then don’t worry about it for now because everyone else can see your crown anyways. And if you really care about it then on the code with YOURNAME change the 3 to a 2.</p>
<p>Step 7:<br>
You now need to decide whether your server is going to be hamachi or no-ip. For hamachi, do the following–</p>
<p>Step 7a: Hamachi Setup<br>
Now we need to setup hamachi. Go to <a href="http://hamachi.cc/download" rel="nofollow noopener">http://hamachi.cc/download</a> and download hamachi. Once it’s downloaded, open it up. Click on the button on the bottom second from the right and click on create network. Make the network name<br>
the name of your server and the network pass the name of your server minus the scape. So if your server is examplescape make the network name Examplescape and the pass example. You can add more networks if they get full just put a number after Examplescape but make them all the same password for easy access…</p>
<p>Now look at the top of hamachi. It should have 4 numbers seperated by periods and the first one should be a 5. Under it should be annonymous. To change your name, click the button on the bottom right and click preferences. Click change nickname to modify your name. Now look at the ip (the number that starts with a 5). Memorize that number because it is the number that you have to tell people to connect to your server from.</p>
<p>Step 7b: No-ip setup<br>
GO TO <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,38770.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,38770.0.html</a> FIRST!!! THANKS LOTHY!!<br>
To setup no-ip go to <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> and sign up for an account. You will recieve an email from no-ip to confirm your account registration. Activate your account through that email. Go back to the no-ip site and click Downloads at the top. Download the no-ip duc (which is the only download there) for the system you have. Then, at the top  (still on the website), click on YOUR NO-IP. On the sidebar on the left, click Hosts/redirects and click add. Make the hostname your servername (no caps) and leave the rest of the settings alone. Click create host.<br>
If you have the no-ip duc up right now exit out of it then open it up again. You should see your hostname there (examplescape.no-ip.info). Click the box next to the name so that it is checked and the smily face should start to blush. If it blushes, then you have done this step correctly.</p>
<p>Step 8:<br>
To run your server so that people can connect to it–<br>
If you are using hamachi, have hamachi up and the power running. Go into your server source files and click runserver.bat. This will start your server so that others can connect to it.<br>
If you are using no-ip, make sure the smily is blushing and click runserver.bat. This will start your server so that people can get on it.</p>
<p>Step 9:<br>
Now its time to Advertise! Get on your favorite private server site and make a post for your server. Be sure to include the servername, hamachi network name, hamachi network password, ip, or no-ip hostname.<br>
Post some features about your server and maybe even make a website for it.</p>
<p>Step 10: Extras<br>
I will add some extra things here that you can put in your server. Just remember that the best way to put cool things in is to search in the tutorials section. If you want to know how to do something fairly simple (not like add skills or change graphics) then ask here.</p>
<p>If you want to make npcs say if you are offline then do this</p>
<p>search for–<br>
Code:</p>
<p>if (PlayerHandler.isPlayerOn("</p>
<p>Add this if you don’t have it–<br>
Code:</p>
<p>}<br>
if (npcs[i].npcType == 2253) {<br>
if (misc.random2(25) &lt;= 3) {<br>
npcs[i].updateRequired = true;<br>
npcs[i].textUpdateRequired = true;<br>
if (PlayerHandler.isPlayerOn(“YOURNAME”)){<br>
npcs[i].textUpdate = “YOURNAME IS ONLINE!”;<br>
}<br>
else{<br>
npcs[i].textUpdate = “YOURNAME IS OFFLINE”;<br>
}</p>
<p>Then go into autospawn.cfg. Add this at the bottom–<br>
Code:</p>
<p>spawn = 2253	3243	3429	0	3243	3429	3243	3429	2</p>
<p>So the whole thing looks like–<br>
Code:</p>
<p>spawn = 2253    3243    3429    0    3243    3429    3243    3429    2</p>
<p>[ENDOFSPAWNLIST]</p>
<p>Adding Spawning Commands:<br>
To add a command search for a spawning command (not pickup!) that you know exists in your server. My example will be phats. When you search for phats you should come up with a code that looks like this–<br>
Code:</p>
<pre><code>	else if (command.startsWith("phats") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1)
	{
		addItem(1039, 10000);
		addItem(1041, 10000);
		addItem(1043, 10000);
		addItem(1045, 10000);
		addItem(1047, 10000);
		addItem(1049, 10000);
	}
</code></pre>
<p>Now let me explain. The “phats” is the command name. Change that to whatever you want the command to be. The player rights is the rights for the people who are able to use it. If you want everyone to be able to use it, put a 0 there, for mods/admins/owners, put a 1, for admins/owners, put a 2, and for owners, put a 3. Now for the items. If you look at the 2 numbers after the addItem, the first number is the item ID (which can be found in your moparscape folder). If the item that you want to spawn has a 3 digit id (such as 0995) don’t put the 0 in the code (so it would be 995,100000). The number after the comma is the amount of the item to spawn. So this command will spawn 10k of each phat. REMEMBER–If the item ID is not a noted item, it will only spawn 1 item.<br>
Some Clarification (appearantly needed): If you want to add a command just copy a command (such as phats) and paste it under the } for that command</p>
