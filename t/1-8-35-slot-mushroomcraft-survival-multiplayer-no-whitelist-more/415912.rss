    <description>Hello there!
Mushroomcraft is a 24/7 survival multiplayer server looking for friendly players.
We have a 35 slot (Will be upgrading very soon!) server with many of the best plugins.

[size=24pt][b]173.234.41.235:25567[/b][/size]

While we like to have fun, there are obviously going to be some simple rules to follow, these are:
-No greifing.
-No looting out chests. [We have Lockette for protection!]
-No abuse or racism. (We like to have a laugh but don&#39;t take it too far!)

Our current plugins include:
-Lockette (use signs to lock doors and chests ect.)

-Iconomy (simple in game money system. Can buy / sell and trade!)

-Jobs (a way to earn money by either digging, mining, farming, hunting or even make your own jobs)

-Homes can be set by using a bed! (When you die, you will re-spawn in that bed.)

-Log tool (A tool used by admins to check the history of blocks which makes finding griefers and getting them banned much easier and accurate!)

-World Guard (A tool used to prevent any grief in an area)

-IconomyShops (You can create your very own shop by simply placing a chest with a sign above it, you can alter prices and the stacks of the item easily!)

-Factions (A great add-on that lets the players create their own faction and fight/ally against or with other factions for land and power!)

-NoCheat (Stops cheaters / hackers)

-VoxelPort and Stargate portals! (Makes transportation between towns much quicker)

-Many more plugins that have been added!


We hope you enjoy the server, leave a comment for a request or feedback or even if you&#39;re just generally interested in joining!

Thank you! Have fun!
