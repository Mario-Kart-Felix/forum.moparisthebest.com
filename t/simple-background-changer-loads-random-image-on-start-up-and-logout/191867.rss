    <title>Simple background changer - Loads random image on start-up and logout</title>

    <description>[b]Purpose:[/b] So you can set a few images for the client to use. I used this for my server, i let people submit backgrounds in a competition, and just quickly made this to use more than one.
[b]Difficulty:[/b] 1
[b]File edited:[/b] Class30_sub2_sub1_sub1

First add this small method;

[code]
	public static int random(int range) {
		return (int) (java.lang.Math.random() * (range + 1));
	}[/code]

For example i will use this;

[code]int Back =[/code]

Decide on how many images you are going to use, i chose to use 4. So my integer would look like this;

[code]int Back = random(3);[/code]

Now you need to make it load, we are using an integer which can store a whole number value. So if i was setting it out to load from my files i would use;

[code] Image image = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage((&quot;NAMEOFBACK&quot;+Back+&quot;.EXTENSION&quot;));[/code]

That means that any image called;

NAMEOFBACK0 - 3 will be called randomly.

To use it from the internet its simple and most clients already have it, but ill post anyway;

[code]Image image = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage(new URL(&quot;http://YOURSITE/NAMEOFBACK&quot;+Back+&quot;.EXTENSION&quot;));[/code]

And import;

[code]import java.net.URL;[/code]

That allows the client to connect to the internet using that java package.

And your done, if you want to test it first you can also add this under your background load.

[code]System.out.println(&quot;Loading image &quot;+Back);[/code]


There is proberly a much more simple way of adding this using a String; but i just used this for now.</description>
