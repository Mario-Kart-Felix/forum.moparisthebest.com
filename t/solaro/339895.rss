    <title>Solaro</title>

    <description>I saw an ad on Facebook about it and got intrigued (while bored), so I decided to register and I checked out the shop.
&lt;blockquote&gt;SOLARO™ is used to supplement what you’re learning at school. You use it at home to improve your marks, stay on top of studies and get ahead. With SOLARO™ you can set goals for which you will receive rewards when you achieve them. You can use SOLARO™ as a reference while you do homework and projects and use the quizzes and tests to check how well you know the content you’re learning. When you use the site regularly, you will develop study habits and strategies that will make it easier to master the subjects you’re learning at school.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stars are incentives to help keep you motivated and are something you are rewarded with when you’ve worked hard or reached a goal. Stars are used in SOLARO™ as a virtual currency to buy rewards. When you have a certain number of stars earned (which I yet have to figure out), real rewards can be given. So I looked at the real shop and it was fucking amazing for such a site.

The top rewards were an XBox 360, a laptop, a PSP and a Wii. And other shits like DVD players and headsets for a smaller amount of stars. Unfortunately these rewards wont be given out while the site is in beta. It actually looks pretty good.
