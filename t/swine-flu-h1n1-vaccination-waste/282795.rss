    <title>Swine Flu(H1N1) Vaccination = Waste?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/swine-flu-h1n1-vaccination-waste/282795</link>
    <description>Well, the U.S. just wasted another 190$ million in my opinion. They put money into researching a swine flu vaccination, when it&#39;s really no worse than the regular flu..

Waste or helpful?</description>

<p>Actually statistics show it is a bit worse.<br>
The werid thing about the swine flu is that it’s affecting young, fairly healthy people, and staying away from the older people.</p>

Stay on-topic, this is about swine flu, not you having to search up every word in the dictionary to understand what we talk about, and they were right when they said you’re a moron. Swine flu wouldn’t kill them or anything, and they won’t get it just because you’re mad.</p>
<p>Yeah, that’s a waste/ <span class="bbcode-b">WASTE</span>.</p>

I Actually had Swine flu last week. Diagnosed by a doctor… Most people have it mild and is like a cold. IE: Cough, Headache, sore throat, Aching. Which is how i had it.</p>
<p>Its really not that bad. I just took 2 painkillers when i woke up everymorning so i only felt shit for about 40 minutes… At least im immune from it now until it mutates lol.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>And you will have alot more resistance to the mutated form than people who haven’t had it. I kinda want it, so I can run around crowded areas sneezing on people.[/quote]</p>
<p>i got it of my mate who had it alot worse then me. His face went grey and his lips swelled up lol… Ended up in hospital for it.</p>

<p>True, however what if it doesn’t spread all that much more?  There’s the possibility of anything, and at this stage, without allowing the disease to settle for a few months, they could’ve very well spent $192 million for something that is going to die off in a couple of months.[/quote]<br>
$192 million is not much, if 50000 dies of it and could be saved that cost the government much in lost tax money. If in 1/3 of US get sick of it that can be the reality much of US will stop for a time and cause big problems. If we says they just get sick in one week, even that will cost lots of money.</p>

<p>The price is cheap.<br>
It much more expensice if 1/3 of the country get sick one week than buy vaccine for them all.<br>
