    <description>Oh my god! Fast and Furious 7...
Has anyone recently been to watch it? Not going to spoil anything xD. I really recommend people who&#39;ve never watched a Fast and Furious movie to go ahead and watch this one! You&#39;ll absolutely love it. I&#39;ll leave a trailer down below for those who&#39;ve not watched FaF 7 yet, to get a rough idea of what it&#39;s about :D

              <p>I personally thought it was a breathe of fresh air from the producers and such. I loved the media, it had a bit of action along with a nice mix of emotion (blended it a tad bit better than how they usually did it). Not to mention the way they had did the memorial for Paul - loved it.</p>

              <p>normally after a FaF movie, it would be followed by a solid hoon sesh, we found ourselves going for a long cruise through a forest environment in memorial of Paul.</p>
<p>Another group (I wish I attended the event) went to the drive-ins, and after the tribute to paul, they all revved their engines in memorial &lt;3.</p>

<p>You really need to watch all of them to understand a lot of what is going on in this one. I liked it, but some things were over the top and felt like I was in a Michael Bay film.</p>
