    <description>Hello, my name&#39;s Tim.
So I created this project called Planet X - Nibiru in the beginning of summer.
It&#39;s been 23 days since it&#39;s launch, and it&#39;s still in BETA mode.
The server is currently shut off, and has been since September 24, 2014.
Due to me rewriting the source, client, and base into being 718 loading 803. 
It&#39;ll also have 35% more stability, than it already was and it contained no lag.
I fixed just about EVERY minor bug, and tried to maximize the server. 
Anyways, I&#39;m looking for 2 developers to join in on my development team. (Currently doing it solo)
And one person to do GFX work for me. This server is VPS hosted, has tons of unique content I&#39;ve personally added, and there&#39;s definitely more to be added, it has some player written content, a couple quests, and much more. If you&#39;re interested contact me via skype:

              <p>With your way of ordering things to server is just very poor, The advertising thread and the other asking for Dev’s thread. So i totally doubt that this is going anywhere unless you pick yourself up and maybe work in bit more ordered way, Just some advice for you.</p>
