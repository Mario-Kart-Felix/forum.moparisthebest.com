    <title>Gay Microsoft took it too far</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gay-microsoft-took-it-too-far/241287</link>
    <description>(There is a slight chance that this problem is somehow caused by myself, altough I doubt it.)

Fucking Microsoft! I use Chrome, as it is way better in my eyes then FF, and especially IE. But that doesnt matter here: it&#39;s about Hotmail/Windows live. For those who use it, you might have noticed that it&#39;s updated. It not only looks even more gay then it already did, then also deleted a few functions. You can&#39;t use the top bar to search in your emails anymore, but on top of that: it has lost it&#39;s compatibility with Chrome. I can&#39;t even type a fucking email. So now I have to type my emails in FF!

As you&#39;ve read in the firste sentence, there is a possibility that it&#39;s my fault somehow. If it is, excuse me for my rage and please tell me what I have to do to fix it.</description>

<p>Good sir, you fail right there by using hotmail. Gmail is better.</p>
<p>The only good products Microsoft has ever made were MS Office 2007 and XP. I can’t find anything else that Microsoft made that I enjoy.</p>
<p>Google chrome is nice but it’s shit at the same time. No adblock plugins, too many exploits, and I don’t think it looks “cool” at all.

I’ll just forward my hotmail emails to Gmail.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Good luck, if you figure out how can you tell me?  As far is I know hotmail won’t let you.</p>
<p>And if you use beta software, expect this kind of stuff to happen, stick with firefox at least until chrome is stable…[/quote]<br>
The most of the things Google have made is still in beta, even Gmail.<br>
So just wait 10 years and maybe Chrome is out of beta.</p>

If you want to use hotmail, install the Live Mail desktop client. Way better than the shitty web interface.<br>

Hotmail doesn’t work with the one that comes with vista.[/quote]<br>
I’m not talking about the one that comes with vista, I’m talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Mail" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>. It works just fine with hotmail.</p>

<p>Fucking Microsoft! I use Chrome, as it is way better in my eyes then FF, and especially IE. But that doesnt matter here: it’s about Hotmail/Windows live. For those who use it, you might have noticed that it’s updated. It not only looks even more gay then it already did, then also deleted a few functions. You can’t use the top bar to search in your emails anymore, but on top of that: it has lost it’s compatibility with Chrome. I can’t even type a fucking email. So now I have to type my emails in FF!</p>
<p>As you’ve read in the firste sentence, there is a possibility that it’s my fault somehow. If it is, excuse me for my rage and please tell me what I have to do to fix it.[/quote]</p>
<p>Good sir, you fail right there by using hotmail. Gmail is better.</p>
<p>The only good products Microsoft has ever made were MS Office 2007 and XP. I can’t find anything else that Microsoft made that I enjoy.</p>
<p>Google chrome is nice but it’s shit at the same time. No adblock plugins, too many exploits, and I don’t think it looks “cool” at all. It’s just more compact than unmodified FF.</p>
