    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/commands-against-owner-coowner-webclient-skilltab-glitch-pi-317/457339</link>
    <description>Hey im trying to find a piece a code to add to some commands to commands such as ::Jail, ::scare, ::mute, ::ban, etc so they can not be used against the main owner or co owner of an insidiax, trisidiax, or pi server. for ::jail i tried adding if (playerName.equals.ignoreCase(&quot;ownername&quot;);
c.sendMessage(&quot;You cannot jail the owner&quot;); or something like that and it compiled fine but it didnt not work at all so if anyone has an insight as to how to do this it would be appreciated.

Also on my webclient on rswebclients.com my new players all have 99/99 for their skills when in actuality they do not. so if anyone has some information as to how to fix that it will be appreciated, as i have no idea. 
BTW this is a 317 insidiax/trisidax source thats compatible with PI
Thanks in advance</description>
