[center][b]Yamasee War (1715–1717)[/b]
[i]By Arham Siddiqui[/i][/center]

	The Yamasee War is perhaps one of the most viscous wars between the Native Americans and the Colonists of South Carolina. Through this war, South Carolina colonists made unbelievable control of the coast. The Yamasee War had the widest variety of Native Americans in any of the wars previously. The Native Americans consisted of Yamasee, Muscogee, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Catawba, Apalachee, Apalachicola, Yuchi, Congaree, WaxHaw, Pee Dee, Cheraw, and other Native Americans.
	Reasons for fighting in the Yamasee War of 1715 differed among the many Indian groups who fought. Most fought due to unfair trading prices. Others fought due to taking land, the Indian slave trade, killing deer, increasing Indian debts to increase wealth to colonists, compete eagerness  for power among Indian groups, and also military spying on them.
	The battle began by the Yamasee attacking eastern South Carolina. The two parties of people consisted of several hundred men.  One party attacked the settlement Port Royal. By the time the Yamasee arrived, several hundred settlers founded refuge on the ship, whole many others had fled in canoes.  The second party attacked Saint Bartholomew’s Parish. This battle demolished plantations. The Native Americans had taken captives and killed over a hundred settlers and slaves. The two parties then met up and planned to eradicate South Carolina’s militia. When they got there, Governor Craven led a force of about 240 soldiers against the Yamasee. The Indians were very poorly suited for this battle. The two parties charged in, but found it very difficult to kill these troops. After a while, several head warriors were killed. The two parties however abandoned the battle and went different directions into the nearby swamps. The amounts of casualties were equal, 24. The result was that South Carolina had won. 
	Another person named Alexander MacKay led a force south. They had found 200 Yamasee who had taken cover there and attacked them. The Yamasee retreated as they got decimated by MacKay and about 100 men.
	A relatively small battle, known as the Daufuskie Fight, took place in the summer of 1715. A boat crew led by the Carolina’s had found a group 35 Yamasee and ambushed them, killing them all. Only one casualty for the South Carolina’s had taken place.
	As all the colonies were alerted by the attacks by the Native Americans, traders were also caught in the disaster. About 100 traders were selling goods until the Apalachee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Catawba, Cherokee, and other Native Americans came. The Native Americans creamed the traders, resulting with 90 kills by the Native Americans and 0 casualties caused by the traders. 
	One month of this disastrous war had past, and the South Carolina colonists turned their attention to the Catawba. The South Carolina colonists were hoping to make friends with the Catawba,

  however, the Catawba denied. In turn, the Catawba also murdered British traders nearby. By May 1716 the Catawba sent war parties against South Carolina settlers. About 400 Catawba along with 70 Cherokee caused disaster in the northern parts of the colonies. By June, Captain Thomas Barker sent a force of 90 cavalry and went north. The warriors’ party managed to ambush Barker’s cavalry and killed the all. Another force attacked Benjamin Schenkingh’s plantation, killing 20 people. By doing this, South Carolina had no defense for the wealth people of Goose Creek. Later, the Cherokee left as they heard that their own cities were being attacked by the South Carolina colonists. After this happened, George Chicken quickly formed a militia against the Catawba. By June 13, 1715, Chicken’s army ambushed the Catawba party and directly attacked the main Catawba force. This battle was named, The Battle of the Ponds. The Catawba warriors were not use to these tactics, so they quickly retreated back to their own villages. Later, the Catawba decided on peace.[/quote]

Thanks,
Arham

P.S: Didn&#39;t you laugh when you saw George Chicken? LOL</description>
