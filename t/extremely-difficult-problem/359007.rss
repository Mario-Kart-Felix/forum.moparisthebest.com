    <description>ok. this problem is hard to explain, my router sucks itself at night, not even joking. anyways, it refuses to be portforwarded. it is a piece of crap model that a local company gave me for free. i was wondering if i could direct route my internet into my computer and blow the thing up. i am trying to make a server called RoidScape the forums are here (roidscape.darkbb.com) feel free to visit. anyways i have made the forums what i need is either a way to not portforward or a diffrent base client but it would still need portforwarding. i have no clue about portforwarding it is hard to explain and difficult to understand but if you tell me it in a paragraph that isnt as sloppy as mine is i may be able to understand. im an A+ student with a great imagination i can understand or at least begin to comprehend. anyways! again. i need a way to skip portforwarding embed the server on my forums and mabye even find out if my router is already portforwarded...i have tried everything this is my last resort i already tried the utorrent thing and idk if it failed.</description>
