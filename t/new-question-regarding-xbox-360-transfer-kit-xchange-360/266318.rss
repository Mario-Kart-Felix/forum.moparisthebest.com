    <title>NEW QUESTION: Regarding xBox 360 Transfer Kit (xChange 360)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-question-regarding-xbox-360-transfer-kit-xchange-360/266318</link>
    <description>[s]Ok, as you all know a few internet plans have a thing called off-peak, where you download in a timespace and it doesn&#39;t cut into your data usage. Unfortunately, my plan has offpeak hours of 3am -&gt; 9am. Not much time, but enough to download a few episodes of shows etc. I was just wondering, is there anyway for me to set something up, which will start a torrent downloading at 3am, and end it at 9am?

I know I&#39;ll have to end up writing a Java application to do it for me, but I really cannot be fucked to do so.
[/s]
^ SOLVED.


[hr]
I have a transfer cord for the 360 (as below)

and when you buy the kit, it comes with a CD. I have lost my cd, as I had this kit when I first got my 120GB HDD. I just need the software, but cannot find a download. I believe the software is actually called xChange 360.

EDIT: I just rang xbox, and they say you cannot download. But surely someone has made a copy of the image.</description>
