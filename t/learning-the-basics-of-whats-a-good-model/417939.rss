    <description>ok, when making a model, one may think, 

1. what am i going to make?
2. how am i going to make it?
3. should i do it with primitives or tracing. 
4. what should the finished wireframe product look like?

Answer:

1. The answer is completely up to you. what you want to make is completely up to the
person making the &quot;model&quot;. 

2. You will need a modeling program. there are many ones out there but some free ones are
Metasequoia, and Blender. The programs that cost money are, cinema 4d, autodesk maya, 3ds max and others.

3. When modeling, you should ALWAYS start with primitives. FOR NOW ON only model with primitives. 
NO more tracing. Almost everyone HATES looking at a really messy/horrible wireframe. so please
you primitives.

4. your wireframe should NOT be in triangles. that just makes it look horrible as well.
an example of a wireframe that you should have is something like this.

dont ever make it look like this.(DONT EVEN POST IT)

an example of a Good wireframe is this.

(Java Is My Bitch&#39;s Model)





notice how this wireframe goes in a pattern, and looks nice and neat. that&#39;s how your models 
should look almost every time.

thanks for reading</description>

<p>well there should be a proper way of modeling. and tracing free hand isnt good. tracing with primitives is fine.</p>

<p>Spline modelling is a good method you can use, There is a method of spline modelling in maya, Tracing can be effective, after the point in which you understand polyflow. Its not use Tracing something that has 100 polys and a bad polyflow, While you can do the same in 450 polys, with perfect polyflow.</p>

<p>Just a side note, I wouldnt mention that online… Never know whos watching. Also On topic. Alot of people should learn from this. If someone makes a very detailed verison of this, It should be sticky. and new people SHOULD read it before posting. It might cut down on the amount of Poly overkill</p>
