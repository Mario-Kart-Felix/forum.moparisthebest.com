              <p>well since you appologized i guess i can let you “look” at it. It has had all the .java files removed but you can see how it works.<br>

In the future though think about how you phrase your questions. First word is “possible?” so i answered it in its entirety.</p>

              <p>thanks and but i already knew that u can use sprites but the client i saw like that was more like the old mopar 317 with like a small picture posted in the top right corner that just covered the minimap a bit. and the other side was the “orb” thing u guys are talking about just posted there and none of it matched.</p>
<p>if someone could direct me to a sprites tutorial ?</p>
<p>or how to change the frame that would be pretty cool.</p>
<p>thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/all">@all</a> for all your help</p>
<p>And <a class="mention" href="/u/grim">@grim</a><br>
sorry but sean was right all i wanted was to see it. i have an existing client i wouldnt just ditch it.<br>
and sorry for over reacting i guess u could call it</p>

<p>Telling someone you know of a client that does work with 317 and 508 but you’re not going to give them the link is just childish.  That’s like telling a 3 year old that you have a sucker but they can’t have it.  All you had to say was yes it is possible.[/quote]<br>
Read his question…he asked if it was possible. I did help by informing him it was. I dont want my friends work leeched. I answered his question so kindly gtfo</p>
