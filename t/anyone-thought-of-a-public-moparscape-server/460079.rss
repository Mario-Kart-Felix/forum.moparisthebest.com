    <title>Anyone Thought of a Public Moparscape server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-thought-of-a-public-moparscape-server/460079</link>
    <description>Since I&#39;m here in the &quot;Elite Server Owner Duscussion&quot;, I&#39;ve an Idea to make a huge Moparscape Server with the community.
What is going to get coded/developed/maintened by the &quot;Elite server owners&quot;

When i saw Moparscape had a Moparcraft server, for only mopar members, i thought maybe we make it so u can only log into the server with a Moparscape account.
Also you can repp+ and repp- ingame, and that will also change the repp on the forums...

Anyways what u think?</description>

              <p>yes, this has been thought of [and acted upon] several times here in this community. like Whackatre said, t4, sinisoul and s1gma all worked on a single source as a community server - though it ended in failure. also, agreeing with Whackatre again, it would fall down to a mess due to the ‘elite server owners’ being only in this certain field for financial gain. they aren’t interested, to my understandings, about programming at all. they just use the flexibility of online management and use that to their advantage.</p>
<p>hate to be brash, though i doubt you will ever complete such a task. it has been attempted innumerable amounts of times and all ending in failure. even the utmost respected members [for their programming abilities] fail at this. i honestly doubt MoparScape will ever get a ‘public server’ or, ‘community server’ which ever you want to call it, those seem to be the most popular titles.</p>
<p>if you decide to try and work on this, i wish you much luck. i doubt i’ll see anything of this, but who knows? it may happen if someone dedicates <span class="bbcode-b">a lot</span> of time and effort into it. i doubt it though.</p>

              <p>This is a bad idea; most ‘elite server owners’ are completely incompetent when it comes to programming and as a result, the project would quickly fall to a mess, due to problems most likely related to manageability. A ‘community server’ has been attempted many times and have all failed, even with the help of t4, sinisoul, and s1gma (some of the best programmers in this community). If even they cannot achieve it, how will you?</p>
<p>Unless you don’t really give a crap about actual programming and only want to add a shit load of content to a source, that might work. However, most people here (referring to people who have access to this board) are only interested in money and financial gain; if you produce a project consisting of several developers, nobody really gets any serious monetary benefit.</p>
<p>There was a thread in the general server discussion posted by Ruby a while ago (albeit fairly new); perhaps you could provide your input into that topic?</p>
