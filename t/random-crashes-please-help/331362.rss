    <title>Random crashes, please help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/random-crashes-please-help/331362</link>
    <description>I downloaded Quarantinezone from the download section and tried to have people connect. I set everything up great and it all works. I had 8 people online, and then it just crashed. Its not server load because it does this at even 2 people. What happens on the server cmd is it disconnects a player, and then it floods them trying to reconnect. Eventually it starts saying BANNING HOST: with their isp/info etc. after that. And it kicks everyone. The only fix is server restart. It occurs randomly and I havent seen a real cause of it in game, and I havent copied the exact server cmd. But Hopefully someone can tell me why it crashes randomly and prevents ANY reconnections?

I didnt edit any code.
I port forwarded (obviously, because people connected).
The server is the only thing running.

Unless this is just my connection (2mbps) I dont know whats wrong.
My pc is 6gb ram 64bit 3.ghz dual core processor, so its not being stressed. 
Ill come back tomorrow, hopeful for some help or some questions you guys have.

Thanks!
