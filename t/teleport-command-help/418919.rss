    <title>Teleport command help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/teleport-command-help/418919</link>
    <description>I have a PI based server. It won&#39;t do some commands that I see on tutorials, even the simplest, IE: Teleporting.

I need someone to connect to my teamviewer, and teach me how to make a simple command, because this server seems like it&#39;s not compatible with very much. I know someone is going to copy and paste some code in here, and then I try it, and I just get compiling errors. So anyways, someone please help =)</description>

              <p>I’ll give you the teleport code if you want it, but I’ll wait for a reply because you don’t seem to keen on wanting to try it.  You can also just base it off a command your server may already have such as ::home</p>
