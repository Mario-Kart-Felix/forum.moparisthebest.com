    <title>Linux - IPTables</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/linux-iptables/520194</link>
    <description>I use to use CentOS 6 to host my Runescape Classic server. Although I wasn&#39;t good with IPTables I managed to block a decent amount of bad traffic.

Now I put a new RSC Server back up on a Windows Server 2003 5 months later, now someones on a DDoS Spree. Switching from Staminus, they were doing 3-4GBPS Attacks. 

I then switched to a new host that can handle 10GBPS Attacks. I&#39;m still on a Windows Server and I want to switch to a CentOS 6 server again because IPTables and it can eb configured better against attacks. 

I&#39;m now getting hit with 14GBPS Attacks, which is quite hectic. Are there any experienced Linux users who would know how to configure IPTables and have any suggestions?

The only ports I use are, Port 80, Port 43594(TCP). I also have 32 usable IP Addresses.</description>
