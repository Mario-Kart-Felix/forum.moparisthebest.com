For those that say &quot;leech&quot; before logging in Heres some of what i have changed since it&#39;s been hosted (19/11/14)

Okay here we go:
[B][U]Fixed 3 Dupes[/U][/B]
[I]1, (Drop, Playersave in a fight dupe)
2, (Trade items, then teleport from dialogue - forces accept)
3, (Taking an item from the bank and closing the client)[/I]

[B][U]Fixed Many Bugs:[/U][/B]
- Client Freezing when teleporting to Revenants
- Being able to teleport out of jail using ::brimdung then ::tavdung straight away
- The nullpointer in packetsdecoder.java (Causing the server to lagg out and null accounts)
- Fixed the stability of the source (wouldnt hold more than 25 players without constant Dc&#39;s, Due to a memory leak from packetsdecoder)
- fixed 3 emotes 
- Added bank Tabs

[B][U]PvM[/U][/B]
- Added Drops to all Godwars Bosses
- Added Drops to the custom boss
- Fixed Bandos God (HP Bar would get stuck at around 50hp)
- Fixed revenants drops
- Many NPC&#39;s in the dungeons were AGGRESSIVE (Fixed)
- Fixed hits of Iron Drags

[B][U]PvP[/U][/B]
- Rarely occured (Players wouldnt lose items on death)
- fixed the long delay between eating (Now like RS)
- Sped up switching.
- Fixed the ::spec bug allowing players to use outside of wilderness now and not inside.
- Fixed wilderness Ditch
- Safe PvP Lever now works fully
[B][U]
Commands[/U][/B]
-Added ::Skull (its a pk server....)
- Super donators can ::bank

[B][U]Donator Benefits[/U][/B]
