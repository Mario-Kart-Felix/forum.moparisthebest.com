    <title>Converting pointers in c++ to c# equivilants</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/converting-pointers-in-c-to-c-equivilants/453275</link>
    <description>nvm I looked through some of the values in my code and found out a method isnt getting an address I need. i guess the modules is loaded for a little bit then it is disposed or something. :/ idk but when I check for the modules address its not listed in the modules.


With this bit of c++;
[code]
DWORD pWepMgr = *(DWORD*)(CShell+WeaponMgr);
[/code]

ok so am i wrong at thinking this basically says that the value produced will be the DWORD at the address CShell + WeaponMgr?

so would this be the same thing in c#;
[code]
ReadProcessMemory(hProcess, (IntPtr) CShell+WeaponMgr, buffer, 4, out bytesread);
uint pWepMgr = BitConverter.ToUInt32(buffer, 0);
[/code]

if what i did is correct then why does it return 0 in c# but in c++ it has some value?

thanks. I was trying to figure out what I did wrong for literally 24 hrs yesterday...</description>
