              <p>If you have already tried to portforward and succeeded, but other people cannot connect, then try Adding an exception in the Windows Firewall. Look up how to add an Inbound Rule, make it a port, 43594, make it TCP, make a another one, make it 43594, port, and UDP. Then, if people can’t connect and they are using your client you have not changed the IP in the client.</p>

              <p>He sounds like he needs something a bit more advanced than that.</p>
<p>Obviously you need a router, To find your routers IP Address, Go to Start&gt;Run&gt;CMD, Type in ipconfig and look for “default Gateway”, depending on your router will depend on the address. E.g. Most common is 192.168.0.1, But mine is 10.0.0.38.</p>
<p>Type your default gateway into the address bar. Go to <a href="http://www.portforward.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.portforward.com</a> and follow there steps on where to go for the portforward, But Port is: 43594 TCP/UCP.</p>
<p>Once you follow the tutorial, go into your Client folders, look for the folder GUI. Open that and press CRTL+F, Then Search for serverip or ip and find it. Then change it to your IPv4 which is found also where your default gateway is found. Also when you portforward, if it ask for Port then has 192.168.0.[] fill in the blank with the number your IPv4 has on the end of it. It might be, for example: 192.168.0.7.</p>
<p>If your friends downloaded the client make sure they change the ip to your ipv4 and they connect via your IP which can be found at <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.whatismyip.com</a></p>

              <p>to portward you need a router…</p>
<p>get your router’s ip address and type it into your URL.</p>
<p>Then go into setting’s application sharing and add the port of your server name it your server name = done</p>
<p>Now u have successively port warded</p>
<p>and another thing make sure your ip address for your client is not localhost<br>
E.G 127.0.0. or 0.0.0.0</p>
<p>This needs to be changed to a ni-ip or something similar.</p>
