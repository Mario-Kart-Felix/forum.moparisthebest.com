Of course you wouldn’t decide which one is superior based on the number of features. However, if C# has multiple good language features that java lacks - then clearly C# is superior. Here’s a comparison, doesn’t cover C# 5.0 though. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_C_Sharp_and_Java#Feature_comparison" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_C_Sharp_and_Java#Feature_comparison</a></p>
<p>And finally I have to say the obvious. C++ is the most superior language. Those who are interested should also read what the new C++11 standard adds. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11%5B/s%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11[/s]</a><br>

C# feature wise is far superior, the platform however, is a bit meh because it isnt completely multi platform, although Mono is getting close to fully supporting most of the important features.<br>

Assuming you mean ‘easiest to write code in’ and not ‘easiest to write a compiler/interpreter for’, that completely depends on the problem you’re trying to solve. Some languages are better suited to particular problems than others.</p>

<p>That’s good for you. Would you like a medal?[/quote]You’ve completely missed the point… Then again, I went on a tangent.</p>
<p>You took a <span class="bbcode-b">very</span> straightforward JAPH and claimed that it was obscure. JAPH seems to be ingrained in the Perl culture, not something that is obscure. And the entire point of a JAPH is to use obscure/surprising elements of the language in order to obfuscate the program. So, using something that is intentionally meant to be obscure to argue the language is obscure is completely retarded.</p>
<p>Also, the idea to write obscure code isn’t language specific… There are things like the International Obfuscated C Code Contest, and in more general terms, golfing. See: <a href="http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/</a></p>
<p>Anyway, you’re taking code that is intentionally made be obscure and pretending like it’s representative of the language as a whole, it’s not. Also, if you take a look at legitimate Perl applications, you’ll see that it’s not that bad.</p>

<p>Easy and best don’t come together. There are so many easy languages, but none of them are good. The worst kind of programmers are the hipsters. Even this forum has a few high profile hipsters - s1gma being the most notorious one. They learn a handful of these easy languages, at a mediocre level. Their principle is that the more hipster-languages you know the better. Most of these languages have no real world usage. But that doesn’t bother the hipsters - they like to sit on grass, have a picnic, discuss lisp, scala, python, java or whatever. However, the goal should be to master one or two superior languages. I recommend C++. It’s the most superior language, but also extremely difficult. Weigh your options carefully or you might get burnt. C# is also good.</p>

<p>Inb4flame for me not knowing anything about C++ these are just things that people told me.<br>

c++ is only frustrating due to the redundancy of std and shit that is spewed out on compilation/runtime error. i’d say c is more difficult to become good at since OO doesn’t exist - imo C is basically a really high level assembly.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re saying that C is more difficult because it doesn’t have classes? People write OO code in C. The perfect example of a C constructor/destructor pair are fopen and fclose. The C++ core language is huge, several times bigger than the C core language. There are so many language features (each of them has its use) and so many corner cases for each feature.</p>

<p>Easy and best don’t come together. There are so many easy languages, but none of them are good. The worst kind of programmers are the hipsters. Even this forum has a few high profile hipsters - s1gma being the most notorious one. They learn a handful of these easy languages, at a mediocre level. Their principle is that the more hipster-languages you know the better. Most of these languages have no real world usage. But that doesn’t bother the hipsters - they like to sit on grass, have a picnic, discuss lisp, scala, python, java or whatever. However, the goal should be to master one or two superior languages. I recommend C++. It’s the most superior language, but also extremely difficult. Weigh your options carefully or you might get burnt. C# is also good.</p>

<p>lol at python/java having no real world usage and C++ being difficult…</p>

<p>I’ve heard that C++ can be frustrating especially with memory allocation. There’s also alot that you can do wrong without even realising it.</p>
<p>Inb4flame for me not knowing anything about C++ these are just things that people told me.<br>

c++ is only frustrating due to the redundancy of std and shit that is spewed out on compilation/runtime error. i’d say c is more difficult to become good at since OO doesn’t exist - imo C is basically a really high level assembly.[/quote]</p>
<p>you do not need language enforced feature sets to write object oriented code. it’s done all of the time in C. look at the file system sub system in Linux, it serves as a great example.</p>
<p>to answer the topics question, my personal favorite is C. i love the control I have.</p>
