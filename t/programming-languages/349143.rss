    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/programming-languages/349143</link>
    <description>I see alot of the time people supporting a programming language over another programming language. The reason they support that language over the other one in most cases is because they learned it and they spent the time to learn the programming language so there going to back it up. Ive been searching the internet on the best &quot;programming language&quot; and what advantages each programming language has over another. So im having trouble...my background is JAVA.. and I want to move out learning different languages. So when it comes to looking for a new language.. what exactly should I be considering?</description>

It all depends on what you are doing, and where and how you are doing it.  Most of the time it boils down to preference.<br>
But if you want to be a programmer, you should probably get experience in different types of programming languages.<br>

What do you mean “where and how your doing it”?[/quote]</p>
<p>By that, I mean the programming language choices you have are different depending on if you are writing a program for a PC, a smart phone, or an integrated chip in a TV.  That’s the ‘where and how’.</p>

<p>Yes, Im defiantly going to stick with JAVA and of course stick around with the rsc community for as long as I can. There is alot about JAVA that I dont know and could learn and I will learn it over a period of time. The thing is… I have trouble teaching myself. Ill read books or the sun tutorials and Ill understand parts of it but have trouble “taking it in”.  If that makes any sense? Another issue I have is when I do write up a program I dont have anybody there to tell me how I could improve it.</p>

What do you mean “where and how your doing it”?</p>
<p>Im gonna be attending college soon (part time) and I dont know how schools teach computer programming or computer science. Is there a class specifically to teach people C or Haskel?</p>
<p>Im not a JAVA expert but I do know the basics+ so I was wondering would it be easier to master JAVA then master a programming language such as Python… or learn them both at the same time?</p>

              <p>While you are mostly right your categories are just paradigms.  Most of the languages you listed are multi-paradigm, i.e. they support several styles of programming.</p>

Native - C++, C.  Lots of languages can be compiled to native code, like some dialects of Lisp, OCaml, Delphi, others…<br>
Procedural/<span class="bbcode-b">Imperative</span> - All of the above to a degree.<br>
Functional - Varies.  Haskell is pure functional, Lisps support functional styles very well, but most aren’t strictly functional. Python is decent here as well.</p>

</aside>
<p>Nitpicking here, ‘Lisp’ (or LISP, though this usually implies McCarthy’s original dialect) is quite a broad generalization.  Scheme itself is a Lisp, as is Common Lisp, Clojure, and a bunch of others I don’t care to list.  Lisp refers to the family of languages that are Lisp dialects.  Saying that everything is done via recursion is simply not true.  In fact, Common Lisp was the first standardized OOP language (CLOS).  That on its own does not break away from being purely functional, but OOP tends to lean towards imperative programming, of which Common Lisp has always allowed for, along with most others.  Clojure, for example, is nearly pure functional in the sense that all data structures are immutable, however there are mutable references (atom, agent, ref), and naturally being on the JVM imperative code is possible (though usually hackish).</p>
<p>If you want to see a language where ‘everything’ is done via recursion, take a stab at Haskell…</p>

<p>But if you want to be a programmer, you should probably get experience in different types of programming languages.  These are just examples and there are multiple languages you could use for each category.</p>
<p>Object Oriented - C++, Java, Python<br>

Procedural - C, Pascal<br>
Functional - Lisp, Scheme (neat as well, EVERYTHING is done via recursion)<br>
Logical - Prolog (this is neat, it may just blow your mind)<br>
Declarative - SQL, such as MySQL (you just say what you want to do, don’t care about how it’s done)</p>
<p>I’ve used all of the above at one time or another, and it is interesting to see how different the same program can be in two different languages.  Sometimes the same program will be 5 lines in Prolog, and 100+ in C, or vice versa, depending on what you want to do.  It will give you a good base for the future so you can use the right tool for the job.</p>

              <p>truth be told, there is no ‘best’ programming language. spend time on 1 language, learn the libraries until you can work your way around the language without googling classes/functions you’d commonly use. even an entry level language, if you spent a lot of time working with it, you’d be able to create much more than messing around trying to find a ‘best’ programming language.</p>
<p>then once you learn how things work on that language, moving onto another one will be a lot easier than beginning from scratch.</p>
<p>if your in java i’d suggest stick with it, mess around with rsc servers (since they’re all java) and you may even learn quicker than normal.</p>
<p>why do you want to move out learning different languages? beginners seem to think if they’re on a language that they can’t make something they want in, it’s because of the language, so they tend to browse around at other languages to see if things can become easier and they can make some cool stuff, in the end it just fucks them around more.</p>
