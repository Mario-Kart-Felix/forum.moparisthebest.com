    <description>How do i make a readable book in pi base. Like i want to make a request gamebook button and it shows all the Rules and stuff and i was wondering how do i make that? I&#39;ve seen a book reading tut at moparscape / rune-server but that was a different base.

+

How do i make so a npc teleport you to places, like a guide.
With that i mean, when we click on him, he will teleport to places and show us places in game ( we can&#39;t teleport or walk )

and when we done he teleport us back.

Thanks. ;D</description>
