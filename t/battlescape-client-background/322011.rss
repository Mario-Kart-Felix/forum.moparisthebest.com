    <title>BattleScape Client Background</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/battlescape-client-background/322011</link>
    <description>Hey guys. IK I sound really nooby right now, but I need help with changing the background. 

It&#39;s a BattleScape client. I downloaded the Image_Packer and put it in the client. I changed the background, then compiled within the image packer. Then I clicked Pack.bat and it worked (supposedly). Then I compiled my client, clicked run.bat, then it loaded. It was still loading the same background image :(

Did I do something wrong, or am I missing something? Help is needed!</description>

              <p>Just go under the sprites, most of the time its under files then you see something called sprites, click on it and look for the background.</p>
