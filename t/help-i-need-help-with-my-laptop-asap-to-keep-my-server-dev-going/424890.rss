<blockquote>Your laptop is trying to start via its network adapter; it is searching for a server on your network which contains valid operating system images. This means that the hard drive of your laptop is not found, or that the installation of your operating system is severely corrupted. The first cause is the most likely though, that your hard drive is damaged. Enter the BIOS of your laptop and see if the hard drive is still recognised there. It most likely is not, meaning you will have to purchase a new hard drive. All your data will be lost if your hard drive is damaged; a professional recovery centre could recover your data, but it would cost you a lot of money, which is never worth it for home users, only for large corporations.</blockquote>
