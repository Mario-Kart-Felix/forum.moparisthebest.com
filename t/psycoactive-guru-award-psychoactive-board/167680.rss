    <description>Well, seeing SL&#39;s java guru award gave me an idea, and i thought, that these forums aren&#39;t JUST programming, we have a lot of drug pro&#39;s here to! so i thought about it, and i envisioned topics upon topics about drugs that are floating aimlessly in there boards, so why don&#39;t we have a few boards for drugs? maybe even a whole section? and if we had a section/board then why not an award? so i made this award icon (note: this is only for demonstration purposes i suck at graphics so it will not be the actual one unless chosen to be by others)

[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/8827/070415abraju7.png[/img][/URL]

i did my best, I&#39;m sucky at graphics though.</description>

              <p>There is no fear of getting caught, for one thing it’s totally legal to give a child an alcoholic beverage. But the reason it is legal is because it cannot be enforced. Which that situation applies to our current situation. I did not say we should promote drug use/abuse, or underage alcoholism, but I think to be a more productive community we shouldn’t restrict certain areas because of fear of legal action, or imposing ideals on smaller children.</p>
<p>I would like to think that-maybe not a majority-but alot of members of this community are mature enough to make their own decisions, as well as to handle the repercussions that occur because of that action. Now I may have branched out into totally different subjects in my initial post. But I do agree with you Lothy about not promoting Illegal activity, although I do believe there should be some leniency with illegal activity. Now I know Drug topics are on here, and that’s a good start, but I still believe warez should make a return.</p>
<p>At one time was there an Offbeat section? If there was, I think it should be reinstated, in the main category, that would be more than formidable for drug topics, and other areas of interest in that field.</p>

<p>Do you avoid giving alcohol to a really young child because you fear getting caught, or do you avoid giving it to them simply because it’s actually bad for them? (young child being someone around the age of 10)<br>
I can only hope it would be the latter.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:25, topic:167680”]…<br>
The client is illegal.</p>
<p>If you want to get into the nitty gritty though then the first one is questionable: The code for the server was written from scratch by winterlove, so naturally Jagex don’t own it. As for their protocol, I couldn’t tell you which bit actually belongs to them - it couldn’t possibly be storing various types as bytes in an array though, because that’s not uncommon.</p>
<p>However, having said all of that, since when have you seen a member of staff actively telling people to make emulations of the runescape server, or actively telling people to reverse engineer other people’s intellectual property?<br>
We do neither, simply because it would make the website more vulnerable to any legal attack, and are therefore not actively encouraging anything illegal.<br>
Giving out awards for doing so would also encourage illegal activity. That’s why awards are for programming in general, instead of being runescape hacking related directly.[/quote]</p>
<p>So are you saying the Terms of Service people have to agree to before visiting this site, isn’t actually legally binding in any way? Is it used to project some form of false security for the members of this forum to make them feel secure? It seems to me that if anyone were to take legal action it would be Jagex, and already if Jagex visits this site they are in breach of the Terms of Service, Or anyone with relations to them for that matter.</p>
<pre><code>    So what is it exactly you all are afraid of? If any action were to be taken, it would be from the US Gov't. I don't see any need to worry in that case. If anything I think the website should be hosted on servers located in an area where drug use isn't illegal, underage drinking, and Warez aren't an issue. That would postpone any legal action taken by the US or UK Government. Not to mention the TOS could be revised to remove some more loopholes, and make it more legally binding. 
</code></pre>
<p>To be honest Mitb has been pushed into a corner, having Warez removed, separating MoparScape from these forums. At this point, this forum is just a stripped down networking community if anything. I would like to see the return of a warez section on the website. Possibly a Torrent database. and have like Demonoid where you must join, and only at certain times can people join. I mean with an inconspicuous name like Moparisthebest, it doesn’t attract much attention from any outsiders. Besides the fact most of the members here are devoted to coding in general. I don’t see why there couldn’t be a warez section. I believe that would be a smart way to revolutionize this forum, or even make it an open source community project, like people have wanted in the past.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve begun to ramble, and get off track, I’m done. I may even start a topic about some of the ideas I struck.</p>

I don’t think this will happen since these boards are populated mainly by little kids, plus what good is that award if I can’t get it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"><br>

              <p>Where do silly ideas like this one come from?</p>
<p>Sure, this is a discussion website. Yes, talk about drugs seems to come up a lot; if minors aren’t into drugs then they’re usually into alcohol. Naturally talk about such things is bound to come up when taking the userbase into consideration.<br>
However that doesn’t mean we are going to hand out awards to actually encourage illegal activity.</p>
<p>We will never actively promote illegal behaviour, and obviously awarding people for doing illegal drugs is just that - promotion of criminal activity.<br>
If you enjoy going out on the weekends and doing various drugs then fine, nobody is stopping you. But nobody will encourage you to do so either.</p>

              <p>[quote=“dragonus18, post:1, topic:167680”]Well, seeing SL’s java guru award gave me an idea, and i thought, that these forums aren’t JUST programming, we have a lot of drug pro’s here to! so i thought about it, and i envisioned topics upon topics about drugs that are floating aimlessly in there boards, so why don’t we have a few boards for drugs? maybe even a whole section? and if we had a section/board then why not an award? so i made this award icon (note: this is only for demonstration purposes i suck at graphics so it will not be the actual one unless chosen to be by others)</p>

<p>i did my best, I’m sucky at graphics though.</p>
<p>Hey Dragonus, your like fucking 14. Something tells me that you smoked for one of the first times with your friends, and you came home later all hyped up about this and pulled this stupid shit. Drug section? Ain’t happenin, these are RuneScape based forums, filled with people who either play RuneScape, or used to. Whens the last time you got out smoked by a fucking runescaper, shit ain’t happening.[/quote]</p>
