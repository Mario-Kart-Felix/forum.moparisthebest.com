    <description>Alright. I&#39;ve made a clanwars, and I need to make a timer for 15 minutes, when the 15 minutes is up, you are teleported back to the waiting room. Pretty much the same thing as castlewars. If you can help me, thanks.

Oh and could you tell me where to put it aswell? Thank you. 

Coding skills = -3? -.- Sorry,</description>
