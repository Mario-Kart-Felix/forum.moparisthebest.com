Point is, you and everyone else that likes the game would enjoy it more without SoF or Solomons (except the people that spend tons of money on p2w games), but no one can put their finger exactly on why and thats the problem. You still love runescape so you’re trying as hard as you can to not let these features hit you hard, so you’re overly rationalizing them and trying to accept it.</p>
<p>It ruins games.  Games that go from pay to relying on micro-transactions are a surefire way you can tell that its dying.</p>
<p>By the way you look at it being “why care, it doesnt effect you” etc etc you might aswell go play a single player game. Online games are about even more world immersion with other players, not “wow what extremely difficult boss did you nearly die trying to kill for that platebody???” “oh none m8 bought on solomons”</p>
<p>Jagex could have made a new hard quest for every outfit on solomons, and maybe some mini fun quests like the feline outfit from gertrudes cat etc, and people would pay monthly to have a shot at that content.</p>
<p>They undercut themselves and Jagex is a complete disappointment as a company. Whoever suggested these MicroT ideas should be fired, along with the designers who didn’t stand up against them.</p>

Just because someone is rich doesn’t mean they are going to buy spins. Just because someone is poor doesn’t mean they wont buy spins. It all comes down to who wants to waste money on the SOF, not who has better real life standing. Same thing as buying RSGP. Honestly you’re being over dramatic. If you look at someone rich in-game do you think “wow he must have bought a lot of spins”? No, and I don’t think ANYONE does, because that would be moronic. You think he either bought RSGP or he earned it, and SOF has nothing to do with it.<br>

<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if Andrew left BECAUSE he saw this coming. If I saw my game going down the drain I would cash in my company share for $650M too.[/quote]From someone that does the same thing for World of Warcraft (rationalizing everything), don’t you see where I’m coming from? Personally I think Solomons general store was a great update. I love everything about it, hands down. I think giving people the opportunity to buy purely cosmetic items and support JaGex is great. I don’t feel like I’m rationalizing that at all, it’s purely by choice if someone feels like they care about cosmetic items. As for earning them other ways, that would also be great (and they do still do that), but Jagex needs money and this is fine. It’s cosmetic. If you care about that stuff you can buy it or just use the other in-game cosmetic items, if not you don’t need to bother spending money at all. The Squeal of Fortune is a different story, I think people being able to buy XP lamps is bad. It’s a tiny about of XP relatively, but still. I think whining about the gp part of it is ludicrous as I said earlier, but I do agree that as a whole the SOF needs a rework. I have nothing against selling spins, but I don’t think it should give out XP, and the money values should maybe be decreased a little, or make sure the 200m prize is extremely rare (I’m not sure how rare it is, but I’ve only seen one documented case of someone getting it).</p>
<p>As for immersion: everyone knows which items are cosmetics and which are earned, maybe for weapons that’s a bit different but the normal outfits are really just for things like roleplaying or creating good-looking outfits. And for those types of people, it doesn’t usually matter how you got the gear. If this was epic looking armor it may be different, but it isn’t <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> The weapons are a bit of a stretch, but as you can’t view cosmetic items in PvP areas it’s meh.</p>
<p>Creating new content for each outfit is possible, but you need to remember they do that already. A ton of the cool outfits are earned, but they needed to pull in money and creating solomons general store was a good move I think.</p>
<p>The point is Jagex needed to start making more profit to please the ‘big bosses’, I suggest you look into it because it actually is a sad story. Microtransactions was the easiest solution obviously, what else could they do? It’s hard to force people to buy enough subscriptions, they tried the subscription promotions and it obviously didn’t work well enough.</p>

        <p>Don’t compare this to WoW, they literally sell like 3 mounts and 3 pets that can follow you, two of which have been rewards to donating to childrens hospitals. Blizzard has already said theyll never do MicroT’s on a scale of other games, because its not in the spirit of the game.</p>
<p>Other solutions? Fire workers, work on getting the game back to 2006 content quality, hire them back.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t talking about WoW’s micro-transactions, I was talking about how it’s a bad game but you constantly argue for it <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I feel like their new content is getting better, but it isn’t helping them get subscriptions back. And the 2006 bandwagon is annoying, the only reason people actually care about it is nostalgia, not because the content was better. There is tons of amazing (some not-so amazing, but still) content since then. Really, everything back then was just simpler. I look at update logs since 2006 and there really isn’t much I’d remove.</p>

<p>All the new minigames are great though[/quote]You’ve said their money making method should be to fire developers, then said it wasn’t the content. So what do you suggest they do to make a profit instead? That’s really what four of the six items you listed are about (not counting wildy removal, as that was fixed). The website update is not bad content either, I like it and it’s just personal preference. The armor graphics update is also personal preference, I like 90% of the updated pieces, and the reason people don’t like it is purely nostalgia.</p>
<p>As for the Grand Exchange, I am torn. I feel like people are missing out on a lot of things when it isn’t there, but I also like the way the economy worked when it wasn’t there. It made things easier when they added it, and whether or not that is a bad thing is complicated. One thing I really don’t like about it is how the GE is the main hub of ALL activity now, wheras they should really focus on making each city be popular and busy.</p>

        <p>Well I personally think that runescape in 2003-2007 was the best. I enjoyed standing in varrock bank spamming for the items I wanted to buy or sell. The GE has made things ways to easy. There was a time when runescape was run off a single server in the creators attic. I think that instead of having updated the game to this date where it is almost unrecognisable was a stupid idea, first off most people’s graphics card cannot even run runescape anymore second they should have done what they have done with runescape classic and leave it running as a different game and then released a runescape 3 with the better graphics and stuff. Runescape used to be fun but now they are just getting greedy and doing all they can to get cash out of us.</p>
<p>It is a perfect example of why so many people have turned to runescape private servers and why so many people are trying to make a 2006 remake of rs. As lots of us who played in 2006 will agree. They were the glory days.</p>

        <p>[quote=“bibbobbib, post:35, topic:456438”]Well I personally think that runescape in 2003-2007 was the best. I enjoyed standing in varrock bank spamming for the items I wanted to buy or sell. The GE has made things ways to easy.[/quote]Are you serious? Why would I waste my time yelling at varrock or falador for an item when I can now select it on the interface to get it.</p>
<blockquote>There was a time when runescape was run off a single server in the creators attic. I think that instead of having updated the game to this date where it is almost unrecognisable was a stupid idea,</blockquote>
I don't think today's kids would play it if the graphics were like in RSC or even the old RS2.
<blockquote>first off most people's graphics card cannot even run runescape anymore</blockquote>
Use lowest settings, it works! miracle. :)
<blockquote>Runescape used to be fun but now they are just getting greedy and doing all they can to get cash out of us.</blockquote>
Today's updates are not like they were back in the days where they would release some huge place once in 3 months. They are constantly improving areas and graphics, adding new training spots and whatnot. Do you really think it's easy and cheap to handle such game what it is today?
<blockquote>It is a perfect example of why so many people have turned to runescape private servers and why so many people are trying to make a 2006 remake of rs. As lots of us who played in 2006 will agree. They were the glory days.</blockquote>Only because you are slowly losing interest, not that it was the best at that year.
<p>The only problem I personally see in this game is the goldfarming bots, if they didn’t exist this game would kick ass even more.</p>
