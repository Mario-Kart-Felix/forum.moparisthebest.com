        <p>[quote=“Loveandpower, post:1, topic:456546”]He does have a point…programming rsps is  pointless.[/quote]Lol. Why do you always completely miss the point of a post?</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span> - Honestly he’s just sad that RuneScape has turned into what almost every other game has, which is a way to profit. Jagex had two options really. One was to raise the subscription costs for everyone to be closer to other games. This would hurt a LOT more people. What they did was create OPTIONAL ways to buy things (and I think the cosmetic items is perfect, even if the sof does seem a bit pay-to-win), so that only those that wanted to had to spend more money. Really, people are QQing over this when a ton of other games cost so much more.</p>

It means a fresh world of opportunity and reward. I thought that as a moderator you would understand how to read a post? And so you haven’t noticed a change in the community except for the fact that people are angry? People are angry because, especially with the 400m reward, money is no longer about skills in-game. The “fresh world” was that anyone with <span class="bbcode-b">any</span> financial background (provided they had internet and a computer) could be rich in-game. Now, it is easier for people willing to spend real-life money on it.</p>

<p>It means a fresh world of opportunity and reward. I thought that as a moderator you would understand how to read a post? And so you haven’t noticed a change in the community except for the fact that people are angry? People are angry because, especially with the 400m reward, money is no longer about skills in-game. The “fresh world” was that anyone with <span class="bbcode-b">any</span> financial background (provided they had internet and a computer) could be rich in-game. Now, it is easier for people willing to spend real-life money on it.[/quote]First off, don’t insult me because I asked what something means. I read the post fine but I had never heard the expression “fresh world of opportunity and reward”. Why does the word “fresh” make sense in this context? Secondly, there has been ONE logged instance of someone winning the 400m reward, and they bought TONS of spins. Fourthly, the cash rewards are extremely rare, even the 500k one is rare. Thirdly, someone spending X hundred dollars to win X hundred million has ALWAYS been going on (even though in this case it’s random), if anything I think it’s better for Jagex to get this money rather than people breaking the rules or botting to make cash, what about you? Fifthly, it’s not ‘easier’ for people to spend real life money on it, buying 500 spins or whatever and crossing your fingers for a lucky hit is not easier than buying 200m off playerauctions.</p>

<p>Call me crazy but I like knowing every wearable armor ingame can be achieved with a challenge, not real world financial standing.[/quote]I know what you mean, but that time past ages ago. Longggggg before the SOF. Though remember the ‘lucky’ versions of armor do look different, so you can tell if someone got it off the SOF or earned it. Then again you can’t tell if they bought RSGP anyways, so like I said, that time is past.</p>

<p>I did not insult you, don’t be so dramatic. I’ve won the 100k three times and the 500k one twice. “Fresh” is because people play games to get away from real life. It should be new, rather than real life where the rich are rich and the poor are poor. And I’d rather the players sell money rather than JaGeX sell money. That way, players are getting money from putting work and effort in. JaGeX are just adding to their ever-growing coffers.</p>

        <p>Just because someone is rich doesn’t mean they are going to buy spins. Just because someone is poor doesn’t mean they wont buy spins. It all comes down to who wants to waste money on the SOF, not who has better real life standing. Same thing as buying RSGP. Honestly you’re being over dramatic. If you look at someone rich in-game do you think “wow he must have bought a lot of spins”? No, and I don’t think ANYONE does, because that would be moronic. You think he either bought RSGP or he earned it, and SOF has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>And ranger, yes you insulted me.</p>

Just because someone is rich doesn’t mean they are going to buy spins. Just because someone is poor doesn’t mean they wont buy spins. It all comes down to who wants to waste money on the SOF, not who has better real life standing. Same thing as buying RSGP.<br>

<p>It’s a lot cheaper to buy spins than it is to buy 400m. I never said that they <span class="bbcode-b">would</span>, I said that they <span class="bbcode-b">could</span>.[/quote]Well first off, you can’t win 400m anymore. It’s half that. And 200m is like 80 dollars, and you’d have to spend more than that to be relatively likely to get the prize on SOF. Also I edited my main post. And saying ‘could’ has no meaning at all. Someone poor ‘could’ steal 500 dollars to spend on the sof, but that doesn’t mean they ‘would’</p>
<p>Really it all comes down to this:</p>

[/quote][/quote]In other words, you guys are extremely exaggerating the influence of the cash rewards of the SOF. Until the cash rewards become common enough to safely say someone could buy spins to get money easier than RWT, it’s just being stubborn to say that SOF is ruining the feeling of accomplishment more than RWT is. I agree with you guys that a lot of the feeling of accomplishment is gone, but it’s definitely not because of the SOF. People were just looking for something to blame this loss on, and Jagex provided it.</p>
<p>For things like XP lamps it’s a different story, but still.</p>

<p>Point is, you and everyone else that likes the game would enjoy it more without SoF or Solomons (except the people that spend tons of money on p2w games), but no one can put their finger exactly on why and thats the problem. You still love runescape so you’re trying as hard as you can to not let these features hit you hard, so you’re overly rationalizing them and trying to accept it.</p>
<p>It ruins games.  Games that go from pay to relying on micro-transactions are a surefire way you can tell that its dying.</p>
<p>By the way you look at it being “why care, it doesnt effect you” etc etc you might aswell go play a single player game. Online games are about even more world immersion with other players, not “wow what extremely difficult boss did you nearly die trying to kill for that platebody???” “oh none m8 bought on solomons”</p>
<p>Jagex could have made a new hard quest for every outfit on solomons, and maybe some mini fun quests like the feline outfit from gertrudes cat etc, and people would pay monthly to have a shot at that content.</p>
<p>They undercut themselves and Jagex is a complete disappointment as a company. Whoever suggested these MicroT ideas should be fired, along with the designers who didn’t stand up against them.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if Andrew left BECAUSE he saw this coming. If I saw my game going down the drain I would cash in my company share for $650M too.</p>
