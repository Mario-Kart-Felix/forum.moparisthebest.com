    <title>Need help with Ansgar</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-ansgar/442321</link>
    <description>You can see the development progress of Ansgar [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,544955.0.html#top]here[/url].

We need help with the development of Ansgar. What we are looking for mainly is a web developer, and someone who knows their way around a VPS (we don&#39;t have one of these yet, but we hope to soon. For now we are using 39dll.dll). 

Also anyone who would like to help with graphics and or sound effects as well as music is welcome. We are building everything completely from scratch so any help is greatly appreciated.</description>
