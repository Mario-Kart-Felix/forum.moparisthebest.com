    <description>     I&#39;m looking for a partner or two to work on a #317 framework with me. If your interested you can fill out the form below. 

     My initial approach was going to be to work with the Naga library which makes use of the NIO reactor pattern but simplified down when implemented, I&#39;m completely open to change and have no real set design yet. I do however have some notes written down but none implemented or tested.

[code]
Server Design:
   - Run 
     Initializes the application and the server&#39;s as-well as any other start-up utilities.

     - RuneScapeServer
       A parent class which a login server and JAGGRAB server can be derived from.
       - bind()
           Initializes the networking.
      - listen()
           Listens for activity.
            
        - LoginServer
          An implementation of the RuneScapeServer, networking would be bound here as well as listening for connections.

        - JAGGRABServer
           Another implementation of the RuneScapeServer, the JAGGRAB server would be bound on a different port here and its components would be initialized.
[/code]

[code]
Entity Design:

     - Entity (The parent class for all entities)
        Would hold variables that all mobile and still entities share. 

        - MobileEntity
           An extension of the entity class it would hold all variables mobile entities share.
           - NPC
           - Player

        - StillEntity
           An extension of the entity class it would hold all variables still entities share.
           - Object
           - GroundItem

I am aware some people like to add Projectiles and Graphics into their entity system but I just don&#39;t feel it would be anymore productive. I am open to change on this if a good reason is provided.
[/code]

Like I said before these systems are not final and I was just taking notes as I went, this is not near the entirety of the expected content in the server.
