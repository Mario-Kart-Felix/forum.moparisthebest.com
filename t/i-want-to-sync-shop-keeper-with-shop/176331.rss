              <p>Ok (hope im not doing this for nothing…)</p>
<p>Ok So when you spawn him it wont work like did you do like this<br>
(example)<br>
::npc 50<br>
(im not saying that you did that type of npc thou)</p>
<p>If you did it that way you are waaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy off trying to make a shop this is how you do it::</p>
<p>Step:1 Go to C:/ drive</p>
<p>Step:2 Got to Programfiles</p>
<p>Step:3 Search in that file for Moparscape (not running the game)</p>
<p>Step:4 after opening Moparscape (not running the game)<br>
go to Hybridscape which is in the the folder Moparscape</p>
<p>Step:5 after opening Hybridscape<br>
go to autospawn and open it as Notepad</p>
<p>step:6<br>
In side the file will look like this<br>
spawn = 494	3256	3418	0	0	0	0	0	1	NPC</p>
<p>(numb and letter code info)<br>
Spawn = ID HERE		Xcoord		Ycoord	  DontChange  RangeX1   RangeY1<br>
RangeX1    RangeX2   walktype     Discription Of the Npc<br>
(numb and letter code info)</p>
<p>So you  put In<br>
Spawn = Right here put the id<br>
Then<br>
The Xcoord<br>
Then<br>
the Ycoord<br>
then<br>
have the rest like this<br>
0	0	0	0	0	2	MyshopKeeper1</p>
<p>Then Save your work<br>
then play <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>How to get X and Y coord</p>
<p>Open Moparscape ( run the game )<br>
Login<br>
Walk to the area you want him to be<br>
press F4<br>
then where the X and Y coords need to be in the file put them where they are sopost to be…</p>
