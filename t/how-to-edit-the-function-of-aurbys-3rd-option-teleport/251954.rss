    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-edit-the-function-of-aurbys-3rd-option-teleport/251954</link>
    <description>There is a NPC named Aubruy in the Real RS he in located South-East Part of Varrock in the Magic shop. If u right click him you have 3 Main Options Talk, Trade, and Teleport. I know how to make him talk (case 155) and i know to make him bring up a shop (case 17), but how do i use the 3rd option teleport. i would like to get him to teleport you to the Essence Mine, But if i no one has a answer i could always give players the option to teleport to the Essence Mine when they talk to him!</description>
