    <description>I recently saw a post by the user in the title stating that if you added him on MSN, he would fix ANY problem. Well i added him to my MSN list and told him i needed help coding the thing that makes NPC drop thins via npcdrops.cfg. He said No, I will not help you there is a tut in moparisthebest.com on that. I said no theres not... (There really isn&#39;t) and he sent me some message that said there is a tutorial on coding the npc drops for project 16 v.4.5 made by Texasmd91. (There isn&#39;t) Then blocked me. I also reffered him to a friend and my friend asked him how to make buttons do different things. All he did was tell my friend this exact quotes &quot;www.codefasga.com&quot; and block him. I am complaining about losers like this who are just wannabes. I&#39;m telling you now, don&#39;t waste your time adding this loser.</description>
