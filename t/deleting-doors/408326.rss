    <title>Deleting Doors?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/deleting-doors/408326</link>
    <description>Well, I just completely started over with a new source and client (Hybrid Pk) and I wanted to make a unique home. There are a few doors in the area I have chosen that cannot be opened. I need to remove these doors (I&#39;d rather remove them than have them open/close), but I&#39;ve yet to find a tutorial that actually works. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</description>
