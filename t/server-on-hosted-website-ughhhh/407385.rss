    <title>Server on hosted website ughhhh</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-on-hosted-website-ughhhh/407385</link>
    <description>Ok I&#39;m having a real hard time here. I&#39;ve looked for a good tut but all the ones I&#39;ve found are for private servers and not how to put them on a hosted website.

I have done them several times on several different pc&#39;s as private servers. Now I&#39;m trying to put one on a hosted website. I&#39;ve done the tut for a Custom Client (YaY!!!!!!) but I can&#39;t get the .bat files to run on the hosted website therefore the server I&#39;m trying to connect to with the custom client isn&#39;t running. Anyone know any tricks on getting the .bat files to run on a hosted website. I&#39;m using Godaddy as my host and I own the domain name I have everything uploaded to.

Thanks in advacne</description>
