    <description>I got some annoying glitches in my server. They are:
1. If you use prayer, no-one will see the hits or talk.
2. If you are close to kq you can&#39;t see your talk, and if you hit kq you can&#39;t see your hits.
3. People can attack slayer monsters with mage, anyway to fix this?
I would hope someone could awnser.</description>

              <p>Okay, thanks for those 2 awnsers. I meaned people attack with magic some slayer monsters, like dark beasts, and they would need 100 slayer, but they can still attack to the beast with 1 slayer, if they use mage.</p>

              <p>Prayer only works on 317 clients, so if your using silabsoft or moparscape, it won’t let you see what people are saying.</p>
<p>Kalphite queen has protect from range and magic on all the time, so since it’s using prayer, you can’t see it’s HP.</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t you want people to be able to attack slayer monsters with magic?</p>
