    <title>Need some helpful people?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-helpful-people/466385</link>
    <description>hi, i&#39;ve always wanted my own rsps. I joined moparscape because it&#39;s full of people who know what they&#39;re doing. I&#39;m a smart guy and catch on quickly, however i know very little about making a server. I&#39;m thinking i need a easy 317 source and client to start with. If you have a good one or if you have any useful information to help me out feel free to message or email me. I&#39;l be sure to give you credit when i have a running server and staff ofcourse.</description>

              <p>Now, I started off with a delta source called “Dragon History” you can google “Dragon History full package” to get the downloads, It’s not a source you should use to make a private server. It’s mostly for learning perposes in my opinion. Once you get more confortable coding/programming the source and you feel you’re ready for a challenge pm me and i’ll send you a more advanced source <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Go to the downloads section, you’d want to start with a 317. Look for one you like, download it and start to work on it.</p>
