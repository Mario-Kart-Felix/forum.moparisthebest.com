    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-noob-questions-that-i-need-answered/192471</link>
    <description>1) How can I change the way my NPC&#39;s face?
2) I&#39;ve set RangeX and RangeY and changed the walktype to 2, in autospawn.cfg yet the monsters will will not walk around.
3) Somebody please give me the codes, or a freaking link to PROPER working potions. (I.E strength potions, your strength loweres from 117 strength back to 99 within a set of time etc)</description>
