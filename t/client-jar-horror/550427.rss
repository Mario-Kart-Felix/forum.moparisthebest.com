    <title>Client .jar horror</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-jar-horror/550427</link>
    <description>Hey guys! 

Me and a friend are working on a rsps. ITs working and running on a vps. Also after changing the ip in the client to the ip from the vps we can play on the client that came with the source. BUT we are now working more then 2 days on making that client into a jar file. And we can still not get it to work after 1million tutorials. 

So please is there a super pro who can help us make that .jar.. You will get co owner on our server or get some money on PP!

Please haha!  :|</description>

<p>You’re retarded. In order to jar your client you need to delete your java files. As for coding with the client once he deletes them, i’d expect him to have made a copy beforehand. Try harder, kid.[/quote]<br>
Sadly to say, you don’t have to delete your java files.</p>
<p>[quote=“Mr.Draconian, post:3, topic:550431”]Lol no need for deleting them noob,and how is he supposed to code with the java files after he deleted them lol[/quote]Decompile the .class files is one way to go.</p>
<p>On Topic:<br>
Download Eclipse, set up your client as a project, and then jar the project with “client” as your main class.</p>
