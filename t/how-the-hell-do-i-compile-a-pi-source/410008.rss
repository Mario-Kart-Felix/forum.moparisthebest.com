    <title>How the hell do i compile a [pi] source?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-the-hell-do-i-compile-a-pi-source/410008</link>
    <description>Okay so im trying to compile my pi source to change the name of the source i changed it to my custom name and i compile in the main fodle3r where src and bin and data are and get no errors. i then run the server and nothing has changed. if you could see whats happening over team viewer or just tell me the proper way to compile please let me know.

p.s i already have a post about this but i thought that this problem may just be because i am not compiling right,  thanks!</description>
