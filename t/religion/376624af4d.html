Yes, because apparently a huge explosion that started in a piece of matter smaller than my thumb created this universe.</p>
<p>Haven’t you noticed scientists really LOVE explosions? I have yet to see a theory of how the universe/solar system was created without an explosion being there to prove their theory.</p>
<p>Face it, both science and religion have illogical points. That’s where your belief comes into play; each person has his own beliefs, and nobody can change those beliefs unless the person is completely convinced.</p>

<p>Well.<br>
How can you explain one thing?:<br>
Judaism wasn’t even created until nearly 3,000 B.C.<br>
Christianity/Catholicism wasn’t even created until ~30 B.C.<br>
If we follow the Bible, Adam and Eve should have been Jews themselves.<br>
Following history, the creation of this planet was ~60 Billion years ago.<br>
In the Bible, God creates Earth and puts Adam and Eve on Earth.<br>
How do you explain the 59,999,997,000 years of delay for the creation of the religion?</p>
<p>Another point:<br>
The universe is ever-expanding. If God did create us, he would have created others as well.<br>
Observing how much of the universe exists currently (meaning currently visible), it would be highly unlikely that we are the first self-superior race to exist.<br>
If another race is superior to us, or is similar to us and has aged more, I have another point:<br>
Considering how we have 25% of the visible universe mapped (This is a FACT. I attended a presentation of Astronomy in Boulder, with a professor who is working with NASA and is currently using the Hubble Satellite. He is the Director at the Boulder University Department of Astronomy), another race should have more of the universe mapped.<br>
After considering that, you would think they would have enough technology to reach us.<br>
Seeing as we have no proof of any extra-terrestrial existence, I myself do not believe in the religions of Judaism, Christianity, or Catholicism.<br>
If extra-terrestrials to exist, we may or may not find out.</p>
<p>One last point against religion:<br>
Seeing as we have 25% of the currently visible universe mapped (3D X/Y/Z axis),  we would have visibly noticed any traveling machines or “ships” of any sort within the radius we have mapped.<br>
If no ships are within that radius, we have no proof of extra-terrestrial existence.<br>
If any other race did exist, they knew we were here and they did want to confront us, they would be traveling here.<br>
Which leaves us with… Absolutely no evidence of any sort.<br>
One point against what I said above:<br>
Scientific theory: If you travel above the speed of light, you should not be visible from any distance, angle, or location. In a black hole, it is theorized that you would freeze in one certain location.<br>
One point against that point right there^^:<br>
Black hole theory: If any extra-terrestrial machines or “ships” were traveling here, the odds are that they would encounter a black hole (still unproven to exist). If they did encounter such a devilish natural and spacial disaster, they would be frozen in time to our vision. That would make it even more noticeable if an extra-terrestrial machine or “ship” was heading for us.</p>
<p>From all of what I have said so far, I must conclude:<br>
Science goes against religion and (visible) extra-terrestrial existence. Religion stays neutral with extra-terrestrial existence.<br>
Science is far more easily perceivable to the human mind, or any mind we have knowledge of existing.<br>
Therefore, it is logical for anyone to believe in Science more than Religion.</p>
<p>Note: This is all about Science being correct. I would make another long post about Religion “being correct” that would also be flamed, but I am stating what I personally believe. Therefore, I’d rather not try.</p>
<p>If you actually read all of this post, I respect you.</p>

<p>As for other planets existing… A few days ago i saw a national geographic video stating they found a planet that is made of umm… idk how to say it in english but gas and fuel and stuff, it even rains that.

<p>Well.<br>
How can you explain one thing?:<br>
Judaism wasn’t even created until nearly 3,000 B.C.<br>
Christianity/Catholicism wasn’t even created until ~30 B.C.<br>
If we follow the Bible, Adam and Eve should have been Jews themselves.<br>
Following history, the creation of this planet was ~60 Billion years ago.<br>
In the Bible, God creates Earth and puts Adam and Eve on Earth.<br>
How do you explain the 59,999,997,000 years of delay for the creation of the religion?</p>
<p>Another point:<br>
The universe is ever-expanding. If God did create us, he would have created others as well.<br>
Observing how much of the universe exists currently (meaning currently visible), it would be highly unlikely that we are the first self-superior race to exist.<br>
If another race is superior to us, or is similar to us and has aged more, I have another point:<br>
Considering how we have 25% of the visible universe mapped (This is a FACT. I attended a presentation of Astronomy in Boulder, with a professor who is working with NASA and is currently using the Hubble Satellite. He is the Director at the Boulder University Department of Astronomy), another race should have more of the universe mapped.<br>
After considering that, you would think they would have enough technology to reach us.<br>
Seeing as we have no proof of any extra-terrestrial existence, I myself do not believe in the religions of Judaism, Christianity, or Catholicism.<br>
If extra-terrestrials to exist, we may or may not find out.</p>
<p>One last point against religion:<br>
Seeing as we have 25% of the currently visible universe mapped (3D X/Y/Z axis),  we would have visibly noticed any traveling machines or “ships” of any sort within the radius we have mapped.<br>
If no ships are within that radius, we have no proof of extra-terrestrial existence.<br>
If any other race did exist, they knew we were here and they did want to confront us, they would be traveling here.<br>
Which leaves us with… Absolutely no evidence of any sort.<br>
One point against what I said above:<br>
Scientific theory: If you travel above the speed of light, you should not be visible from any distance, angle, or location. In a black hole, it is theorized that you would freeze in one certain location.<br>
One point against that point right there^^:<br>
Black hole theory: If any extra-terrestrial machines or “ships” were traveling here, the odds are that they would encounter a black hole (still unproven to exist). If they did encounter such a devilish natural and spacial disaster, they would be frozen in time to our vision. That would make it even more noticeable if an extra-terrestrial machine or “ship” was heading for us.</p>
<p>From all of what I have said so far, I must conclude:<br>
Science goes against religion and (visible) extra-terrestrial existence. Religion stays neutral with extra-terrestrial existence.<br>
Science is far more easily perceivable to the human mind, or any mind we have knowledge of existing.<br>
Therefore, it is logical for anyone to believe in Science more than Religion.</p>
<p>Note: This is all about Science being correct. I would make another long post about Religion “being correct” that would also be flamed, but I am stating what I personally believe. Therefore, I’d rather not try.</p>
<p>If you actually read all of this post, I respect you.[/quote]</p>
<p>What does the visibility of the universe have to do with religion?</p>

</aside>
<p>I have studied multiple other religions. Honestly, every one of the other religions I have studied are less believable than a toddler lying (not meant to be an insult, just an analogy).<br>
Mormonism: Every religiously significant point in Mormonism’s history is unproven. In other religions, they usually have at least some historical proof found by Archaeologists or Scientists of some sort.<br>
Islam: I’m in the process of studying this religion in school. So far, it is nearly as believable or historically proven as Christianity or the other popular religions. Personally, I feel it is incorrect because so few people follow it and the only people I’ve known to follow it live less than comfortable lives. This is just personal belief, so I have no proof against Islam.<br>
Buddhism: This is actually a religion that believes in religious freedom and is open to other beliefs, so I am a personal fan of Buddhism. I won’t state any proof with or against it, because there is far too much to study on such a religion.</p>
<p>Any other religion, I have not studied yet. I don’t see a reason why they would be more believable, as even the most popular religions are unproven.</p>

[/quote]<br>
Kind of don’t understand that… mind explaining?[/quote]<br>
Of course, I don’t mind.</p>
<p>As I posted a few posts ago, we have 25% of the visible universe mapped. That may seem like a small amount to you, but our galaxy (the Milky Way) is less than one quadrillionth of what we visibly see.<br>
For analogy/ratio purposes, picture this:<br>
If the Milky Way was 150 meters in radius…<br>
The solar system is 150/144,000,000 or 0.001 millimeters in radius or 1 micron.<br>
This makes it incredibly hard to believe that we are the only life existing.<br>
We have no proof that we are or are not the only life-forms currently existing in the universe.<br>
Doing the math. our Solar System is 1/1,500,000 of the Milky Way.<br>
Multiply the denominator by 1,000,000,000,000,000…<br>
The answer is: 1,500,000,000,000,000,000,000.<br>
Our Solar System ~1/1,500,000,000,000,000,000,000 of the visible universe (the ~ sign is because some measurements are likely incorrect, and the universe is ever-expanding).<br>
Considering that ratio, you can conclude that it is HIGHLY unlikely that we are the only living life-forms to exist.<br>
Science can depict extra-terrestrial existence, yet religion cannot and never will be able to.<br>
If you know what I’m getting at, Science becomes slightly more believable and provable every day that our technology increases, and never once has a slight bit of religion been proven.<br>
Sure, it’s in history. History has been altered. Majorly or minorly, we are completely unaware of the extent to which it has been altered.<br>
Science cannot be tampered with. Yet it continues to become more and more believable and proven every day.</p>
<p>I conclude that: No matter how long the world-wide debate of Religion vs. Science continues, Science will be come more and more believable and it will eventually prevail.<br>
We may never know the answer. The sun could explode before we have nearly enough information to conclude a scientifically, historically or religiously proven answer.</p>
<p>We have no proven answer. It is personal belief. I personally believe that Science is more believable and will prevail in the end, no matter how long it takes.</p>

<p>I hate people who tell me god created everything, I ask them something they dont expect. “If god created everything why did he create war?” Usually they say Humans created it to make a balance between good and bad. I end the conversation with “Why did god create bad? You wouldnt need a balance if there was no bad would you?”<br>
[/quote]To easy to answer your little 5 year old pathetic questions. I know far to much even though I can still be 13.</p>
<p>If god created everything why did he create war?: Way to easy. If there wasn’t war, there would be an inbalance in the Earth. Ever wondered how the Earth is perfect and has all that humans need? God knew that we would be using fossil fuels so much, that’s why he created all of these dinosaurs. For them to die, for the fossils, for the fuel! No war, things would never of have changed. Maybe there was a nation or tribe he needed to get rid of.</p>
<p>Why did god create bad?: If all was good, then there would be nothing for good to fight against. For example. If everyone had a million dollars, the people who create these kinds of foods like cereals will stop their business. You know why? Becuz they do it for money and now they have a million dollars. Now if there were people who were poor, then those people would be the ones doing the jobs.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t need a balance if there was no bad: If everything is good, what’s the point for living? Kill yourself, VY Canis Majoris (the largest know star, 8.8 billion times larger than the sun) won’t give a shit.</p>

Judaism wasn’t even created until nearly 3,000 B.C.<br>

<p>Another point:<br>
The universe is ever-expanding. If God did create us, he would have created others as well.<br>
Observing how much of the universe exists currently (meaning currently visible), it would be highly unlikely that we are the first self-superior race to exist.<br>

Seeing as we have no proof of any extra-terrestrial existence, I myself do not believe in the religions of Judaism, Christianity, or Catholicism.<br>
If extra-terrestrials to exist, we may or may not find out.</p>
<p>One last point against religion:<br>
Seeing as we have 25% of the currently visible universe mapped (3D X/Y/Z axis),  we would have visibly noticed any traveling machines or “ships” of any sort within the radius we have mapped.<br>
If no ships are within that radius, we have no proof of extra-terrestrial existence.<br>
If any other race did exist, they knew we were here and they did want to confront us, they would be traveling here.<br>
Which leaves us with… Absolutely no evidence of any sort.<br>
One point against what I said above:<br>
Scientific theory: If you travel above the speed of light, you should not be visible from any distance, angle, or location. In a black hole, it is theorized that you would freeze in one certain location.<br>
One point against that point right there^^:<br>
Black hole theory: If any extra-terrestrial machines or “ships” were traveling here, the odds are that they would encounter a black hole (still unproven to exist). If they did encounter such a devilish natural and spacial disaster, they would be frozen in time to our vision. That would make it even more noticeable if an extra-terrestrial machine or “ship” was heading for us.</p>
<p>From all of what I have said so far, I must conclude:<br>
Science goes against religion and (visible) extra-terrestrial existence. Religion stays neutral with extra-terrestrial existence.<br>
Science is far more easily perceivable to the human mind, or any mind we have knowledge of existing.<br>
Therefore, it is logical for anyone to believe in Science more than Religion.</p>
<p>Note: This is all about Science being correct. I would make another long post about Religion “being correct” that would also be flamed, but I am stating what I personally believe. Therefore, I’d rather not try.</p>
<p>If you actually read all of this post, I respect you.[/quote]Atheism is defined as a lack of belief in a supernatural being, creator, or deity. Briefly, it is a lack of belief in God.</p>
<p>It is one of the major opponents of the Christian Church and Christian beliefs. It has always been diretly related to materialism. Summed up, the more materialistic a society is, the less spiritual it becomes. The less spiritual it becomes, the stronger atheism affects that society.</p>
<p>Therefore, the more materialistic a society becomes, the more atheism strengthens over it.</p>
<p>Atheism relies mostly on logic, analysis, and science. They do not believe in faith, nor the miracles of the Bible.</p>
<p>Atheism, though has major flaws. At first glance, it seems atheism has a strong, irrefutable, non-debatable position. Like so many things in this world, it looks good only on the outside, but actually is weak on the inside - a foundation built on sand.</p>
<p>Atheism has three major flaws:</p>
<p>Atheist Statement No. 1 - “Atheism declares it does not believe in faith, that science is the way to truth because it does not rely on faith unlike religion. Science does not rely on faith and therefore cannot be biased.”</p>
<p>Christian answer: Even in science, we still need a certain degree of faith in scientists and researchers since we ourselves cannot possibly verify all their findings to prove that what they are saying is true.</p>
<p>Unless you can verify scientists’ findings one by one for yourself, you will have to accept their “word” at face value. You will have to believe that what they’re saying is true. You will have to have “faith” in their words.</p>
<p>Look. In the past, we’ve had “scientific errors” committed by scientists. Errors such as scientific facts that were declared as truth but were later found out to be false or in doubt.</p>
<p>Among numerous examples, one example is found in medical science. For many years, scientists/researchers have always declared that damage to the human spinal cord was permanent and irreversible. This was a scientific fact, established as the truth before.</p>
<p>However, only recently, this previous scientific fact was proven to be, well, untrue. Modern findings have proven that the human spinal cord does regenerate, albeit, in a very slow manner. A lot of people with damaged spinal cords have been able to walk, much against the declaration of their doctors that all hope was lost.</p>
<p>That science is not based on faith is totally false. Therefore, this refutes the first statement of atheism.</p>
<p>As St. Francis of Assisi wisely said “Faith is higher than reason. Reason is useless… unless you believe.”</p>
<p>Atheist Statement No. 2 - "Science is based only on purely objective facts, while religion is partially subjective and therefore cannot be purely objective. "</p>
<p>Christian answer: Science relies on objectivity, and needs to utilize a method called the “scientific method”. The scientific method relies on observation, experimentation, data-gathering, etc.</p>
<p>Once science loses its objectivity, or becomes partially subjective, it loses its credibility as a discipline.</p>
<p>Therein lies the problem. The scientific method does provide purely objective data, BUT scientists still have to "interpret them. Since scientists are only human, the interpretation of the data becomes mixed with personal opinions and become “partially subjective”. This cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>Scientists are human beings with different beliefs, religions, philosophies, and come from various countries and cultures throughout the globe.</p>
<p>Take for example the debate on the origin of the universe. This major debate has been going on for centuries, and has divided the scientific community into “creationist scientists” and “evolutionist scientists”.</p>
<p>The creationist scientists believe that the universe has order, design, and was created by an intelligent, omnpiotent being, a god. God is the creator of the universe.</p>
<p>The evolutionist scientists believe otherwise. They state that the universe has no design, has no order and is random. They reject the idea of a god, a creator of our universe.</p>
<p>And it doesn’t even matter who has more numbers on either side. The truth is never based on “majority wins”.</p>
<p>Say for example, my friend and I hid a silver coin inside a box. Now, we make a survey and ask all people around the world if they believe a coin exists in the box or not.</p>
<p>Even if all people around the world said they don’t believe a coin exists in the box, the truth is not affected by their numbers. My friend and I know the truth that a coin does exist because we hid it ourselves! So truth is not based on majority opinion.</p>
<p>Atheist statement number 2 is therefore false.</p>
<p>Atheist Statement No. 3) “Science is better than religion because it relies on an objective method - the scientific method. This method produces truth because it is based on objective data, experimentations, logic, etc. Religion does not use an objective method and is based on opinion, speculation, etc. It lacks “scientific proof”, on “miracles” in the Holy Bible.”</p>
<p>Christian answer: Science does rely on an objective method, but by what authority does the “scientific method” produce truth? By what authority does science possess when it says we must believe science because it utilizes the “scientific method”?</p>
<p>I mean you cannot state that science is an authority of truth simpy because it uses the scientific method. It’s like saying “I therefore conclude that science produces truth because it uses the scientific method.”</p>
<p>By what authority?</p>
<p>How will you prove using the scientific method does produce truth? Because it’s “scientific”? Because science said so? Again, the question “By what authority does science have by proclaiming to be the truth than religion”?</p>
<p>The statement “The results of the scientific method should be followed” is unscientific because it is a value statement that does not get its authority from anywhere but itself.</p>
<p>“We should use the scientific method.” Why should we? “It proves itself.” How does it prove itself? “It uses the scientific method.”</p>
<p>Atheist Statement: “The scientific method is true because it works and because it is axiomatic (self-evident).”</p>
<p>Christian answer: Sounds a lot like faith to me. Who decides what is axiomatic? does the scientific method decide it? That makes it circular if it does. If not, then it is not scientific itself.</p>
<p>I would have to do all the experiments to come to that conclusion. Other than that, I take it on faith that all of the scientists who did the experiments and reviewed them and tested them are not lying to me. That is my point.</p>
<p>You cannot use the “scientific method” as a reason to make science as an authority of truth, simply because the only way to prove science as the truth is to use the “scientific method”! The logic is circular.</p>
<p>And yes, the miracles in the Bible have been verified by both atheist (for objectivity) and theist (God-believing) scientists as true historical events. Events such as the Exodus from Egypt, David slaying Goliath, parting of the Red Sea, etc. were tested and researched using modern scientific methods. Watch “Secrets of the Bible” at Cable TV’s “Discovery Channel”.</p>
<p>At a different cable channel, underwater cameras showed pictures of ancient relics -particularly a large “chariot wheel” deep beneath the Red Sea. When traced back, the design of the wheel was identical to the chariots used in Egypt at around the time Moses’ parting of the Red Sea occurred!</p>
<p>God has been so gracious as to provide solid, irrefutable evidence to believers and non-believers alike.</p>
<p>Atheist statement number 3 is therefore false.</p>

        <p>By the way, who ever noticed that all good athiest scientist turned christian or so? That’s because science doesn’t go as far as religion does. I am Muslim, I know a lot that can explain why I am with Islam, but I doubt anyone would read all of it.<br>
Now, every dinosaur died because god only created enough animals for the fossil fuels we need. If he created one more, then it would be useless. It would just be an extra fossil. We have as many as we need.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>The size of the universe is not imaginable by the human mind. It expands faster than the speed of light.<br>
Let’s play the size game, where we find how large things are.</p>
<p>We live in the Earth.<br>
The Earth has around 6-7 billion humans<br>
The Earth is one of the eight planets in our solar system.<br>
The Sun manages our solar system.<br>
The Sun is a medium sized star.<br>
The Sun is 1.3 million times larger than Earth.<br>
The Solar System contains eight planets and one Sun.<br>
The Solar System is in a galaxy called the Milky Way<br>
The Milky Way consists of many other systems.<br>
The Milky Way is one of the billions and trillions of galaxys.<br>
The Universe is growing with galaxys as you read this.<br>
And back to us, how large are we?</p>
<p>So if you get a D- or A+ on your math test or so, don’t be afraid. Because we aren’t even 1/1000000000000th of a pixel when we look at an image of the universe itself. And if we die, we are only the 6-7 billions of humans that will all die at some point.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to learn why I am with Islam, go to <a href="http://www.harunyahya.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.HarunYahya.com</a> where this magnificent scientist explains miracles mixed with Islamic proof and explains Islam mixed with scientific proof.</p>

<p>Faith means making a virtue out of not thinking. It’s nothing to brag about. And those who preach faith, and enable and elevate it are intellectual slaveholders, keeping mankind in a bondage to fantasy and nonsense that has spawned and justified so much lunacy and destruction. Religion is dangerous because it allows human beings who don’t have all the answers to think that they do. Most people would think it’s wonderful when someone says, “I’m willing, Lord! I’ll do whatever you want me to do!” Except that since there are no gods actually talking to us, that void is filled in by people with their own corruptions and limitations and agendas. And anyone who tells you they know, they just know what happens when you die, I promise you, you don’t. How can I be so sure? Because I don’t know, and you do not possess mental powers that I do not. The only appropriate attitude for man to have about the big questions is not the arrogant certitude that is the hallmark of religion, but doubt. Doubt is humble, and that’s what man needs to be, considering that human history is just a litany of getting shit dead wrong. This is why rational people, anti-religionists, must end their timidity and come out of the closet and assert themselves. And those who consider themselves only moderately religious really need to look in the mirror and realize that the solace and comfort that religion brings you actually comes at a terrible price. If you belonged to a political party or a social club that was tied to as much bigotry, misogyny, homophobia, violence, and sheer ignorance as religion is, you’d resign in protest. To do otherwise is to be an enabler, a mafia wife, for the true devils of extremism that draw their legitimacy from the billions of their fellow travelers. If the world does come to an end here, or wherever, or if it limps into the future, decimated by the effects of religion-inspired nuclear terrorism, let’s remember what the real problem was that we learned how to precipitate mass death before we got past the neurological disorder of wishing for it. That’s it. Grow up or die. </p>

I didn’t say anything about science, now did I?</p>
<p>And “theories are just ideas”, is exactly what was addressed in the quote I posted. Saying that you don’t know all the answers to life (doubt) is humble, and does not start wars.</p>
<p>Before you respond to my posts I suggest you actually understand them.</p>
