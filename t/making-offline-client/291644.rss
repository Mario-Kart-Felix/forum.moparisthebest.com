    <description>Alright so I already posted help on the forums got no help now I want to make it offline I made a server offline before but not a fully customized client made by me.  !.  I never got to fully run the client like log in because no one bothers to help me on how to get my server connected and yes I read the forums.  2 I made an IP adress and all that so right now I give up and what to make it offline.  How do I do that.  Because it always ask me for like IP and I&#39;m sick of that I just want to play by myslef.</description>
