    <description>I didn&#39;t want to make 3 different threads for each thread so I posted in 1

1.)I wanted to know how you make restricted area or something like that, if you walk there you get a message like you aren&#39;t level 99 yet.
2.)in a pi server i was working on, I made the dialogue and everything but when I click talk to nothing happens
3.)also I wondering how do you open things in in the quest tab for example in the quest tab it says staff list you click it then a interface or whatever opens..how would I do that?</description>

              <ol>
<li>
<p>In player.java create a boolean that checks if the player is in specific coords, if they are it returns true, if not, it returns false. There are a million tuts on this specifically. From there you’d want to make a check in  Walking.java (since that’s the packet that handles walking) that if they are in said area and do not have the reqs, it will remove them or what ever you wish, if they do have the reqs, it’d do nothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you added the proper code to ActionHandler.java for first/second click on npc or what ever you’re using, show code so I can actually see your problem, this includes your dialogues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ClickingButtons.java is what you want to be looking in. Make sure your server sends debug information when you click on a button (this isn’t hard to enable). Then use that ID as a new case, and add your code in there.</p>
