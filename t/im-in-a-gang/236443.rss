    <title>I&#39;m in a gang</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-in-a-gang/236443</link>
    <description>
Called Fresh University at my school. More of a clique than a gang though.

Here&#39;s how it went down. I got four books for college this semester.
One of them is for my History Of Special Effects class. From the first special effects to the effects of 2007 in a HUGE ass book that looks sweet as hell. Explains everything almost. I really like this book. 75$

One of them is my geometry book. It&#39;s about a quarter of the size of the special effects book, but still 500 pages. 500 pages of words and triangles. 120$

Bullshit. Almost double price for that? Hell no. I thought it was a load of shit. So, after spending 350$ total on book, I got an idea looking at the receipt. All books can be turned in within a week in original condition with the receipt for full refund.

Here&#39;s how it goes. I said I was going to go home, and take a picture of each page in the book and put them on my computer, and then bring the book back for a refund. Then I offered to do it to others&#39;.

One of them came up to me and was like damn you sure is a hustler and told me I could be in their clique cause they need someone to handle money and shiz.

So basically, I&#39;m selling the geometry book in it&#39;s entirety for 20$ via internet, or 50$ if they want it printed out. They save anywhere from 100$ to 70$ and I make it.

I just finished getting all the pictures of every page, took about twenty minutes with a few breaks.</description>

You can’t accurately generalize all private schools/their students like that, they vary greatly.<br>
Of course, the same thing goes for public schools/pretty much anything.</p>

I once knew a kid [he wasn’t always home schooled] who went to the same camp as me for about 2 weeks. A different kid was punched in the face [he hit a grill on his way down, and got knocked out]. So, the crazy kid started CRYING. In between sobs, he yelled “I LIVE IN A SHELTERED ENVIRONMENT! I’VE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE GET PUNCHED BEFORE!”.<br>
I have to admit, due to him and a few other crazies, that was the best camp I’ve ever been too. [George Bush was there. He told us to join the army.]</p>

Not always. A lot of students are on scholarships, or can barely afford the tuition [at my school]. You’re right, but it’s not as bad/noticeable as you would think. The expectation part really changes from person to person, though.</p>

<p>Okay I kinda already explained it’s not a gang. It’s more of a clique. And the gang has nothing to do with the books. I’ll sell some of them some books. But that’s not the purpose of it. If they ever need anything done with money I’m their man.</p>
<p>The books is my own thing.</p>
