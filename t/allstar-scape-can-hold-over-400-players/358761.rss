Was bored, can hold over 400 players apparently.

&lt;blockquote&gt;YOU CAN&#39;T POST THIS, IT&#39;S NOT YOURS! [b]MEH MEH MEH![/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allstar-Scape V1

[b]Information[/b]
Well I&#39;ve [i]rerere[/i]registered on these forums countless
times, so don&#39;t post things about me not knowing what I&#39;m
talking about, anyone can get this information if they really
want to anyways so does it matter really?

This was the Project Insanity/Deltascape two or so years ago,
when the server status page was actually full of servers built
by this base &amp; majority of them were leeched, knowing this we
still played them because even knowing this, we knew that
it would be fun. Not some stupid little PvP server that
makes you pay for all the decent items &amp; areas. I guess I&#39;m just
a sucker for nostalgia. Irrelevant note, this was around the
time of [url=http://www.easy-share.com/1910238821/Silabsoft.zip]The Silabsoft Client[/url], not the worst client nowadays.

[quote=&quot;JlStepper&quot;][b] This server will crash with 10 players online. [/b][/quote]
Small video I made, can have over 30 players doing things without lag.

<p>Thank you for replying, the only of which that has information to backup said statements. The information given about winterLove was already known to me but thank you for informing others that are clearly not as intellectual. Obviously I didn’t make this clear, <span class="bbcode-b">my videos had only shown players online the server, I never said that this is what this can do normally, I did in fact say that the server should hold up to 30 players without to much issues within the <span class="bbcode-i">AllStar-Scape Stability</span> video as a caption.</span> I apologize if I confused anyone, I did fight some replies but that’s because they were unfounded and idiotic. I have no other responses, thank you for a decent reply. I do enjoy your cleaned sources so I do have a respect for you.</p>

              <p>Alright. Break it down.</p>
<p>I am fed up with you incompetent fucktards talking the shit that is being said on this thread.</p>
<p>1: As Three One Seven said Czar came before Deltascape. In reality most servers including both Czar and Deltascape are based off of Winterlove(The first private server).</p>
<p>Some info about Winterlove:<br>
Winterlove was originally written to show that private servers could be made and it was not intended to be used as it is.<br>
Thus! Winterlove’s core is quite unstable and it is very inefficient.<br>
Since then, some attempts have been made to improve Winterlove but what really needs to be done is the Hyperion approach. (Completely start from scratch)<br>
This of course is impractical as the majority of the people doing private servers are just here for some entertainment over the holidays and not really here to learn Java/create something of worth.<br>
There are about 10 people on this website with <span class="bbcode-b">actual</span> Java knowledge. (I do not claim to be one before anyone starts flaming me about it)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Players connecting via local-host or not does in fact make a big difference. If the players are connected via local-host data transfer from client to server is instant. This means that any lag which could cause bugs in the server is lessened and thus less effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most I have ever seen an All-star server host (On a pretty pro comp too) with all the players being real, not over local-host and doing activities is about 30 - 50.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deltascape and the servers after it were all based on a more modified Winterlove which had improved stability and which is why they can handle &gt;100 real players.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, I would like to make it clear, I love All-Star I think it is great fun to play etc. <span class="bbcode-b">BUT</span> I do not think that it is a good base for anyone who is serious about learning to code and having a good server. Sure it is fine for summerfags and the like. But if you really want to create a good server use Hyperion or one of the stickied servers.</p>
<p>If you cannot work them out I recommend Battlescape. (Cleaned of course).</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, on a personal note:</p>
<p>[quote=“imsokool22, post:46, topic:358761”]ok i just got 1 ? for you.<br>
Q:is allstar delta?</p>
<p>only holy can answer this. answer and ill block you.[/quote]</p>
<p>This is just one of the immensely retarded things I have seen you spout. I want you to leave this website and then throw yourself off your balcony/banister or jump from a chandelier with a rope tied around your neck.</p>
<p>You are never going to get anywhere in life with intense ignorance and stupidity.</p>

<p>This simply meant it was as famous and over used as PI &amp; Deltascape. <span class="bbcode-b">It was not made off of the Deltascape source released by delta_</span>. Project Czar was first and believe me this source was made off of Czar. Deltascape came after, you don’t back up your statements at all and should be muted for your idiocy.</p>

I Guess you need to learn how to spell too.<br>
Lets not turn this into a flame war and cause the topic to be closed (which i am sure is what a few of you are aiming for) Allstar isn’t very well protected against cheat clients, and last time i checked there were still quite a few dupes =P</p>
