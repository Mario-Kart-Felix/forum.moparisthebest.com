    <description>this is probly one of my most unanswerd and longest going question in my head..

well i was in the tutorials section because i was bored and i found a tutorial that  showed a couple pictures that got into my head..
you know how when you download a source and you get a file thats books stacked and you extract and you get another file with client and everything in it. well that second folder i saw was cald &quot;moparscape&quot; it looked just like a server source folder and i was stuned because when i first started mopar i asked were client java was and eveyrone added it to there sig :P, well anyway that second folder i never got..only one closest to that was &quot;hybridscape&quot;..so if you have any suggestions and if you know what im asking here please tell me...

oh and im not a noob, i just didnt mess with this and went on and got a sources and coded blah blah blah and now its in advertizements..

so please help me with this ongoing question..if you dont know what the folder im talking about is.. here..
