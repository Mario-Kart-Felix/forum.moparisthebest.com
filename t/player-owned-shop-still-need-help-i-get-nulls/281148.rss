    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-owned-shop-still-need-help-i-get-nulls/281148</link>
    <description>Hey guys, im making this shop, nothing to buy (regents and stuff) But players can sell to it, and buy stuff. It sounds simple but im struggling!!

Ive got it all write, you can see the shop and trade with it, but when i sell something, it says you can&#39;t sell to this shop!?

WTF!?

This is my shop.cfg file.
[code]
//--ShopID---ShopName--------------------------------------Sell----Buy-----Item----Amount
shop = 65 Player Store				             30	   30
[/code]

I can now sell stuff to shop, when i sell noted stuff it&#39;s a null? Help Please</description>

Well silabs crashes on startup, like try webber’s client.<br>
Also crashes… Time to delete profile…</p>
<p>Also nulls… Oh well…</p>
<p>Ok, JC, how would i make it so you can only sell un-noted things to the shop? If you did try and sell noted stuff the this shop it says “You can’t sell noted items to this shop”</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
