    <description> :mad: the test scape errors:
For the npc that needs a rod and bait/feather they dont work i have my rod and bait/feathers at the slot 1 but it doesnt do nothing.
Testcape admin said the ecto-plasm is replaced as bloods but it dont work :eek:
The runecrafting teleport doesnt work
The fishing needs work
The herblore doesnt work
Slayer doesnt work
And if you use a staff to teleport it doesnt work
Thier are no npc that sells soul,blood, and god staffs
The cooking doesnt work :confused:

                                           server download help

I downloaded all the servers but the only one that works is testscape. I edited the compile and run bats but it still doesnt work. I extracted to desktop. But when I try to open it it keeps saying javac cannot recognize or cannot find the location of the program
