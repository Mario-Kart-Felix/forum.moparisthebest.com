    <title>[317] Creating Commands</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-creating-commands/373500</link>
    <description>[b]Purpose: To create a command for people to use[/b]
[b]Difficulty: 2/10[/b]
[b]Knowledge Required: Copy &amp; Paste[/b]
[b]Files Modified: Client.Java[/b]
[b]Credits: 100% Me[/b]

[b]Step 1: Finding where to add new commands.[/b]

Search for:
[code]if(command.startsWith(&quot;[/code] This will bring you to a big list of several commands that are already in the server.
After the end of a command press enter.

[b]Step 2: Creating a new command.[/b]

Next copy the top line of a command. E.g:
[code]if(command.startsWith(&quot;commandname&quot;)){[/code]
Where it says &quot;commandname&quot; you can rename it to anything you want people to type. E.g:
[code]if(command.startsWith(&quot;command&quot;)){[/code]
This means when someone types ::command it will activate the command doing whatever you put into the body of it.

[b]Step 3: Adding custom parts to commands[/b]

If you want to add player rights to a command so that mods and admins can use it use the code below.
[code]if(command.startsWith(&quot;commandname&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 1){[/code] The player rights are: Mod = 1, Admin = 2, Owner = 3, Hidden = 4.

If you want to add a message to the command to it tells a player they have done something. You must add this code to the body of the command.
If you are using delta use this code.
[code]sM(&quot;Congratulations you made a command!&quot;);[/code] Or if you are devolution or dodian use this code.
[code]sendMessage(&quot;Congratulations you made a command!&quot;);[/code]

You can also make it so that if someone types a command it yells to everyone else that they have typed it.
[code]yell(&quot; &quot;+playerName+&quot; &quot;);[/code]

You can also make commands give people xp in their skills by using this code in the body section of the command.
addSkillXP(XPamount, skillID); E.g:
[code]addSkillXP(13500000, 6);[/code] This gives whoever types the command 99 magic.

Aswell as adding xp you can also add items by using the code below:
[code]addItem(995, 1000000);//this gives 1m gold[/code] 995 = itemID and 1000000 = amount

You could even make a command teleport someone to a different place.
Dodian base code:
[code]toX = 0000;
toY = 0000;[/code] Delta base code: [code]triggerTele(Xcoord, Ycoord, 0);[/code] Devo base code:[code] teleportToX = 0000;
teleportToY = 0000;[/code]

[b]Step 4: Finishing off the command.[/b]

Once you have done everything above you can add the parts you want together. E.g:
[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;rares&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 2) {//admin command
addItem(1050, 1);//santa hat
addItem(1053, 1);//green h&#39;ween mask
addItem(1055, 1);//blue h&#39;ween mask
addItem(1057, 1);//red h&#39;ween mask
sM(&quot;You recieve a bunch of rare items&quot;);[/code]
But that isn&#39;t the end of the code because you need to close the command off.
You finish it off by adding } at the end of the command. E.g:
[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;rares&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt; 2) {//admin command
addItem(1050, 1);//santa hat
addItem(1053, 1);//green h&#39;ween mask
addItem(1055, 1);//blue h&#39;ween mask
addItem(1057, 1);//red h&#39;ween mask
sM(&quot;You recieve a bunch of rare items&quot;);
}[/code]</description>
