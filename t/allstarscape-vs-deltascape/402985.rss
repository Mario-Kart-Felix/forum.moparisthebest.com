    <description>I have an Allstar server that I feel is quite creative and fun to play...but I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s the best quality type of server.


What I would like to know is what are the pros and cons of AllstarScape-based and DeltaScape-based servers.  I have an idea of the differences, but I would like to understand the coding styles and files a little better. 


Thank you,


TheCyberMan



P.S. Can Ubuntu Linux host both of these fine?</description>
