    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gt5-prolouge/194919</link>
    <description>For anyone who loves, or likes, cars, get a PS3 and get this game. It&#39;s absolutely amazing. If what is offered in GT5P is just the &quot;demo&quot; then I cannot wait to see what&#39;s coming out next year :) Graphics and realism is the best I have ever played.</description>

              <p>PD has actually said they are working on real car damage and more dynamic car physics controls. The car physics even in the Prologue is massive improvement on the older series. They have the GT TV which sony have promised on the full version there will be 40 top gear episodes released on the complete version then more and more released over the weeks/months after the GT5 release, along with the Top gear test track as a bonus in the complete version <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>PD said in this interview on the day before its release that the prologue is a demo of the graphics and the cars and to ignore everything else as that will change. Like i said PLEASE ignore the lack of damage and tuning controls since these will be added in the complete version.<br>
Pretty pathetic me defending this game but i hate it when people judge things like this on its past. PD are owned by some of the best game developers in the world and can easily make this a great game. Sure even the complete version won’t be for everyone but this is still one of the best driving simulators in the world. I hear complaints of “OMG I HAVE TO SLOW RIGHT DOWN TO TURN, STEERING IS SO HARD” yes you try driving a car that fast and you will learn that trying to turn is hard. Yes you may find controls in games like Need for speed much more fun but this is a more realistic game in terms of driving. (Forget crashing etc).</p>
