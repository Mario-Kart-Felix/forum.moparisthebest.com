    <title>First ever try at finding anti-leech, need a nudge in the right direction</title>

    <description>Heres the source im going to use http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=520653.0
The anti-leech is kinda funny at first, then it pisses you off. Ive never dealt with anti-leeches before, so im not sure where to look. I was  looking through Source\src\rs2\server\model\Client because the cmd said something about that. The anti leech gives you a random name and makes a new character file every time you log in, and doesnt save yours so its weird. Can someone experienced find it and tell me what java file to look in, or what folder its in? Or you could just tell me but thats cheating. 

OT: Does anyone find anti-leeches spooky because they do random shit? Its almost like the computers trolling you ...</description>
