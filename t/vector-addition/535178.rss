    <description>&quot;A ship floating on the ocean is hit by two waves at the same time. One wave, traveling 43 degrees N of W, exerts a force of 12822 N, while the other wave, traveling 5 degrees S of W, exerts a force of 8878 N. What is the magnitude of sum of these two forces?&quot;

I got 19900N traveling 24 degrees N of W. It said it was wrong. How? Am I doing some stupid little mistake? My work is as follows

C = 180 - 43 - 5 = 132
c = sqrt(12822^2 + 8878^2 - (2*12822*8878*cos(132))) = 19900N
B = arcsin(8878*sin132/19900) = 19 degrees
43 - 19 = 24
resultant is 19900N 24 degrees N of W</description>

You’d think any physics class would still ask for a direction lol[/quote]<br>
Yeah I’d think so too. He wasn’t mad I put a direction or anything, he was more mad it didn’t want a direction. I think it was just randomly selected physics problems he put online. He scrapped that one and put up a new one that required direction because I was helping some friends out in a skype call and they had a totally different problem haha.</p>

Not sure either. I just figured that in your first calculation or 12822* cos132 you would use 3 Sig figs as 132 only has 3. It could be more precise such as 132.43 which would be 5 sig sigs, right? I personally hate Sig figs and I feel that nobody truly cares about them the higher up you go as long as you are close. I’m sure you have been at the collegiate level of science, so do they care if you used 5 sig figs instead of 3?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yes they very much do, and as you move up the chain studying mathematics you will learn the importance of them. The difference is accuracy. They can be confusing when you first start learning them, but there is a massive difference between 132.43 and 13243. I would take a bit of time (you only need like 20 minutes dude and then it makes perfect sense) to learn about them.<br>

<p>Salman Khan is an amazing teacher, and his teaching methods are very clear and easily to follow. He’s also not like 99% of college professors, he expresses things in ways that actually make sense.[/quote]<br>
I understand how to do them I just feel it is unnecessary to get a problem wrong because you overlooked a significant figure. Like all of the problem has sig figs of 4 except one has 3 and your answer has 4 sig figs so you get it wrong. My chem teacher was so anal about sig figs is why I always express my answer with correct sig figs but I found out I actually get my answer wrong because of sig figs because of stupid things like this. Then there is the question of whether you do sig figs between parts or only at the end.</p>
<p>Anyways back to the problem…<br>
Vector A x-component = 12822(cos(137)) = -9377.4 [5 sig fig]<br>
cos(137) has only 3 sig figs so shouldn’t the answer be -9380 which would have 3 sig figs? You derived that angle by using addition and subtraction from the angle in the problem which means you go to the decimal place which is the nearest ones place, which means you had the correct sig figs for 137 but when you multiplied it would be 3 sig figs because of multiplication rule, right? And then since everything else has 3 sig figs you would get 19900 as the resultant’s magnitude. However with you method the angle should be 23.6 degrees because you used division to determine the angle whereas I used addition and subtraction. I used law of sines and got 19.3 for the inside angle of the triangle and did 43-19.3 and got 24 degrees.</p>
<p>I also agree that Salman Khan is an amazing teacher. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I’ve been using him for linear algebra and calculus and love his lectures. I just wish he had practice problems for those sections.</p>

<p>Significant figures are used according to the relevant data… The question gives angles in a maximum of 2 sig figs, so when I calculated 23.6 degrees I adjusted it too 2 sig figs (i.e 24 degrees).</p>
<p>I am not 100%, but isn’t it good convention to write angles in whole integers rather than with a decimal? I know I always have and have never been pulled up for it/all of text books do. So that’s why I say I’m not 100%, it may not be correct convention but I know I do.</p>

I personally prefer to add vectors by component, so let Vector A = 12822 @ 137 degrees (43 degrees reference angle from 180 Q2), and Vector B = 8878N @ 185 degrees.<br>
Vector A x-component = 12822(cos(137)) = -9377.4 [5 sig fig], Vector A y-component = 12822(sin(137)) = 8744.6 [5 sig fig]<br>
Vector B x-component = -8878(cos(185)) = -8844.2 [5 sig fig], Vector B y-component = -773.77 [5 sig fig]<br>
Resultant x component is then Ax + Bx = -18221.6, Resultant y component is Ay + By = 7970.83<br>
Resultant magnitude is therefore sqrt((-18221.6^2) + 7970.83^2) = 19888.7N<br>
Reference angle for resultant = tan(|Ry|/|Rx|) = 23.6 = 24 degrees.</p>
<p>Since the x component (the cosine) of the magnitude is negative, and the sine is positive, you can determine that this angle is a quadrant two angle (i.e 180 - ref angle). Therefore the resultant direction is 180-24 = 156 degrees.</p>
<p>.:. the resultant is 19888.7N @ 156 degrees [from standard position].<br>
Depending on whether or not you have to convert that direction, it’s 24 degrees north of West.<br>
[/quote]<br>
And using sig figs it would be 19900N right? With my calculations at least. I think it said it was wrong because I did sig figs and it was an online test so it said it was wrong or something. I just wanted to make sure I was correct and not doing something stupid before I asked him about it tomorrow. Thanks.[/quote]<br>
To 5 sig figs it’d be 19889.</p>
