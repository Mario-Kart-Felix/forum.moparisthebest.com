    <title>Video: Baller Baby</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/video-baller-baby/5482</link>
    <description>Well this is the newest video done by me and Galagus aka Shockberta. Well this video we did took quite along time of playing basketball. Most of you will probobly think how many trys did it take them to make all those shoots well most of them we made on our first try, but of course some of them were very hard and took quite a few tries. Also this film may suite more people than the other videos. Well enjoy this film the editing was done by Galagus, i believe he did a great job with all the effects, enjoy. 

Well just go here www.freewebs.com/peiwei/weivideos.htm and its the top one.</description>
