    <description>Hey, I&#39;v come across an AMAZING Idea for our server! I was wondering if you could help me on the way of doing it, We&#39;ve got skilling zones and we was thinking if you tele to somwhere for example Woodcutting it would put on the song &quot;Welcome to the jungle!&quot; Etc, Any idea how we can do this so it puts on the song at certain areas of the game? Feedback would be EPIC :) Thanks (Y)</description>
