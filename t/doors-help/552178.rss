<p>Dude, if you’re not going to help a person, don’t respond.</p>
<p>OP:<br>
The Doors.cfg was horribly written (I’m like 9/10 sure it was ripped from another system and converted).</p>
<p>Ths method is not much better, but in your case I think it should work…<br>

<p>He is having trouble figure something out and searches for help. and you just turn around and say that he is a “noob when it comes to programming”…<br>
Why don’t you help him instead, since this is a help section. No need to be pulling him down.<br>
If you have no time, then don’t post in the help section till you have time to be helping people, because you don’t seem to be helping him in any way.</p>
