    <title>The server has been updated to 1.5.2</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-server-has-been-updated-to-1-5-2/523377</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just finished updating the server to 1.5.2, same as usual if there are any issues please post here or message me. Finally all of our plugins and bukkit have reached a stage where we can use them. I appreciate that 1.6 is just around the corner, but while that may be the case for the Mojang release bukkit take 6 or so months to get a workable build out and then we have an array of plugins to wait for.

There is a few changes that I&#39;m still working on, for a start if you&#39;re a new player you will now spawn in another world called the spawn world or SW, this world contains a placeholder room with a few portals leading to various worlds, as it stands we have the framework added to add the other worlds once they&#39;re done transferring (This includes world1, world2) but right now the current world is fully working, and accessible. 

I&#39;m going to be looking at optimizing orebfuscator as well in the morning, but as it stands it&#39;s 3:41AM and I&#39;m calling it a night.</description>

              <p>Thanks for the list, I’ve added note to the ones I’ve fixed and the ones I’m still working on.</p>
<p>[quote=“kickingjamie, post:6, topic:523377”]2. I go through the new portal at spawn to get to the portal room, I end up on the roof with no way back in. The end result was me killing myself. - This should be fixed now<br>
3. I then fail to spawn at my usual bed at my base and instead at spawn. - This should be fixed, just set a random spawn bed and killed myself and I spawned at the bed<br>
4. I go through the nether portal at spawn to try and get to the nether hub and get teleported 20-30blocks below it and fall to my death. - There is a scaling issue with the worlds ad the coord system, there is no inherent fix I can see but for the mean time we’ve placed the appropriate blocks to stop people from dying when they enter the main nether portal<br>
6. After falling to my death I respawn in the nether at 0,0??? (not supposed to happen) - Right now there is an issue where each world has its own individual spawn point rather than one main point for branching worlds, if you don’t have a spawn point set (i.e. a bed) then you will spawn in the world you’re currently in (like the nether or the end).<br>
7. I manage to get to the portal to my base in the nether and when I go through I spawn in the middle of the sky and fall to my death. I tried multiple times with the same outcome.<br>
8. I manage to safely get to Fuscates base because water broke my fall - I would have died again if it hadn’t be there. Time to test the end.<br>
9. My enderchest once again has been reset and emptied…<br>
10. I suffocated in a wall when I went through the end portal, I died and spawn in the end…(not suppose to happen) - I’ve not been able to test this, but the end should be linked and work fine now. I can’t comment on whether it has the same issue as the nether, where the coordinate scaling is off but if that’s the case then if the spawn area for the end portal is a confined space with no room for coordinate spawning error then it can spawn you in a wall and kill you. If somebody can guide me to a natural end portal I can expand the area in creative as a temporary solution.[/quote]</p>
<p>Once all the above are confirmed I’ll look into the rest. We’re currently working on the worldmap so it probably wont work at this time. If you still have issues with beds, go ahead and resleep in your bed etc.</p>

Tom is trying to add multi-worlds which is obviously causing some issues, however if he can fix the issues you’ll be able to get onto the old world 1 and 2 as well as the current vanilla world.</p>

<li>I spawn at spawn with my inventory wiped.</li>
<li>I go through the new portal at spawn to get to the portal room, I end up on the roof with no way back in. The end result was me killing myself.</li>

<li>Well you already know about the chests… It seems chests created after a certain time have lost any protection.</li>
<li>After falling to my death I respawn in the nether at 0,0??? (not supposed to happen)</li>
<li>I manage to get to the portal to my base in the nether and when I go through I spawn in the middle of the sky and fall to my death. I tried multiple times with the same outcome.</li>

<p>Anyway, I’m so glad we finally updated.  It’s been a long time since the 1.4.7 update, and hopefully this will open up the server and community to more members.</p>
<p>EDIT- The portal at home doesn’t work.<br>
EDIT2- The portal says throught instead of through.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Another edit: I was lagging at home and I destroyed a redstone lamp and fell through the floor, and I was switching a few of the switches underneath the lamps.  As it turns out, the lamps stayed off when I logged back in after the lagging.  The redstone lamp is fine though.  Sorry about that.   <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>We don’t employ residence, we have rollback tools and chest locking plugins. If there is any issues immediately after updating with chests (which there usually is) then people can go ahead and relock them if they own them. We’re running quite an old set of databases now, so it wouldn’t surprise me if they turned around with a new database structure we don’t have one day but there is very little we can do aside from let people relock their chests, or try and restructure all our data and files to meet the new requirements.</p>
<p>I’ve always advised people to get on and check their items/work is secure after an update, and the same applies here.</p>

              <p>What plugins does this server even use? There’s no protection on anything, chests or blocks. I was really surprised I could go in anyone’s chest and break random blocks. I figured everything would be protected with bukkit being used. And no, I did not take anything or grief anyone’s creations. I put the blocks back.</p>
<p>Also, there was no one else on which I found surprising, and I don’t really want to play a public server where everyone can take my stuff even though nothing appeared to be griefed or messed up.</p>

              <p>I’ve just finished updating the server to 1.5.2, same as usual if there are any issues please post here or message me. Finally all of our plugins and bukkit have reached a stage where we can use them. I appreciate that 1.6 is just around the corner, but while that may be the case for the Mojang release bukkit take 6 or so months to get a workable build out and then we have an array of plugins to wait for.</p>
<p>There is a few changes that I’m still working on, for a start if you’re a new player you will now spawn in another world called the spawn world or SW, this world contains a placeholder room with a few portals leading to various worlds, as it stands we have the framework added to add the other worlds once they’re done transferring (This includes world1, world2) but right now the current world is fully working, and accessible.</p>
<p>I’m going to be looking at optimizing orebfuscator as well in the morning, but as it stands it’s 3:41AM and I’m calling it a night.</p>
