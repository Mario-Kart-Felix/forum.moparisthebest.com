<p>In my script, I want to search for a circle, this circle, however, can be any size, any color variation and anywhere within a set area, it’s placement is random.  The game works like so:<br>
a certain number of circles, each with numbers, are placed randomly on the board, you need to click the circles in numerical order, as fast as possible, the circles can overlap each other, piled on top, etc.  Because the color, number, placement and size is random and cannot be considered constants, the only constant property of this game is the fact that they are all circles AND the circles diminish in size as you go, Circle 1 is the largest circle, circle 2 is slightly smaller, 3 is smaller, etc.  Since shape is the only non-random property, as far as I know, using DTM’s is the only way to do this. My pseudo code is roughly as follows:<br>
repeat<br>
if (circle of size integer found)<br>
click here<br>
integer --;<br>
until (all circles clicked or integer = 0)</p>
<p>I know a little bit about DTM’s, my main question is as follows: if I supply a DTM of a circle, does SCAR automatically search for larger instances of that shape, or does it maintain solely the aspect ratio of the original dtm.  Also, since color is a random change, is it possible to make a DTM that looks for a uniformity of color without needing a color to be defined, in other words, will it look for a circle in color A, then in color B, then in color C, can something like that be done?</p>
<p>EDIT: I just realized that my pseudo code has elements of java in it as that’s my native coding language, hope it isn’t an issue.</p>

        <p>Yes, this is quite possible, there are however numerous ways of doing it.</p>
<p>The DTM Method:<br>
Involves using DDTM’s (Stands for Dynamic DTM), as you know from making a DTM you get alot of letters and symbols that SCAR turns into what you created before hand, a Dynamic DTM can be made during runtime based on variables.</p>
<p>How a DTM Works:<br>
When you made it you defined a Main Point(If you didn’t know this, It was the point you first clicked at. You might also of noticed the other points basically branch off of this point), as well as x amount of sub points.<br>
When SCAR searches for a DTM if looks for the Main Point under the conditions specified (Eg. When you made it, the options of Tolerance, Colour, Style{Box, Cross, Etc}, and Size) It basically checks for the Colour with the Tolerance in the shape of the size specified. Once it finds the mainpoints it checks if all of the subpoints are found near it. Note that all subpoints are relative to the main point. Unfortunately for you, there is no Circle search option for a point so this might be a bit hard. However, it could also be stupendously simple in that you could merely grab the middle point and change it’s tolerance to 255 (This will allow any colour to be a match) then click 4 points on the end of the circle. Now another blow to this is that DTM’s cannot be changed during runtime, Which means the distance those 4 points are from the middle of the circle can’t be changed by the script. This is where DDTM’s come in. It will mean you will need to constantly free and assign the DTM but it would not be too much of a hassle.</p>
<p>So don’t forget with DTMs:<br>
SCAR Treats each point as it’s own FindColor; Based on the style, size, colour and tolerance. It considers a match if all of the points colours are found. The points are relative to the mainpoint of the DTM. It’s basically useless to set anything but the tolerance or colour for the main point.</p>
<p>Example DTM Search: (Note this what I think SCAR is thinking while it searches)<br>
Found MainPoint Colour(166573) at (100, 100)<br>
Checking for SubPoint 1 Colour(0) in a size 5 rectangle at (80, 100) {This means that in my DTM this point was 20 to the left}<br>
Found SubPoint 1 Colour(0) at (81, 98)<br>
Checking for SubPoint 2 Colour(255) in a size 2 cross at (105, 103)<br>
Found SubPoint 2 Colour(255) at (106, 103)<br>
Found MainPoint and All Sub Points…Returning True.</p>
<p>For more information on DDTM’s consult WT-Fakawi’s DDTM Tutorial at <a href="http://villavu.com/forum" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">SRL Forums</a></p>
<p>The other method is with TPointArrays (TPAs).</p>
<p>The TPA:<br>
A TPoint is the Delphi equivalent of java.awt.Point (I hope I got the right package xD)<br>
Array you will already know.</p>
<p>The type TPointArray is a Dynamic Array of TPoints, The length can be set during runtime etc.</p>
<p>Both ways are equally complex considering you <span class="bbcode-b">will</span> need to understand DDTM’s in order to use them effectively. The TPA method is also assuming that the biggest circle will always be the one ontop (Overlapping, Front most depth)</p>
<p>FindColorsTolerance will find all the points of a colour, searching for the colour of the edge of the circle, assuming it has an outline colour (If not, this will still work, It just would of been faster if it didn’t have to find so many colours).<br>
Once you have those points you can split them up into the clusters (Ie. Into all of the little groups of points that are near eachother. If there are no overlapping circles this would literally split the TPA into the circles).<br>
Once you split them you will have a T2DPointArray, This is just an array of a TPointArray.<br>
Each entry of this 2D array is the TPA of the clusters. (Cluster[0] has all the points of the first circle, Cluster[1] has all the points of the second circle)</p>
<p>The following is said to ensure the most accurate method possible.</p>
<p>You will then have to basically find the middle point of each box and use FilterPointsPie to find the outline of the most likely circle and then click on the one with the most points remaining.</p>
<p>On a much simpler note;<br>
By simply using a TPA and searching FOR the middle colour of the circles, assuming there is an outline. You can just break it up and it should work quite well such that you can just click the biggest array.</p>
<p>Or look into FindColoredAreaTolerance in SCAR to just find the area of whatever size the circle should be.</p>
