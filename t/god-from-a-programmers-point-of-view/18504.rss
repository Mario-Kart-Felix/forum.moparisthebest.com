    <title>God, from a programmer&#39;s point of view</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/god-from-a-programmers-point-of-view/18504</link>
    <description>Sythe and I were having a great debate in IRC last night about the existance of God.  It was then I thought up what I believe to be a good argument.  I will reiterate in here for you.

Think about it this way: We are currently getting to a place in computing where AI (Artificial Intelligence) is getting to be decent.  What if at someplace, sometime someone perfected AI to actually become a conscience being? It is entirely within the realm of possibility.  

The programmer could create a self contained enviroment (ie Universe) just like unsigned java applets run in a &quot;sandbox&quot;.  This programmer could create everything, and give it rules by which to function (scientific laws of physics and the like), he could create intelligent beings with the power of free choice such as we have and just let the program advance and expand itself on its own.  

To everyone in the program, the programmer would be God, since he had always existed before anything else including the universe.  This programmer could watch as the program he set in motion functions, and if anyone make a request of him (prayer) he could decide whether or not to grant the request and what is best for each one of us.

The concept is mind boggling, and not proveable or disproveable in any way.  This is why we have faith and belief.  Whether or not there is a God will not be known by any of us 100% until we die.  Personally, I would rather believe, only to die and find out there was nothing to believe in, than to not believe, only to die and find out there was somthing to believe in all along, what about you? :)

Here I will have a Q and A, these are some questions that Sythe came up with, I will add any other valid questions that anyone else brings up too:

[b]Q:[/b]Sythe: If we are in a computer simulation then why would there be an afterlife?
[b]A:[/b]Why not? After we go through this simulation and end our life why not transfer us to another simulation? The programmer (God) has already written a set of rules that judges our choices to be wrong or right. He decides whether to transfer our programs after death to heaven or hell, each being thier own universe seperate from our own, undoubtedly with different laws governing them.

[b]Q:[/b]Sythe: I think anything capable of creating a computer powerful enough to simulate down to the sub sub sub atomic interactions of every atom in the universe wouldnt need to run any such simulation
[b]A:[/b]See, we just think that way.  For all we know, there could be no atoms. If this is a computer program, EVERYTHING we know about science or anything else only applies in here.

[b]Q:[/b]moparisthebest: How could any being or computer live or run as long as this universe has been in existance, its been billions and billions of years?
[b]A:[/b]Everything is relative. Speed is relative when you are driving a car down the road, you may be going 50mph relative to the road outside, but relative to the pencil on your dashboard you are not moving at all. Time is also relative, what may have been billions of years to us, may be only milliseconds to the computer running the program.</description>

You cherry-picked a few verses out of an entire story and then wrote your own story about it, according to the whole story it didn’t happen that way at all.  It was a war, just like we have today, and lots of people died.</p>
<p>This topic isn’t about the christian bible however, it is just stating that God could exist.<br>

Have you heard of the story in which God instructed Moses to kill everyone in a city except for virgin girls? Can you imagine that scene?</p>
<p>All of Moses’ men running into homes full of families, killing the father while the children and mother stand in the corner scared to death, then going to the young girl and shoving their fingers up her vagina to check and see if she is a virgin while she clings to her mother’s leg. While a young boy, covered in blood, clings to his dead father’s body. Then the young boy’s throat is sliced open by the men. Finally the men kill the mother and splatter her blood all over the daughter who’s vagina is bleeding all over the floor as she is taken captive as a virgin.</p>
<p>I will never worship a god that ordered that kind of horrid shit.<br>
[/quote]what the fuck… i was about to go to bed[/quote]It’s in the Bible. If you want I can get the actual verse.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Numbers 31 7-17 - (shortened by me to get to the point)</p>
<p>(Verse 7) They fought against Midian, as the LORD commanded Moses, and killed every man.<br>
(Verse 17) <span class="bbcode-b">Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man</span><br>
(Verse 18) <span class="bbcode-b">But save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man</span>.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Now this brings me to a quote:</p>
<p>“Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness, with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon, than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness, that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind.”</p>
<p>-Thomas Paine</p>
