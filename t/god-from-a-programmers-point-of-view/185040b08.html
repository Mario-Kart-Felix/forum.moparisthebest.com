        <p>[quote=“happy_world, post:161, topic:18504”]wait people you are blasphemebecause what are you saying GOD ALL MIGHTY doesn’t need a computer or anything. If GOD ALL MISGHTY needs something like computers, water , food wor whatever why is HE ALL MIGHTY GOD. GOD ALL MIGHTY doesn’t eat or drink and HE ALL MIGHTY tells a thing to be and it will be even before you blink your eye.</p>
<p>GOD ALL mighty is not a programmer  HE is the CREATER of everything.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well…this is kinda the point of the discussion.<br>
If ‘GOD ALL MIGHTY’ is a programmer, then he IS the creator of everything. He created the universe. He decided to make a ‘solar system’ with 4 gas ‘planets’ and 4 rock(?) ‘planets’, one of which he decided to create a simulation of life upon (and also decided to create a wierd asteroid thing that we now know as Pluto). His simulation of the ‘known universe’ IS his creation. Before it, as far as we know, there was nothing. He pieced together everything that we know exists. Thus, "GOD ALL MIGHTY’ may be a programmer.</p>
<p>Btw, food as we know it (according to this theory) is just ‘imaginary’. Bits and bytes (I know that was lame).</p>
<p>And one last thing, there is an explanation for all evil. If you created a simulation where everything was in pure harmony, and there was no fighting, no pain, no destruction, no hatred, then there would be no excitement. Even if your aim was to create some sort of simple educational device, you still want to have those factors rolled in since it exists in our society today. But if you ask ‘How about if ‘god’ didn’t live in such situations? How about if he simply lived in a Utopian-style place?’ Same thing applies. Just not the second part.</p>

</aside>
<p>See…that is what I’m trying to say. If we are in a simulation, ‘GOD ALL MIGHTY’ would be the programmer. We cannot see anything beyond him as he created all that we know to be true. He guides us to lead the life that we choose to. He made life as we know it and he chooses to maintain it.<br>
And, no, no-one ever said that ‘GOD ALL MIGHTY’ is a human, because he wouldn’t be a human as we know it. No simulation is perfect. To take the assumption that ‘GOD ALL MIGHTY’, in this theory, is a human, you would need to take that all possible programmers are human as well, or at least humans as we know it.<br>
We see him as ‘GOD ALL MIGHTY’ because he began all we know. Be enriched us with knowledge that he found himself. As far as we know, ‘GOD ALL MIGHTY’ might be the first person to ever play around with this technology.<br>
However, assuming this theory is true, all we know about god and religeon are almost all wrong. Maybe not all of it, but most of it would no longer apply. Everthing we know about our origin is inaccurate. Everything we know about with destiny and the ‘meaning of life’ is wrong. Just about all theories we know about the origin of the universe is wrong and was simply made like that just so that we are lead to believe all that we do believe. But then the horrific thing that would remain (should we discover that this theory is true (unlikely, i know)) is that all the beginnings of life, as all Christians know it, will be known as a lie. It was made as such and was believed to be such. Most Christian beliefs will go out the window.<br>
This would most likely be why whenever there is a debate that challenges Christian beliefs, the most vicious statements come from Christians.<br>
And as far as this debate goes, I hope we aren’t arguing about Christianity. (NB: I wasn’t arguing about Christianity since I was just pointing out certain facts surrounding the original topic)</p>
<p>Btw, I’m atheist.</p>

<p>I don’t know where you read that from, the entire point of the thread is that this theory fits in nicely with Christianity and most other religions as a whole.  Please point out exactly what is incompatible, because as far as I see it nothing is.</p>

However, assuming this theory is true, all we know about god and religeon are almost all wrong. Maybe not all of it, but most of it would no longer apply. Everthing we know about our origin is inaccurate. Everything we know about with destiny and the ‘meaning of life’ is wrong. Just about all theories we know about the origin of the universe is wrong and was simply made like that just so that we are lead to believe all that we do believe. But then the horrific thing that would remain (should we discover that this theory is true (unlikely, i know)) is that all the beginnings of life, as all Christians know it, will be known as a lie. It was made as such and was believed to be such. Most Christian beliefs will go out the window.<br>
This would most likely be why whenever there is a debate that challenges Christian beliefs, the most vicious statements come from Christians.<br>
And as far as this debate goes, I hope we aren’t arguing about Christianity. (NB: I wasn’t arguing about Christianity since I was just pointing out certain facts surrounding the original topic)[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t know where you read that from, the entire point of the thread is that this theory fits in nicely with Christianity and most other religions as a whole.  Please point out exactly what is incompatible, because as far as I see it nothing is.[/quote]</p>
<p>I take back the ‘most’ part but there are still some incompatibilites.<br>
In many bible readings that I have sat through (result of me not having a note saying I don’t <em>insert rest of note</em>), they keep saying that it is good to believe in God and that if you believe in him and do his word, then you will be granted a place in heaven (or something to that effect). Assuming that this is a fully practical programmer that we treat as God, why would this be? Why would this programmer ‘reward’ his simulations for devoting themselves to him? If he wanted to make a simulation where everything was devoted to him, then great, he could have done that.<br>
But assume that he WANTS to pick a good simulation from the others. Assume he created all his subjects differently (just by a little bit). Wouldn’t he just take the essence of that subject and (for some reason) put it in another simulation. This would mean that we are placed somewhere where we don’t remember anything from the past.<br>
If he wanted to seperate the ‘believers’ from the ‘unbelievers’ (or non-believers), then why would he put the non-believers into this dimension people describe as ‘hell’. What is the point of this?<br>
Most practical programmers would not think like this. It would be a waste of time and resources to create another universe. If the programmer wanted to make a world where he could be thoroughly entertained, why not just make a ‘hell’ and put a bunch of subjects there? Why go through the effort of making a universe (or sector of a universe) that would be deemed as Earth, then use up a bit chunk of resources seperating those who believe and those who don’t. It simply isn’t practical in a world where programmers are so advanced and have so much to learn from this amazing AI technology they have created.</p>
<p>However, if our universe was created from a distributed software (meaning that the technology had existed for a long time) then ignore everything in this post and the quote section of my last post.</p>
<p>(NB: Sorry for any grammar or punctuation errors since I’ve been Alt+Tabbing to and from a War3 game)</p>
<p>EDIT: I just noticed I only spoke about one incompatibility. I’ll add something else once my brain kicks back into proper thinking mode.</p>

        <p>Actually I think “God” See’s life a a forum. See he is the administraitor and we are the users. He can kills use for sinng or breaking the “Ten Commandments”, And back in the day Jesus choose people to be his Mod’s. It really all make’s sence. And sence he is “founder of life and he all knowning being” is would make sence for him to be the admin. and just incase you ask, Jesus would be his second admin.</p>
