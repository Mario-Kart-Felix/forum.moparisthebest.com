light can travel in a vacuum so you dont need any air atoms for it to travel through. The going scientific theory is anti-matter which is the polar opposite of matter. And without light there is still matter you just cant see it, you can still touch it and you can still smell and hear it and if you’re wierd you can still taste it. Go and sit in a really deep cave and see what happens. There will be no light but the rocks still exist around you.</p>

        <p>Well, I have had these thoughts, too.</p>
<p>I just think that if God had programmed us to be individuals, then why would we have the same “model”?<br>
If we were in fact “individual” then wouldn’t everyone look completely different? Would we all be freakish looking blobs?</p>
<p>But, then if we were all blobs, we would still not be “individual”. Even if we are all “regular”, like we are now (Arms, legs, all that crap), and we are called “individual”<br>
by our parents and teachers and such - they are only basing this off of what they know about us.</p>
<p>But, when you get right down to it, God COULD NOT of made ANYTHING “individual”, because we are all supposedly made up of atoms, which would in turn make us not “individual”.</p>
<p>So, is God really wrong, or is he so clever that he has tricked us into thinking that everything has a meaning?</p>
<p>But (Yes, this will go on for a while.), if he has tricked us into believing in “meanings”, and they really don’t exist, then why are we alive/programmed to be here?</p>
<p>Is it just some game he likes to play with his pals? (You’ve all seen “God’s Playing Field”, right?)</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Are we just a small atom/file (Yes, I’m kinda going String Theory here…) that makes up one line of code “characters” folder in God’s server?? Are we just files that he forgot to get rid of? Are we just here because God got bored one day? (Trust me, I know what that feels like.)</p>
<p>Or, are we here to do something?</p>

Well, I have had these thoughts, too.</p>
<p>I just think that if God had programmed us to be individuals, then why would we have the same “model”?<br>
If we were in fact “individual” then wouldn’t everyone look completely different? Would we all be freakish looking blobs?</p>
<p>But, then if we were all blobs, we would still not be “individual”. Even if we are all “regular”, like we are now (Arms, legs, all that crap), and we are called “individual”<br>
by our parents and teachers and such - they are only basing this off of what they know about us.</p>
<p>But, when you get right down to it, God COULD NOT of made ANYTHING “individual”, because we are all supposedly made up of atoms, which would in turn make us not “individual”.</p>
<p>So, is God really wrong, or is he so clever that he has tricked us into thinking that everything has a meaning?</p>
<p>But (Yes, this will go on for a while.), if he has tricked us into believing in “meanings”, and they really don’t exist, then why are we alive/programmed to be here?</p>
<p>Is it just some game he likes to play with his pals? (You’ve all seen “God’s Playing Field”, right?)</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Are we just a small atom/file (Yes, I’m kinda going String Theory here…) that makes up one line of code “characters” folder in God’s server?? Are we just files that he forgot to get rid of? Are we just here because God got bored one day? (Trust me, I know what that feels like.)</p>

you are failing to see how this would work. The creator would be completely sperate from our universe, he creates everything within it from the begining of time ie the big bang up until now. So in our history there has never been anything as advanced as what we have now, but our creator made our entire universe to be like that. He has made it so that nothing on earth is as advanced as us. You are failing to grasp that everything in our entire universe, were this theory true, is just a peice of program none of would actually be real. This includes things such as religion, the bible, our knowledge of the planet, our knowledge of anything etc</p>
