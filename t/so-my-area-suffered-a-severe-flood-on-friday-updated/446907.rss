    <title>So my area suffered a severe flood on Friday. [Updated]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-my-area-suffered-a-severe-flood-on-friday-updated/446907</link>
    <description>Yeah due to heavy rain (a months worth of rain in just a few hours) on friday my village and the surrounding towns suffered a severe flood (worst its ever been) The river here is below a 15-20ft wall as part of the flood defence and it came up and over onto the main road I&#39;ve taken too many photos to post onto here so ill just post my facebook album which hopefully if i&#39;ve set it up right everybody can view, It has been on national news and in the national papers also.. my boss was on radio 5 live and also calender news and i think Sky news too.


But anyway, my place of work, needs a whole new renovation as it was up to my stomach in water and it backlogged all the toilets so it all has to be sanitized too, the flood in the side restaraunt has bulged up about 7-8 inches and im out of work for a good couple of weeks.

Hopefully the pictures will explain everything and show everything but yeah :D Water was even flowing down my street which it has never done also.

Heres the link to the album... if it doesnt work i will just upload a few of the photos to here.

[url=http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151071424411393.488202.716906392&amp;type=3]Facebook[/url]

PS if anyone knows how to get it so It shows for example &quot;link here&quot; instead of the full URL I have forgotton -.-


Just to give you an idea.. the average level for the river in my village is around 1metre... on friday it reached 4.29m


BBC In pictures:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-18563258

for those that cant see the album here are a selection... Also if people want to see what the river is like usually let me know.

When it was dark the river was actually coming over this bit of the wall

Again when it was dark the river was up to the top of the banner

A brand new BMW X5 police car that had got stuck, On the LED board in the back window it said &quot;flood&quot;... Made me chuckle.

              <p>Yeah due to heavy rain (a months worth of rain in just a few hours) on friday my village and the surrounding towns suffered a severe flood (worst its ever been) The river here is below a 15-20ft wall as part of the flood defence and it came up and over onto the main road I’ve taken too many photos to post onto here so ill just post my facebook album which hopefully if i’ve set it up right everybody can view, It has been on national news and in the national papers also… my boss was on radio 5 live and also calender news and i think Sky news too.</p>
<p>But anyway, my place of work, needs a whole new renovation as it was up to my stomach in water and it backlogged all the toilets so it all has to be sanitized too, the flood in the side restaraunt has bulged up about 7-8 inches and im out of work for a good couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Hopefully the pictures will explain everything and show everything but yeah <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Water was even flowing down my street which it has never done also.</p>
<p>Heres the link to the album… if it doesnt work i will just upload a few of the photos to here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151071424411393.488202.716906392&amp;type=3" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook</a></p>
<p>PS if anyone knows how to get it so It shows for example “link here” instead of the full URL I have forgotton -.-</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea… the average level for the river in my village is around 1metre… on friday it reached 4.29m</p>
<p>BBC In pictures:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-18563258" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-18563258</a></p>
<p>for those that cant see the album here are a selection… Also if people want to see what the river is like usually let me know.</p>
