    <description>Hello, and welcome to the official development thread of my newest project!


[center][u][i][b][size=18pt]Lost Dynasty[/size][/b][/i][/u][/center]


Lost Dynasty will be a server based on dedication and competition, the server will contain many mini-games and small quests to do in-between you&#39;re experience of the server. The main focus of the server will be to have one of the best economy-based servers around. What you will realize is that all throughout the development I will show-case multiple things that will prove the server&#39;s toughness and uniqueness. Please enjoy. 


Goals: 
Create an environment both new players and old players will enjoy constantly.
Continue to upgrade the server with new features and mini-games to keep everyone preoccupied.
Be known as one of the best (if not the best :p) economy based servers around.
Release the server for people to use as a base for feature server.
There are many other goals however I do not feel like typing them all out as they are personal goals I wish to achieve creating this server.


Current Status: Alpha.
Current Task: Laying down the foundation for the mini-games/cities that people will explore.
