    <title>The Perfect Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-perfect-server/446968</link>
    <description>Recently, with me working on Rarity again, I&#39;ve pondered the idea of what kind of server I would make after the base is done. I&#39;ve been torn between three paths, which I&#39;ll explain below. But first, I know there&#39;s already a topic like this, but this addresses things differently.

The first path is a remake of the old servers, that featured pking everywhere except the Varrock bank and training room. This would be nothing like B2B, which was an utter failure. I wouldn&#39;t overdo the features.

The second is the kind of server I enjoyed playing on in the more recent days. The home would be Entrana, with a 508 game frame, featuring many of the things DeltaScape had - in terms of training, teleports, and such. There would be a bunch of customs, like wings and the like, and a nice area specifically for skilling. A public yell command would be available, and donations wouldn&#39;t really give anything away except rares. I&#39;m basically describing the server I played continuously and loved every minute of, and even attempted to make my own version of when it died.

The third is a RuneScape remake. Now before you touch your palm to your face, hear me out. I really miss the old RuneScape feeling, and one of the biggest things I think of is the full use of the world, with NPCs everywhere and countless areas to train and get items. The reason it&#39;d be a remake is because if I made a server utilizing the whole world, it&#39;d basically be RuneScape but poorly done with a ton of corners cut, so it might as well be a good remake. Little things would also be a big thing to aim for (heh, ironic), because I feel the little things are what made RuneScape so special and what all remakes ignore and prevent me from getting that &quot;feeling&quot;. I also wouldn&#39;t make it a long-term goal either - I&#39;d probably have it playable early on after I&#39;ve got some skilling and NPC spawns in, and add [b]quests[/b], [b]minigames[/b], and other stuff as I go along (Also there&#39;s no way I&#39;d be able to recreate the whole game. That&#39;s just insanity).

So I want you guys to help me decide. The first one isn&#39;t really a big concern, but more of something I&#39;d aim for if I was trying to get the basics of a server started and would be really fun to play. It&#39;s moreso the second and third options that have got me stuck, because both would be very fun for me and other players, and although I didn&#39;t go into much detail with any of them, hopefully you get what I&#39;m trying to describe.

              <p>I think your idea of server completion is a bit exhausting, Back when I ran a server I knew I would not be able to have all the content desired instantly so I would fill a region with content and allow users to play in the area but when they attempted to go to regions with no content I would stop the walking queue effectively keeping them in a content bound area. This allowed me to have people test the content I added without allowing to go in places that had absolutely nothing.  It worked well and gave a sense of “Server updates” when I would allow new regions to be walkable.</p>

              <p>For me, A good server isn’t a remake.  What I want is basically something more customized, even without custom items, but rather you do something besides the generic “login-buy gear-train-pk-leave”.  You should also make use of the whole map and make people travel rather than just clicking a teleport icon into a cave.</p>
<p>One idea I’m going to put in my server, for example, would be that teleporting is free, however it requires you to walk to that location beforehand, sort of like fast travel in skyrim.  Another idea is to possibly use mana for spells, however runes could substitute for it if you run out.</p>
<p>Just things that you don’t see often in servers that could improve or add interest to gameplay.  They don’t all need to be new ideas, just something fresh from the shit we have out now.</p>

<p>The old server remakes are amazing at first, but they got boring because your main goal was to loot the cash that was on the ground that respawned and not get killed (atleast for me anyways, I was 10 when those and other Moparscape servers were the only ones around :P)</p>

I’ll tell you about my absolute favorite servers. Base at the Varrock fountain with a moderate-fast skill level up, so it doesnt take too long to level stuff up. Then since it doesnt take too long to level up but it’s still kind of a challenge everyone will eventually run to the varrock pk and have a good old fassion pk =p. Varrock based is the best from my exp, with a good mix of skill and pk.<br>

              <p>Recently, with me working on Rarity again, I’ve pondered the idea of what kind of server I would make after the base is done. I’ve been torn between three paths, which I’ll explain below. But first, I know there’s already a topic like this, but this addresses things differently.</p>
<p>The first path is a remake of the old servers, that featured pking everywhere except the Varrock bank and training room. This would be nothing like B2B, which was an utter failure. I wouldn’t overdo the features.</p>
<p>The second is the kind of server I enjoyed playing on in the more recent days. The home would be Entrana, with a 508 game frame, featuring many of the things DeltaScape had - in terms of training, teleports, and such. There would be a bunch of customs, like wings and the like, and a nice area specifically for skilling. A public yell command would be available, and donations wouldn’t really give anything away except rares. I’m basically describing the server I played continuously and loved every minute of, and even attempted to make my own version of when it died.</p>
<p>The third is a RuneScape remake. Now before you touch your palm to your face, hear me out. I really miss the old RuneScape feeling, and one of the biggest things I think of is the full use of the world, with NPCs everywhere and countless areas to train and get items. The reason it’d be a remake is because if I made a server utilizing the whole world, it’d basically be RuneScape but poorly done with a ton of corners cut, so it might as well be a good remake. Little things would also be a big thing to aim for (heh, ironic), because I feel the little things are what made RuneScape so special and what all remakes ignore and prevent me from getting that “feeling”. I also wouldn’t make it a long-term goal either - I’d probably have it playable early on after I’ve got some skilling and NPC spawns in, and add <span class="bbcode-b">quests</span>, <span class="bbcode-b">minigames</span>, and other stuff as I go along (Also there’s no way I’d be able to recreate the whole game. That’s just insanity).</p>
<p>So I want you guys to help me decide. The first one isn’t really a big concern, but more of something I’d aim for if I was trying to get the basics of a server started and would be really fun to play. It’s moreso the second and third options that have got me stuck, because both would be very fun for me and other players, and although I didn’t go into much detail with any of them, hopefully you get what I’m trying to describe.</p>
