    <title>What did you think about Near Reality?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-did-you-think-about-near-reality/526306</link>
    <description>After reading the comments in this thread on Rune-Server [url=http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/advertise/263257-near-reality-24-7-where-legends-go-when-rs-got-shit-11.html]http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/advertise/263257-near-reality-24-7-where-legends-go-when-rs-got-shit-11.html[/url], I see so many complaints on how bad the server was, yet all they could say is &quot;I hate the customs&quot;, &quot;Shitty Combat&quot;, &#39;I hate Delta&quot;, and &quot;How does this server have so many people.&quot;  

Now lets think about this.  I started playing Near Reality when the new RS Models where coming in...I hated the new Rs models so i started playing Near Reality, because it had a enormous player base.  After seeing when i play I&#39;m sure there where people that did the same as I did.  Also this server had the looks.  The forums looked sexy, it had a wiki page, high scores, and even a price check on items.  This server had it going.  During this time I loved customs, so I like Near Reality for its customs, its npcs graphics, not sure if thats the proper term for it, and all of its items it had to offer.  Plus It had achievements.  Again reasons of me liking the server was proply why some people played it.  I&#39;m not saying Near Reality was the best, but the server connected to people.  Now I love to do boxing and do range on tds and stuff and during that I made some money, but not as much as the players around Near Reality since their economy was built around Customs and PVP.

Now Why was Near Reality successful with all these complaints?  Well Customs probably brought the first players on..before it became popular since that is why people played private servers back before hardcore pkers reached private servers.  Now I heard that this was the most paid for private server with no-lag, 24/7, staff always online, and just great service. Also hearing his profits off of donations and putting the donations to advertise the server to the highest standards.  This server put all the other servers to shame with all these advertisements going on. With the economy rolling and high spending in advertisement, this server reached number 1 even thou no one liked it and was confused on why it was so popular.

Question to you...Why don&#39;t you guys follow what Near Reality did?  They became big with so called &quot;shitty content,&quot; had the largest player base before RuneScape shut them down due to a popularity contest, I&#39;m 60% sure that&#39;s why Near Reality got shut down, the copyright is for RuneScape to say fuck you private servers.


What do you guys think about Near Reality?
To be nice i&#39;ll do what I had to do in speech.
Say one thing nice, if you can.
and If you do have complaints say only two.</description>

<p>I joined it as it was one of the top ranks, and while playing it I never looked back.<br>
I loved the server itself, content. I found it enjoyable, while others may not have.</p>
<p>There’s a few things I disliked too.<br>
Alot of the staff, not naming names, were up themselves, rude, etc etc.<br>
The economy was shocking, I had around 4.5t before I quit.</p>
