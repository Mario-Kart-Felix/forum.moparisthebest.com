    <title>School network exploting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/school-network-exploting/301311</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not experienced in the field of network exploiting, and I want to know if it is possible to &quot;hack&quot; or &quot;crack&quot; (As many people misinterpret the real meaning of the words.) into files on the network you&#39;re on, but do not have access to.

All of my school&#39;s computers are linked together on multiple server&#39;s spread across the campus.

[b]Information that might help:[/b](These are only guesses as I am not completely sure.)

I infer that they have an &quot;access&quot; system that allows different users to have different accesses, such as students(me) have student access, teachers have teacher access, then there is the admin access that has full access.

Each user has it&#39;s own folder on the server that is accessible by that user only, or someone that has higher accesses. (Teachers can view the students server-sided folder but can&#39;t view other teacher&#39;s folders. Students can look at there server-sided folder only.)

I checked the location of my server-sided folder and it was (\\schoolDis\students\4300621\My documents)

I got into &quot;schoolDis&quot; but as I was looking trough all the files I could not find the &quot;students&quot; folder, I did have hidden folders enabled to show up.. So they are not completely stupid.

They log in to a user using the user login in on windows vista/XP after boot up and they view the files by the normal windows explorer.(The file viewer not the web browser -.-) Windows-KEY+E

[b]Now to my question:[/b]
How would I at least view the &quot;students&quot; folder in this situation, from my user account witch I think has student access.

<p>If you go into explorer, go tools, map network drive, choose a letter, then in the folder field put in that server you had (\schoolDis\students) then click finish, it will add a new drive pointing at the students folder. If you have access to one of the folders inside there, i.e. your own, you should be able to open this new drive. Once in there, there will most likely be all the folders for the students, and I’m pretty sure they will be restricted.</p>
<p>Alternatively, befriend one of the network admins, and get him to show you how the network works.[/quote]</p>
<p>The first statement is possible, although the second one is pretty much improbable since there is only 2 network admins to my knowledge, and only one stays on campus. His name is Tom and the only reason I know this is because I had to go into his office and prove to the stupid school that I wasn’t impersonating the assistant principle… Dumbasses. &gt;.&gt;</p>
