    <title>Adding emotes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-emotes/366255</link>
    <description>Well, I went to add emotes to my client, such as D claws, swh, vls, morrigans jav/axe, but it didn&#39;t seem to work, My animation.java file looks nothing like my friends client.

I&#39;m using PI, a few people said slash client, but others said Galkon&#39;s enhanced.
Someone said all the animations are packed, so if someone could help?

I will rep++ if you help me fix this, I have msn, Teamviewer, just message me.
