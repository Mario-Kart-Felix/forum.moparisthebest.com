    <title>Can someone help me make a RSPS pleeeeeaasssseeee!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-help-me-make-a-rsps-pleeeeeaasssseeee/384378</link>
    <description>Hello, everyone I want to make a RSPS and I&#39;m having a lot of trouble with it.
So...I was wondering if anyone one here knows how to make a RSPS and wouldn&#39;t mind helping me make one over Team Viewer.

I have already made a no-ip account, and downloaded the no-ipduc thing and enabled my server.

I need help with port forwarding

I have not yet found a good client/source to use because i want a good one with no problems and stuff because i am no good with code, and would like some cool customs and such.

So if you could help me make it/and put it online, ill make you Co-Owner or Admin depending on how much stuff you know,Also if you know how to code and could teach me how to add customs and stuff / and teach me how to server reset and make people admins and stuff I would really appreciate it.

So if you could post below if you could help me I would really love it.

My aim is: Mea Mea
My xbox live gamer tag: We Be Tro11in

Thank-You.</description>
