    <description>I haven&#39;t had a private server.. in like.. 2 years...
Im about to try to make a new one again, but I don&#39;t remember too much about this.

Edited 90% of my source, Port forwarded and all that...

Problem is, I cant run the server.

I hit RunServer.Exe and this comes up....



[IMG]http://i43.tinypic.com/21nf91j.jpg[/img]


It keeps saying Null, millions of times.
I just showed the top of the window, to show what it says, before it says Null.

I only blanked out the server name.



Edit: Im hearing its a simple Anti-Leecher mechinism.

I am looking through the Client.Java, And I have found...

[code]
	/* MISC */
	public int i;

	private java.io.InputStream in; //private java.io.DataInputStream in;
	private java.io.OutputStream out; //private java.io.DataOutputStream out;

	public stream inStream = null, outStream = null;

	public Cryption inStreamDecryption = null, outStreamDecryption = null;

	private java.net.Socket mySock;


	public int KillerId = playerId;

public void lowGFX(int id, int delay) {
mask100var1 = id;
mask100var2 = delay;
mask100update = true;
updateRequired = true;
}
public void specGFX(int gfx) { [/code]


could something in here, be the reason for it?

I say outstream Null, in Java..

I haven&#39;t used private servers in years, I&#39;m just trying to start one up again.





Also, If I try compiling the server, this comes up... If this helps any..

So I went in Client.Java, and I found the spot here....

[code]
        if(TzWave == 20)
        {
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2741, 2381, 5106, heightLevel)
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2630, 2406, 5071, heightLevel);
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2627, 2383, 5069, heightLevel);
            NeededKills = 69;
        } [/code] 



But if I replace that with 


[code]        if(TzWave == 20)
        {
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2741, 2381, 5106, heightLevel);
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2630, 2406, 5071, heightLevel);
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2627, 2383, 5069, heightLevel);
            NeededKills = 69;
        } [/code]


Which, In theory, should Fix the problem.


I get this error when I compile the server....

Please dont sit here and say &quot;its anti-leech for a reason, so you can fix it on your own!!&quot;


Im trying to..
And I did what in theory should work, and it didnt work..


Im not a leecher thats just trying to take someone elses server and run it as my own, im actually trying to do this on my own, and I am stuck..</description>

You can’t edit Player.class, its a class file.<br>

              <p>It’s an anti-leech I guess. Meaning to be able to use it, you will have to fix it. It probably is something very simple, but it is used to keep people who do not know what they are doing away from the server really.</p>

              <p>I haven’t had a private server… in like… 2 years…<br>
Im about to try to make a new one again, but I don’t remember too much about this.</p>
<p>Edited 90% of my source, Port forwarded and all that…</p>
<p>Problem is, I cant run the server.</p>
<p>I hit RunServer.Exe and this comes up…</p>
<p><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/21nf91j.jpg" alt width="669" height="337"></p>
<p>It keeps saying Null, millions of times.<br>
I just showed the top of the window, to show what it says, before it says Null.</p>
<p>I only blanked out the server name.</p>
<p>Edit: Im hearing its a simple Anti-Leecher mechinism.</p>
<p>I am looking through the Client.Java, And I have found…</p>
<p>[code]<br>
/* MISC */<br>
public int i;</p>
<pre><code>private java.io.InputStream in; //private java.io.DataInputStream in;
private java.io.OutputStream out; //private java.io.DataOutputStream out;

public stream inStream = null, outStream = null;

public Cryption inStreamDecryption = null, outStreamDecryption = null;

private java.net.Socket mySock;


public int KillerId = playerId;
</code></pre>
<p>public void lowGFX(int id, int delay) {<br>
mask100var1 = id;<br>
mask100var2 = delay;<br>
mask100update = true;<br>
updateRequired = true;<br>
}<br>
public void specGFX(int gfx) { [/code]</p>
<p>could something in here, be the reason for it?</p>
<p>I say outstream Null, in Java…</p>
<p>I haven’t used private servers in years, I’m just trying to start one up again.</p>
<p>Also, If I try compiling the server, this comes up… If this helps any…</p>
<p><img src="http://i44.tinypic.com/2akjzht.jpg" alt width="665" height="335"></p>
<p>So I went in Client.Java, and I found the spot here…</p>
<p><code>
        if(TzWave == 20)
        {
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2741, 2381, 5106, heightLevel)
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2630, 2406, 5071, heightLevel);
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2627, 2383, 5069, heightLevel);
            NeededKills = 69;
        } </code></p>
<p>But if I replace that with</p>
<p><code>        if(TzWave == 20)
        {
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2741, 2381, 5106, heightLevel);
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2630, 2406, 5071, heightLevel);
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2627, 2383, 5069, heightLevel);
            NeededKills = 69;
        } </code></p>
<p>Which, In theory, should Fix the problem.</p>
<p>I get this error when I compile the server…</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i43.tinypic.com/2004kgh.jpg" title="2004kgh.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/2004kgh.jpg" alt width="589" height="500"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>
<p>Please dont sit here and say “its anti-leech for a reason, so you can fix it on your own!!”</p>
<p>Im trying to…<br>
And I did what in theory should work, and it didnt work…</p>
<p>Im not a leecher thats just trying to take someone elses server and run it as my own, im actually trying to do this on my own, and I am stuck…</p>
