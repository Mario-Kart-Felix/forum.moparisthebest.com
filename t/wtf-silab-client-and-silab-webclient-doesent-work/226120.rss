    <description>WTF SILAB CLIENT AND SILAB WEBCLIENT DOESENT WORK!

It doesen&#39;t load the actual client on the client, as for the webclient it just doesen&#39;t load the website which has the webclient on.

Is everyone whitnessing this problem?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 15, 2008, 11:40:25 am[/size][hr]I guess &quot;Silabsoft&quot; - (silabsoft.org/smf/index.php) is updating but i would like someone else to back this error i have and maybe everyone has up.

 Thank you.</description>
