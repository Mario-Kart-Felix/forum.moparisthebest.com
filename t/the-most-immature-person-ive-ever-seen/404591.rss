    <title>The most immature person I&#39;ve ever seen</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-most-immature-person-ive-ever-seen/404591</link>
    <description>So of a few of you may know I had &#39;won&#39; an account in the Runescape section. This [b]xxlukexx[/b] is the person I&#39;d won it off of. The message I got back from him consisted of this:
[quote=&quot;xxlukexx&quot;]UMAD?[/quote]
Something needs to be done about this. People can&#39;t go around &#39;giving&#39; these account away and don&#39;t give it to the person because they don&#39;t know/like them. It goes against the whole &#39;giving away&#39; idea. Everyone know&#39;s that most of them are rigged anyway, so here&#39;s a call to arms, against these &#39;give away threads, THEY MUST be added to the rules in the Runescape Discussion board such as the loaning GP was, they must be banned.

Also before I forget. He also used Si Force to lock the thread before I was able to reply asking for the information and  he also blocked my PMs.</description>

</aside>
<p>If it’s going to lead to a discussion/thread such as this one, I wouldn’t be surprised it there was a rule such as Mihalich posted. I’m not going to lie, creating a thread about it isn’t going to work.</p>
<p>So I suppose leave it at that mate or somehow get in contact with this member and ask him for the information.</p>
