Welcome to the official Allastasia Test Server(s), the Allastasia test servers have recently been put online - enabling you to help the developers, find, finish, test, newly added content! 

Utilising the test servers, you will really be able to get a feel as to what you will be experiencing in the full game. Not all content will be added to the test servers due to development reasons. But you will still get the chance to experience most content.

We encourage you more than anything to find bugs and unfinished / unimplemented assists, such as; Unspawned or unfinished npcs, dialogues, objects, quests, interfaces, etc. Be sure to post anything in the [url=http://&quot;http://www.allastasia.com/forum/index.php?/forum/7-suggestions/&quot;]Suggestions[/url] &amp; [url=http://&quot;http://www.allastasia.com/forum/index.php?/forum/18-report-a-bugdupe/&quot;]Bug Reports[/url] sections. Don&#39;t forget to ask any [url=http://&quot;http://www.allastasia.com/forum/index.php?/forum/61-questions/&quot;]questions[/url]!

It is advised that for the best game play in the full release, you make as many suggestions and reports as to what needs adding. It would also make a big help if you gather information from Runescape e.g. Dialogues, npc spawning positions, animations etc. You can make threads in the suggestions section posting a contribution thread with your information you have gathered. Doing so would make the development process much faster.

What are you waiting for? Get on now and play!

Now it is advised that you take this into account: You are not playing on Allastasia itself, this is just a testing ground so you can get a small feel of the gameplay, and to help the developers out with feedback, suggestions and help gathering information. Although we encourage you to enjoy yourself, we do not want you to judge this server as if this were the full version. This is merely just a testing ground for you to all test content. Not all content has been added to the test server.
