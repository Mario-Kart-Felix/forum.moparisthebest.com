    <description>[u][b]-PLEASE CAN YOU POST IF YOU THINK I COULD IMPROVE MY SERVER IN ANY WAY. I REALLY WANT TO IMPROVE IT-[/b][/u]

I am currently working on a server, that i, being honest have spent 20 days of no life coding on. It includes
some really awesome stuff and when im finished hosting i DEFINATELY WANT TO RELEASE IT AS A BASE. So
far, id say everything that ive ever wanted in a server is in it.

[u][b]-FEATURES-[/b][/u]

[u][b]MOST RECENT - THIS WILL BE CONSTANTLY UPDATED[/b][/u]

[b]fixed xlogging[/b], it now [b]deletes every item in pack + invent[/b]

[b]stopped all 1 itemers [/b] by adding in few lines of code saying you [b]need a platebody, legs and wep to
attack [/b] someone

stopped[b] farmers [/b] by making it so people cant attack people without [b]a GOOD wep leg and platebody.[/b]

added fully working runescape [b]godsword and sara sword [/b] weilding [b]attack standing and running effects[/b].
[u][b]
-OTHER FEATURES-[/b][/u]


100% PVP World with a balanced 10 level difference at the home. - even though there is a pvp world LIKE rune
scape, i have kept the normal drop system as i find it thrilling to pk someone elses gear :)

Added in fully working pvp store that accepts different pvp values and then subtracts the pvp points away fro
m your character file.

Added in fully working pvp armors, stat ham, vls and vesta spear all wth fully working specials and realistic stats.

Added elysian spirit shield with special that increases your helath by half of what you hit

Made claws hit 4 times with halving hits so it doesnt overpower against people

Inserted correct gfx for all basic items with realistic specials

Changed the pavement and water gfx to HD on a 317 server

Added all fully working godsword specials

Created PVP points and suitible voids to make it so you gain more pvp points dependant on how much cash (in s
hop value) you ha
ve on you.

Added a unique ranks system which checks to see what kills your on, and when speaking or yelling adds a certain
 rank dependant 
on your kills after your name, increasing the showoffyness of your player

Added perfect kills system

Loads more but most are just the cleaned delta base i used

[u][b]-WHAT I NEED TO DO NEXT-[/b][/u]

make barrage hit multi in multi wild with and stopping it barraging on players that are lower level then you if barra
ge does its multi 
effect

add bounty hunter - in progress with help from exrendum

Add rewards for gaining titles - Working on it, should be done soon

[u][b]-PICTURES-[/b][/u]

              <p>Personaly i love your sources Demise. Im a new coder, and ive used about all your sources. I do agree with the client though, the water looks fake. I love everything else though, sadly i cannot help you with your server, because i fail. But besides that point i think it looks great.</p>

              <p>Actualy your current devlopment is crap, becous one client hacking screws up evrything couses errors.<br>
The playerkilling method is from jinrake right?<br>
the lines u made yust laggs the server, make a simple code that you don’t earn any points if u kill the same players in the same ammout of time thats peace of cake. About the one itemers make that they loose all there items , no crappy codes , The prayers u cannot call devlopment becous thats <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> your work.<br>
u need to make the anti xlog proper.<br>
For the gs stance there are guides now,<br>
Well goodluck devloping but i think this devlopment wil fail.</p>
