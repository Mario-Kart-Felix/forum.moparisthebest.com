    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;ve been through most of the sections here in the server area and after exploring for a good while and trying quite a few different servers and clients, I want to ask some questions. When it says &quot;project insanity&quot; or &quot;delta&quot; what exactly are those? and which one of those is going to get me closer to the actual runescape that we know today, like that has primal and claws, things like that. I know that this question may be looked down at, but trust me I have been looking all day and this is not the only day I have spent searching for the right server. So if you guys know of any good servers that you would recomend me to check out, please post em here! and please try to answer my questions about delta and project insanity terms.

Thanks guys,
also if this is in the wrong section let me know.</description>

Project Insanity use to be a Alright base to use before every one started telling people to switch from delta to it, but what none of them realized is that it wasn't the base that was so bad it was the fact that all the people wanted to do was take credits for others work. now everybody does the same thing with Project insanity i rarely ever see any "unique content" in project insanity servers but it is packaged which will help you and it is the most content heavy base so that would be the answer to you question.</blockquote>
<p>I agree with 100% pi is over used and delta just sucks, but im currenty make a pi that is unique very much iv been coding for 3 months now and loveandpower that picture is extremly funny</p>

              <p>Well, I’m not too sure really how exactly to explain what PI’s and Delta’s are. I can tell you they’re a type of server, and they’re both 317’s. 317’s do not have dragon claws, primal armor, or any of that stuff unless it has customs added to it. If you want something that looks more like RuneScape today, you want a server that’s probably 508+ so that you can have those items and they’re already added in and have newer looking graphics.</p>
