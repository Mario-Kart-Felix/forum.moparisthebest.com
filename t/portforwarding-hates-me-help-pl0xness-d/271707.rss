    <description>k well, after millions of attempts to open port 43594 on my router (DIR 628) it still continues not to work. but also on my no-ip, it shows my ip as a completly different ip than what it should b, e.g ill use random numbers.... 194.178.0.1 say that was my ip, well it would show as  like (random numbers) 209.30.240.63. so i tried opening that ip instead but it says &quot;is not a lan IP&quot; or w.e, so basically i have to stick with my usual ip. so i tried to change the no-ip&#39;s ip adress to the one i put origanlly, but it always resets back to this ip. so how am i supose to portforward if the ip&#39;s wont work together? ;[. btw i can run my server on dial up, but no highspeed l.</description>
