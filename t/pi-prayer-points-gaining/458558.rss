    <description>Yes, most of you are thinking i&#39;m a noob, but i can&#39;t seem to ind out how to make my prayer points go up with my prayer level, i&#39;ve tried everything, usually what happens is it only goes up one point when i gain multiple levels, how do i fix this? I&#39;m not sure what code to post, so please tell me what file i should post. eg. PlayerAssistant.java  Prayer.Java
Btw: i tried this under PlayerAssisstant.java where it says you level up i also put &quot;c.playerLevel[5] += 1&quot; i&#39;m not sure if that would do anything but i tried many many things all ended in failure please respond</description>
