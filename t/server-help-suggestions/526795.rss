    <description>1) Make a post requirement to post on there
2) Actually check to see who is making multiple accounts and discipline accordingly in that section
3) I suggest making different &quot;level&quot; boards for server help. Let me explain... there could be an &quot;amateur&quot; , &quot;intermediate&quot; and a &quot;professional&quot; level board. These boards would be moderated as seen fit and would then make it easier on us to decipher who is wanting to be spoonfeed and who is just wanting general advice.
4) If #3 is &quot;out of the question&quot; then I believe we need some sort of system put in place to stop spoonfeeding overall. You know sometimes it isn&#39;t so bad to just google something for somebody and give them a link...but whena  person doesn&#39;t even TRY to learn that&#39;s when it becomes an insult to a helpers timer.</description>

<p>THIS is a an example of a good help topic</p>
<p>Now you won’t see this in most help topics that’s the issue I have with the section.</p>
<p>-he at least attempted (even if logic wasn’t in his favor lol)<br>
-he is willing to do the heavy work<br>
-and he is willing to work off what he gets</p>

<p>At rule <span class="hashtag">#3</span> - Same thing pretty much. In a perfect world, all new members here would be willing to learn and all of the current members would be willing to take the time to teach in help threads. Just isnt going to happen, and enforcing that rule strictly is going to kill the development on the site.</p>

<p>^ That’s a quoted post in server help rules and well yeah…like a good 75% of the topics in that section would be voided because of that.</p>
<blockquote>5. Make sure the titles of your topics are easy to read and are completely relevant to the topic at hand. Though this rule may be bent from time to time, make sure you follow it. A moderator on a bad day could easily lock a topic for breaking this rule.</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn’t consider “omg help me!@@@” being  “relevant” …</p>
<blockquote>3. We are not a Spoonfeeding community. We do not teach in an oversimplified manner to discourage independent thought. We encourage independent thought, meaning you must help yourselves before requesting help. Failure to provide some sort of prior knowledge or work to the problem will result in a lock of the topic. This is final.</blockquote>
<p>So in reality, I was right to think that there should be NO spoonfeeding. There should also be some “evidence” of their own attempts before we provide further support?</p>

It’s not as effective learning, but it is definitely still help. It’s like teaching a man to fish vs giving him a fish. You can feed him for a day so he doesn’t starve, which is still better than nothing if he doesn’t want you to teach him how to fish. Eventually he might give in and want to actually learn, but you can’t force someone to learn if they dont want to. Doesn’t mean we shouldn’t at least help them wet their toes in the world of RSPS. (The metaphor equivalent would be trying to teach him to fish before he even knows if he likes the taste of fish, you should let him decide if he wants to bother learning or not based on whether he enjoys it)</p>

I agree with David.  If you don’t let people who need help with RSPS post in server help, then where do you expect them to post?  Do you really want all other boards to become help boards?<br>
[/quote]there isn’t anything wrong with people asking for help if you don’t understand something I am all for assisting that person. However as I already stated people such as Sk8 and myself. Try to help in a way in which it will also help the persont o learn his own self. However it becomes a hindrance when they aren’t willing to learn and just want a “quick answer”</p>
<p>If I remember correctly wasn’t mopar founded on the terms of " teaching hacking"</p>
<p>(or something around those grounds? )[/quote]I don’t get why you are trying to restrict the person from posting if they want a ‘quick answer’.</p>

But if we just stop people from posting because are curious about RSPS but maybe not quite up to the daunting task of learning programming to really get into it yet, the community is going to die even faster. It’s just a bad idea.</p>

              <p>I believe it has been posted about before, but why not have a pop up that directs a user to a few topics that can be viewed over before they create a topic. These topics can include our compilation of common compiling errors, the rules of the board, hell why not a link to google also. If the user still cannot find the answer from any of those sources then they can just click a close button or a big red x and create their topic. This shouldn’t really hinder anyone, and if they wish to not continuing reviewing it they can hit a button that adds a cookie.</p>

Should they talk in general discussion first? Does that prove they ‘tried’? Maybe make a downloads topic or tutorial? It just doesn’t make any sense to have a requirement to post in server help.</p>
