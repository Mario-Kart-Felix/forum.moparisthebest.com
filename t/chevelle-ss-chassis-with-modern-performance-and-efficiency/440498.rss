    <title>Chevelle SS Chassis with modern performance and efficiency</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chevelle-ss-chassis-with-modern-performance-and-efficiency/440498</link>
    <description>Hey guys, 
I have always had a dream to have a perfect condition Chevelle SS such as the following:

http://www.fatchachie.com/70ChevelleSS.jpg

However, I&#39;m also looking for fuel efficiency (to an extent), performance, handling, and most of all: Safety.

My idea for some time has been to use a Chevelle SS chassis and possibly engine (depending on fuel efficiency), and add all the modern safety features and interior. Some may say, this is ruining a classic car. However, in reality, I cannot be driving a 1970 Chevelle SS around, I have to take into account fuel costs, safety and comfort. Long story short, A 2012 model dodge charger, Ford Mustang or Chevelle car with the 1970 Chevelle chassis.

Firstly, can anyone tell me if this is feasibile, of course I will have to seek professional help. Secondly, how much roughly will this cost? I wish to achieve the look of a 1970 Chevelle with the safety of a modern day muscle car.

Please note: I am from Australia, so the steering wheel is on the right side, if that is relevant.

All help is appreciated. Thank you.</description>

              <p>If you are going to do all of these modifications to it, you don’t want to buy one already restored in running order.  And you certainly don’t want to buy the more expensive SS model, when all you have to do is slap a few SS badges on the car after your done and no one will be the wiser.</p>
<p>As to price, can you follow this link?<br>
<a href="http://motors.shop.ebay.com/Cars-Trucks-/6001/i.html?_dmpt=US_Cars_Trucks&amp;_trksid=p2043143.m1603&amp;_mak=Chevrolet&amp;_mod=Chevelle&amp;_sop=7&amp;_fpos=45005&amp;" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://motors.shop.ebay.com/Cars-Trucks-/6001/i.html?_dmpt=US_Cars_Trucks&amp;_trksid=p2043143.m1603&amp;_mak=Chevrolet&amp;_mod=Chevelle&amp;_sop=7&amp;_fpos=45005&amp;</a><br>
Looks like you can get a decent one to work with anywhere from $2,000 to about $15,000.  Of course rare or already restored ones run more, but you don’t want one of those to modify.</p>
<p>When I have time to make a longer post, I’ll comment on your engine dilemma.</p>

<p>Theres a few options, but I’m leaning towards buying the Chevelle chassis and working up from there. Or if possible, buy an existing car, replace the chassis. Obviously run into a few problems doing either one, due to the chassis difference, however I’m hoping they can be overcome with professional help.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:3, topic:440498”]What do you mean by ‘safety’?

<p>You certainly aren’t going to get any type of fuel efficiency out of a motor like that if you are also after performance.

<p>Here in the USA, a 70 Chevelle would be very cheap and easy to work on, with just about any aftermarket part you would like available locally at a car show/swap meet or able to be ordered online.

<p>Decide on what you need performance-wise and such, and maybe I can give you some more pointers.[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh by safety I mean like brakes and handling. The body of these are definitely safer, most cars seem to be made of fibre glass nowadays :p.</p>
<p>I’m not after amazing performance, obviously an original chevelle engine would be amazing. But in regards to fuel mileage, pretty bad. My cousin has a Holden SSV 2010 model. It is extremely fast. Goes about 550km to a tank. And it gets up to about 280kmph. The tank does hold a bit. Ps sorry for inconvenient units.</p>
<p>I am not after super performance, but better than average. I want to engine to perform and sound like a sports car, but with better fuel efficiency. Just average fuel efficiency for a modern sports car will suffice. I’m more about the looks, so as long as the chassis is he one I want I’m not too fussed. Average fuel consumption, I’m not stupid enough to believe that a car with good perfOrmance won’t be amazing efficiency. I just want average efficiency for a modern standard car, even a bi worse is fine. With better than average performance and amazing sound. In regards to performance I won’t be looking for anything close to that of the chevelle, however higher than a standard car. Just trying to find the right balance.</p>
