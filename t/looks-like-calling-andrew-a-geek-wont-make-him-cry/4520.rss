    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Unfortunately I&#39;m a bit of a computer geek, I&#39;m not very good at PR :) (pretty obvious that!) People seem to think of me as some sort of corporate suit, and forget that I&#39;m actually still a programmer who started this game as a hobby. I don&#39;t normally get involved in customer support or rules enforcement at all I try to stick to what I&#39;m best at which is sitting in a darkened room and programming the game itself. My absolute aim above everything else is to make the best game I can.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I say money smoking/eating/drinking/licking/sucking person. He loves money like a fat person love cake.</description>

<p>Ok… FLAME ON!!!</p>
<p><em>Starts on Fire</em></p>
<p>Lemme start like this. Gower is a good-for- nothing money hungary child moslesting piece of monkey shit.</p>
<p>Gower probly ripped this game off someone worse than IMPsoft ripped their bot (sry had to throw that in <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ).</p>
<p>Gower will NEVER have kids, a wife, happiness, a clean game with no l337 h4x0rs like us… of course. The only thing Andrew Gower can get is a handjob from a gay guy for 15 bucks in some back alley.</p>
<p>Fuck you Gower… Fuck You…</p>
