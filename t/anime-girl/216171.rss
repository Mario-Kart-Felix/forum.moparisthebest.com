Doesn’t look right at all. You used some sort of digital font for the text. Which doesn’t go with the whole look of like an old Japanese Erotica from the Meiji Era. If that is what you were going for. The white and yellow on her fave ruins it, and the string of colors in this sig looks bad. Looks like they were just thrown on there. If you got rid of the color on the render, it might look a lot better. Do something to blend her hair on the left a bit more. Looks way too pixelated. As well as on the top of her head. The red in the background doesn’t go good with the left side of her blouse. Other than that it’s just another smudge sig.</p>

<p>Excuse me? He posted his image here for accurate constructive criticism. He put the work into his piece. I showed respect by giving him the best C&amp;C I could. Why don’t you shut the Hell up. You know nothing of the Graphics Sections. Go die.</p>
