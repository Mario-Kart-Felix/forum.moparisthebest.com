              <p>Servers can register on the server status page: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php</a></p>
<p>Simply look on the list and choose a server! (Some may require you to download a custom client designed for their server and all their pointless custom items.)</p>
<p>You do not have to use a set password, in fact you can use any username as well. This site and the servers are not joined in any way like that.</p>
