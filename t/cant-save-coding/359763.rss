    <title>Cant save coding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-save-coding/359763</link>
    <description>My server source and client wont run. A black screen will pop up then dissapear.  This happens with the compiler too. I did some research that told me if this happens somethings wrong with the coding. It also showed the correct coding. I copied the correct coding, hit edit with notepad on run, erased the old coding pasted the new one, hit save then exited out. It still dosent start and when i hit edit again the old coding is still there.

So pretty much it wont let me save the new coding. Someone please help ive beent trying to fix this for hours also if this helps i hit run with java and i set my system classpath and path to the newest jdk so i dont think thats the problem. also forgot to mention i do not think it is notepad that wont let me save it because i have tried notepad 2 microsoft word and wordpad. So i think it has to do with something not letting me save it for some reason please help.</description>
