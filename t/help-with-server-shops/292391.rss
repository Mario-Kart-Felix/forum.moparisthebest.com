<p>I have never seen a tutorial for adding shops to anything but a 508 or higher. And, I know Pokemondner never said if he was on a 317 or a 508, but I have never seen a tutorial on adding shops to a 317.</p>
<p>But, Pokemondner, there is a ‘Shop Generator’. I don’t have it, but it is pretty useful.[/quote]</p>
<p>wow…</p>
<p>every try searching cfg files? for… SHOP.CFG?</p>
