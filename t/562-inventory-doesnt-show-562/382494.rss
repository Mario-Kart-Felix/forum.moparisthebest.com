    <description>Hey guys..... I&#39;ve come to a huge problem in the development of my server.... My inventory doesnt work... If i pick stuff up, or spawn something it won&#39;t show up in my inventory... Even when i withdraw something from my bank, it says it was taken out of my bank, but it doesnt show up in my inventory.. Any help would be much appreciated.. :)</description>
