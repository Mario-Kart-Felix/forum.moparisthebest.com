    <title>Cache -&gt; client -&gt; deob process?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-client-deob-process/542819</link>
    <description>well, i decided to do something somewhat productive and attempt to teach myself a little bit about the client extraction and deobfuscation process and whatnot.

after countless hours of researching i learned about the pack200 compressed client inside the cache&#39;s main index archive, and the methods of which extracting it.
and i also found whitecastle&#39;s deobfuscator. after using both hand-in-hand, i have a decompiled client with thousands of errors (which i already knew it would be like this)

now, how exactly do i begin to understand the errors? [b]i&#39;m not looking to fix this, because i know i&#39;ll probably never make it that far. i just want to learn what&#39;s going on[/b]

[s]i see a lot of [code]IF expresssion
GOTO xxx_xxx_xxx
GOTO yyy_yyy_yyy
[/code]
[s]or
[code]IF expression
GOTO xxx_xxx_xxx
GOTO END_OF_METHOD[/code][s]what exactly is this saying, and how would i begin to rewrite it?[/s]

[b]edit: pretty sure these were just decompiling errors, as a fresh decompile of the class removed them.[/b]

also, i see a lot of the errors are runtime exceptions - i read somewhere on the old topics from mitb about whitecastle&#39;s deobber, is that it handles these poorly for some reason, and most of the time you just have to rewrite the exception (or something like that...  :|)

[b]edit: did more research, and saw i just need to catch the exception and remove the throw?[/b]

anywho, shit like this:
[code]try {
/*
blah
*/
} catch (RuntimeException someRuntimeException) {
}
throw xx.a(someRuntimeException, XXX);
[/code]


one last thing.. many of the fields are set to another field type, so how does someone find out the proper field type, because casting wont always work - or what other data is needed? such as
[code]byte[][] a;
...
int z = -1;
..
this.k = (z - -1);
..
this.a = new byte[this.k];[/code]so that&#39;s setting a 2d byte array, to a 1d byte array of a size 0?


im so lost in this, but i only want to learn, so any help is appreciated.</description>

<p>deobfuscation is not merely to make cheat clients. hell, you don’t even need to deobfuscate - you could just use reflection or something like bcel. deobfuscation is to make the code more understandable.</p>
<p>i only want the code to make more sense to me, and be complete. i’m not looking to refactor this, i only am attempting to get a feel of the cache format and perhaps modify an existing cache extractor.</p>

<p>I don’t think he is worried about the decompiling portion… he just wants to know how deobfuscation works, unless you thought the two were the same thing…</p>
<p>JAD is very outdated and will not work well with newer features of Java, FernFlower, although newer I do not believe is still actively maintained. Both poor choices when it comes to picking a decompiler anywho</p>

<p>You stated that we don’t have any way of knowing the field names, and that is infact false. The constant pool has an entry for every field and method that contains their name and signature. When Jagex obfuscates their code they are changed to one jumbled mess, and then after deobfuscation the decompiler will rename them to be something slightly better like anInt4532.</p>
<p>As for local variables, they are stored in the code by index only, so the decompiler picks names based on certain naming conventions. I-K and then repeat with cycle++ appended.</p>

              <p>Can you ask a specific question about obfuscation? What you have here is pretty jumbled.</p>
<p>[quote=“Vain_, post:1, topic:542819”]one last thing… many of the fields are set to another field type, so how does someone find out the proper field type, because casting wont always work - or what other data is needed? such as</p>
<p><code>byte[][] a;
...
int z = -1;
..
this.k = (z - -1);
..
this.a = new byte[this.k];</code>so that’s setting a 2d byte array, to a 1d byte array of a size 0?[/quote]</p>
<p>This is most likely <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> what is going on, you’re just having a hard time sifting through the obfuscated code.</p>
<p>Maybe you could show some examples of the code you’re trying to understand taken directly from the source?</p>
<p>Also regarding this:</p>
<p>[quote=“Vain_, post:8, topic:542819”]I could understand obfuscation of the variable names, but when I see things like <code>if (bool)
    ;</code>now how is anyone supposed to fix that? is this errors during the deobfuscation process, and perhaps another deobber will work?[/quote]</p>
<p>This code is what is commonly known as a ‘dummy’ for example in MITB’s re-factored client he removed all dummies, which are essentially bits of code that tries to confuse the reverse engineer (yourself), hence the entire point of obfuscation, make reverse engineering an application more difficult, this is one of the many techniques used to protect applications from people like us.</p>
<p>[quote=“Kiryn, post:19, topic:542819”]what would be the purpose of deob’ing then…</p>
