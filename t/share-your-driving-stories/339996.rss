    <title>Share Your Driving Stories</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/share-your-driving-stories/339996</link>
    <description>So anyway I had a awesome incident that made my day feel alot better so I decided to make this thread so we can all share interesting shit that happened while we were driving, ill start:

So today my dad took my vehicle to get the tires rotated so we switched vehicles and he let me drive his mercedes slk 350. So I took that too school and on the way home today I had to slow to wait for someone to complete a turn right (mind you I am in America) the speed limit being 45, there was a brand new camaro that was a bit behind me who obviously had somekind of fucked up thinking, that most arrogant people who buy american sports cars have, that allowed his brain to trigger and say well this is a no passing zone and im going around a corner but I should go ahead and pass a mercedes benz because I want to try and prove my american vehicle superioty over the german vehicle. So he then proceeds into the left lane (right lane is normal driving lane in america) and attempts a pass around me, but what he didn&#39;t know is that as soon as I saw him change into the other lane I slammed by fucking gas pedal as soon as the other drive turned the corner (which was a pretty quick corner turn) and im pretty sure this guy shit himself because not only is he going around a corner which he can&#39;t see oncoming traffic, I also cut him off before he could complete a pass (I was beside him and now proceeding to pass him) well as we go around the corner here comes ANOTHER VEHICLE IN THE OTHER FUCKING LANE, the fucking camaro slammed on its brakes and while I was still speeding up he turned very quickly to the right (behind me barely missing my vehicle) and could not keep control of his vehicle continuing on into a mailbox, completely fucking up the front of his new camaro probably something similar to this, I didn&#39;t see much because I sure as fuck wasn&#39;t sticking around for the police to come to that mess. This probably tops the most halarious things that have happened in my lifetime.


NOTE THIS IS NOT THE ACCIDENT ONLY A COMPARISON.

My friends come over with all of their cars. We’re about to go on a cruise, but then my dad comes outside to see my friend’s vette. It’s a 99’ corvette with a few bolt-ons done to it. My dad and I both know right off the bat he was bullshitting that it ran 11’s. A 99’ vette with a few bolt-ons and street tires? It’ll run mid 12’s at best. So my friend Will offers to let my dad take it for a spin. As they take off, go around the block a few times. He tells my dad his synchros might be bad. So my dad takes it down this street with a hill on it. They pull out of the neighborhood, and he gooses it a little, shifts at around 4 and half thousand. The tail starts to come out a little, so he corrects it. As he corrects it, the tire blows out. Just their luck…they hit the curb because the tail won’t come back. Then go into a uncontrolled spin and end up like this…</p>

<p>Funny thing is, insurance is only going up $100 a year for both my dad and my friend. Probably around $10-12,000 in damages.</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
why would insurance go up if the tire blew out? sounds like it wasnt his fault[/quote]<br>
coz thats how insurance works? unless it was another persons fault you claim on your own insurance so it has to go up</p>

<p>The only reasons I could see someone wanting it would be so police cameras or cars couldn’t fuck you over if you were breaking the speed limit but it’s also illegal to drive without a valid license plate.

<p>The flipper flips the plate down not replacing it, I consider that kind of pointless, the only decent one is the one with fins that makes ur plate invisible at a greater angle than the viewing angle.</p>

              <p>Um ye I think the idea is that the license plate is hidden or fake so that the camera can’t flash your real plate which identifies your car. Then if you don’t feel like speeding you show your normal plates. It is a dumb idea though, I honestly had the exact same thought when I was like 7.</p>
<p>Police would know instantly if it’s invalid, or not matching the correct car, and then you’d be fucked when you get pulled over. But then again, this is america, so the cops probably wouldn’t notice if you drew the letters on with crayons.</p>
