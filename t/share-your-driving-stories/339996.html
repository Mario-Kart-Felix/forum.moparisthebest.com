So I took that too school and on the way home today I had to slow to wait for someone to complete a turn right (mind you I am in America) the speed limit being 45, there was a brand new camaro that was a bit behind me who obviously had somekind of fucked up thinking, that most arrogant people who buy american sports cars have, that allowed his brain to trigger and say well this is a no passing zone and im going around a corner but I should go ahead and pass a mercedes benz because I want to try and prove my american vehicle superioty over the german vehicle. So he then proceeds into the left lane (right lane is normal driving lane in america) and attempts a pass around me, but what he didn’t know is that as soon as I saw him change into the other lane I slammed by fucking gas pedal as soon as the other drive turned the corner (which was a pretty quick corner turn) and im pretty sure this guy shit himself because not only is he going around a corner which he can’t see oncoming traffic, I also cut him off before he could complete a pass (I was beside him and now proceeding to pass him) well as we go around the corner here comes ANOTHER VEHICLE IN THE OTHER FUCKING LANE, the fucking camaro slammed on its brakes and while I was still speeding up he turned very quickly to the right (behind me barely missing my vehicle) and could not keep control of his vehicle continuing on into a mailbox, completely fucking up the front of his new camaro probably something similar to this, I didn’t see much because I sure as fuck wasn’t sticking around for the police to come to that mess. This probably tops the most halarious things that have happened in my lifetime.</p>

<p>Wow… Your a douche bag… Just because he’s breaking the law doesnt mean you should step in… somethin as dangerous as that could of got someone killed and if you had of just stayed at the same speed or even slowed down (Since its a hazard) it might not of happened…</p>
<p>This is why in my view British drivers are better drivers… We get tought DEFENSIVE driving… If we see a hazard then we act on it… We dont speed up and perhaps cause an accident.</p>

<p>Wow… Your a douche bag… Just because he’s breaking the law doesnt mean you should step in… somethin as dangerous as that could of got someone killed and if you had of just stayed at the same speed or even slowed down (Since its a hazard) it might not of happened…</p>
<p>This is why in my view British drivers are better drivers… We get tought DEFENSIVE driving… If we see a hazard then we act on it… We dont speed up and perhaps cause an accident.[/quote]<br>

        <p>It’s not very nice of you to do that, but fuck it. Assholes like that deserve to get crippled in a car accident. It’s quite dangerous to overtake when you’re also passing a crossroad, people who don’t understand that shouldn’t be allowed to drive in the first place.</p>

<p>If you’re on a straightaway and someone is going pretty low under the speed limit per say 10 below and you can see ahead into the other lane of traffic ahead of you, and you know that your car is faster than the person you are trying to pass, then I see no problem. But when your going to go around someone driving a mercedes benz that you only think you are faster than, also going around a heavily treeded and bushed sharp left turn with usually alot of traffic and the person ahead of you is already going 5 over the speed limit, you would be fuck stupid to try and pass because real shit like I listed above is bound to happen. Lesson taught, seems like this asshole gets a second chance, not everyone is so lucky. Now im not going to lie and say I have never made a stupid driving move since ive been driving and almost died but because of some god awesome manuevering and great breaks I survive without a scratch to self or vehicle, but I sure as hell haven’t tried to do the same thing twice because shit like that you don’t forget, also to all those who are calling me a cunt I actually thought about the outcome of if I would have just accelerated to speed limit like normal WORSE, if I would have done this the guy probably would be a bit in front of me and would have had to turn into me to get into the lane because there wouldn’t be enough time to get completely ahead of me and it would have looked like I hit him, probably fucking up my dads vehicle and who the fuck would be witness to say that it was assholes fault, at the time nobody except the one person in the other lane was there at that moment and in this town nobody sticks around to play witness. so if I would not have done what I chose to do I would be sitting here typing angry because my insurance rates just shot up, my dad cancelled my insurance so he doesnt have to pay, and a have bad mark on my license, that sounds like a great fucking alternative doesn’t it?</p>

well i’ve never seen a mailbox at the roadside in my entire life, but the uk is a lot smaller than the us so we can afford to get loads of mailmen to drive around in shitty vans hand delivering stuff to each house. we don’t get our mail on time either - for me it varies from early morning to mid-afternoon. i hurd you americans get all your mail delivered once at the same time each day.</p>
