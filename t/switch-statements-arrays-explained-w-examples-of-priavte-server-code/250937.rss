    <description>[anchor=top][b]Switch Statements, Arrays Explained![/b][/anchor]

You will learn in an in depth experience designed for those who never created one of these before.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, we will use the terminology but will explain what each means.  You&#39;ll also learn how to use the things you&#39;ve learned in this tutorial to apply it to servers.  If you have any questions or problems just post and I&#39;ll try and get back to you as soon as possible.  Just one quick note, I did post this a while ago on other sites, so if you see one from another site I can assure you that person is me.

[b][u]Switch Statements Explained:[/u][/b] [img]http://img26.picoodle.com/img/img26/3/12/16/f_1m_205ccb7.png[/img]

[anchor=ss]This[/anchor] will help you clean up your server coding, and also make it easier to add things.  Well, we aren&#39;t talking about a new file here, we&#39;re talking about adding switch statements to some things.  If you read through the whole tutorial, you will gain an understanding of switch statements and hopefully be able to implement it into your source.

What you will learn: [b]Switch Statements, Integers[/b]

Switch statement&#39;s don&#39;t need a specific file in your folder, they can be used in any java file.  They can be used wherever there is a bundle of [i]if[/i] statements.  For example, this is where you really don&#39;t need a switch statement:

[code]

		if (Example == 1) { 
			test = 1;
		}
		if (Example == 2) {
			test = 2;
		} else {
			test = 3;
		}[/code]

Let&#39;s say you had a couple more, then it would be a better idea to use a switch statement.

[code]
		if (Example == 1) { 
			test = 1;
		}
		if (Example == 2) {
			test = 2;
		}
		if (Example == 3) {
			test = 3;
		}
		if (Example == 4) {
			test = 4;
		}
		if (Example == 5) {
			test = 5;
		} else {
			test = 3;
		}[/code]

Alright, now that you&#39;ve distinguished where a switch statement is needed, and where it is not, lets teach you!
Before we get off, I&#39;d like to note that switch statements can only be used with integers and enumerations.  (Integers can hold numbers only!)
But for now, we&#39;ll focus on integer statements.  

We always begin with this:

[code]switch (intName) {[/code]

You would write [i]switch[/i] and then begin to write the integers name you want to be in the switch statement.  Now, what makes this even more different then [i]if[/i] statements is that the integers value&#39;s are represented as:

[code]case 1:[/code]
(Quick explanation: 1 represents the integers&#39; value.)

So an example of a small switch statement:

[code]switch (intName) { //Begins the switch statement

  case 1: //The one stands for the integers value
    sendMessage(&quot;Hello, my young fellow!&quot;); //If the integer is equal to one, it would send this message
    break; //Breaks the code, so it doesn&#39;t &quot;over flow&quot; 
  case 2: //The two stands for the integers value
    sendMessage(&quot;Hello, my young man!&quot;); //If the integer is equal to two, it would send this message
    break; //Breaks the code, so it doesn&#39;t &quot;over flow&quot; 

} //Closing bracket ending the switch statement[/code]

But let&#39;s say there were five unique statements on integers [i]1[/i] to [i]5[/i], but then the rest were the same.
That&#39;s where the [i]default:[/i] comes in handy. 

[code]default: //If you didn&#39;t supply the integers value in the switch statement, it will go to this!
  sendMessage(&quot;I won&#39;t do that!&quot;); //Sends a message
  break; //Breaks so it wont &quot;over flow&quot;[/code] 

Alright, now that I&#39;ve fed you with the information needed to start coding, I&#39;ll give you an example of using one of these in a source.  

I&#39;ll begin in the [i]client class[/i] in packet 155.  (First click NPC) 

[code]switch (NPCID) {
				
	case 2: //Npc ID
	  updateNeeded = true;
	  NpcWanneTalk = 754;
	  break;
	case 222: //Npc ID
	  updateNeeded = true;
	  NpcWanneTalk = 222;
	  break;
	
	default: //If the ID is supported in this statement, it&#39;ll do this...
	  println(&quot;[Packet 155] Npc Isn&#39;t Supported!&quot;);
	  break;

}[/code]

You see, I&#39;ve added a couple Npc examples to get you going.  You can start by creating your very own switch statement!  Notice that I&#39;ve added a default statement?  I did that because I&#39;m expecting that there would be many more Npcs to come and that if you ever wanted to know if it wasn&#39;t already in the switch statement, it would print the line in your [i]run.bat[/i].

[b][u]Arrays Explained Tutorial:[/u][/b] [img]http://img26.picoodle.com/img/img26/3/12/16/f_1m_205ccb7.png[/img]

[anchor=s1]This[/anchor] will teach you how to add a new file to your server which will handle specifically arrays. Although this isn&#39;t the best of an idea, this is just an example - and if you read through this whole tutorial, you could actually learn something.  But some may not know what an Array is?

[i]Definition:[/i]
&lt;blockquote&gt;An array is a variable that holds multiple values of the same type.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

What you will learn: Arrays, Integers, Static Methods, Creating a file.
Now, perhaps some wonder if this is a Java tutorial or even a server tutorial.  The truth is, it&#39;s kind of both.

Lets start by creating a new file.
Every file must begin with:

[code]public class [/code]
We will make this file public because we want it to be seen by other files.  If what so ever you don&#39;t, then you would make it private.  

Let&#39;s begin to add the first line to the file:

[code]public class ClientArray {[/code]

As you can see, you already know what the file will be called.  ([i]ClientArray[/i]).  I&#39;ve named it that because this file will only handle arrays from the client class.  If you want to modify it, you can change the name.

Although there isn&#39;t much to this file, I&#39;ll assume that most sources have at least one array already built.

[anchor=middle]Lets[/anchor] begin to add this, don&#39;t worry - it&#39;ll change just a bit but it won&#39;t give us errors.

[code]public static final int PACKET_SIZES[] = {[/code]

You may wonder why it&#39;s in captials this time?
Well, the proper way to do it is whenever a constant is equal to &#39;public static final&#39;, the value should be in capitals.

This isn&#39;t full, but already it tells us that this array will hold integers (numbers), and is static.  (Although, static can only be called to a static, this will ease things up by just referring to the class, then method.  

Anyways, the full method is this:

[code]
	public static final int PACKET_SIZES[] = {
		0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, //0
		0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 6, 2, 2, 0,  //10
		0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, //20
		0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2,  //30
		2, 6, 0, 6, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, //40
		0, 0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, //50
		0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  //60
		6, 0, 2, 2, 8, 6, 0, -1, 0, 6, //70
		0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 6, 0, 0,  //80
		0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, -1, 0, //90
		0, 13, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,//100
		0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0,  //110
		1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 2, 6, //120
		0, 4, 6, 8, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2,  //130
		0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0,  //140
		0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0,  //150
		0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0,//160
		0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  //170
		0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 1,  //180
		0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, //190
		2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0,  //200
		4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0, 10, 0, //210
		0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 6, 0, //220
		1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 8, 1, 0,  //230
		0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, -1, 4,//240
		0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0            //250
	};[/code]

Now, we are missing one bracket to end the file.
So, at the end of the file, add one more bracket.

[code]}[/code]

Now, this is the time where we delete this array from the client class.
In [i]client.java[/i], find this:

[code]public static final int packetSizes[] = {[/code]

Erase the whole thing, as we added it to the file we&#39;ve just created.
But it still won&#39;t work yet, since we&#39;ve erased it, the method that calls it doesn&#39;t know where it is.

So in the same file, search for: 

[code]packetSizes[/code]

You will only get one search result for that.
Now, replace &#39;packetSizes&#39; with:

[code]ClientArray.PACKET_SIZES[/code]

We add this because it will tell the file to go to ClientArray.PACKET_SIZES.
As said before, we need to first give the Class we are going in, and the methods name.

([i]For those who don&#39;t know what the line should look like, here it is:[/i])

[code]PACKET_SIZES = ClientArray.PACKET_SIZES[packetType];[/code]

Alright, but let&#39;s say you wanted to create your own array, not just take from whats already there.
As said before, arrays can hold multiple values. 

But lets focus on the arrays that hold integers (numbers). 
If you&#39;re adding for the file we&#39;ve created, then it would look like this:

[code]public static int[] example =  {[/code]

If your doing something for the client class, then it wouldn&#39;t need a static.

[code]public int[] example =  {[/code]

Let&#39;s say that we wanted this array to represent untradable items.
Well, what we would first have to do for the array, is add some numbers.

But we can&#39;t tell an array what the numbers mean, we can just add the values.

[i]Example for the static array:[/i]
[code]
	public static int[] untradable = {  //Example 
		1507, 995
	};[/code]
[i]Example for the non-static array:[/i]
[code]
	public int[] untradable = {  //Example 
		1507, 995
	};[/code]

For those who are in [i]ClientArray.java[/i], you can close it and open up [i]Client.java[/i].  And those who did this example in [i]Client.java[/i], well - you&#39;re in the right place.

As I said before, we are doing &#39;untradable items&#39; as an example.
We&#39;ll have to create a new method, so at the end of the file but before the last bracket add this:

[code]public boolean isUntradable(int item) {
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; ClientArray.untradable.length; i++) {
   if(ClientArray.untradable[i] == item)
    return true;
  }
 return false;
}[/code]

Maybe in my next lesson I&#39;ll go a bit further off topic from Array&#39;s, but lets focus on this stuff first.
By looking at this method, already you might have guessed that it has something to do with going into the ClientArray class, and going to the untradable method.  

[i](How do you know?)[/i]
[code]ClientArray.untradable.length[/code]

Well, it first sets an integer to 0, but any number that is higher then what we&#39;ve added in the array, it&#39;ll then do:

[code]if(ClientArray.untradable[i] == item)[/code]

What that means is basically, if any number from the array equals an items ID number, then it will return a true statement.  And in this example, if it&#39;s true - then the item is untradable, if it&#39;s false then it isn&#39;t.

Alright, now you&#39;ve created your own array, but now its your turn to call upon the method. (isUntradable) 
Anyways, good luck with this - and I hope you learned something new.

[i]Examples of an array in crafting:[/i]

[code]	int[]reqLvl =  { //Required levels for crafting this add: Requried Level
		2, 1 
	};
	int[]neededGem =  { //Gems you need to craft it add: Item ID
		1615, 1617 
	};
	int[]givenResult =  { //What you&#39;ll get once you craft  it add: Item ID
		1617, 1619 
	};
	int[]expGiven =  { //And the exp given  add: EXP given 
		32, 66 
	};
		
		 for (int h = 0; h &lt; reqLvl.length; h++) {
			if (playerHasItem(neededGem[h], 1) &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(1755, 1) &amp;&amp; (itemUsed == 1755 &amp;&amp; useWith == neededGem[h])) {
				if (playerLevel[playerCrafting] &lt; reqLvl[h]) {
					sendMessage(&quot;You need a level of &quot;+reqLvl[h]+&quot; to craft that!&quot;);
					break;
				}
                                sendMessage(&quot;You craft the &quot;+neededGem+&quot;.&quot;);
				setAnimation(885);
				deleteItem(neededGem[h], 1); //Deletes the neededgem
				addItem(givenResult[h], 1); //Gives item
				addSkillXP(expGiven[h], 12); //Gives EXP
				animationReset = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1000;
				break;
			}
		}[/code]

<p>You will learn in an in depth experience designed for those who never created one of these before.  Don’t get me wrong, we will use the terminology but will explain what each means.  You’ll also learn how to use the things you’ve learned in this tutorial to apply it to servers.  If you have any questions or problems just post and I’ll try and get back to you as soon as possible.  Just one quick note, I did post this a while ago on other sites, so if you see one from another site I can assure you that person is me.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Switch Statements Explained:</span></span> <img src="http://img26.picoodle.com/img/img26/3/12/16/f_1m_205ccb7.png" alt width="153" height="45"></p>
<p>[anchor=ss]This[/anchor] will help you clean up your server coding, and also make it easier to add things.  Well, we aren’t talking about a new file here, we’re talking about adding switch statements to some things.  If you read through the whole tutorial, you will gain an understanding of switch statements and hopefully be able to implement it into your source.</p>
<p>What you will learn: <span class="bbcode-b">Switch Statements, Integers</span></p>
<p>Switch statement’s don’t need a specific file in your folder, they can be used in any java file.  They can be used wherever there is a bundle of <span class="bbcode-i">if</span> statements.  For example, this is where you really don’t need a switch statement:</p>
<p>[code]</p>
<pre><code>	if (Example == 1) { 
		test = 1;
	}
	if (Example == 2) {
		test = 2;
	} else {
		test = 3;
	}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s say you had a couple more, then it would be a better idea to use a switch statement.</p>
<p><code>
		if (Example == 1) { 
			test = 1;
		}
		if (Example == 2) {
			test = 2;
		}
		if (Example == 3) {
			test = 3;
		}
		if (Example == 4) {
			test = 4;
		}
		if (Example == 5) {
			test = 5;
		} else {
			test = 3;
		}</code></p>
<p>Alright, now that you’ve distinguished where a switch statement is needed, and where it is not, lets teach you!<br>
Before we get off, I’d like to note that switch statements can only be used with integers and enumerations.  (Integers can hold numbers only!)<br>
But for now, we’ll focus on integer statements.</p>
<p>We always begin with this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">switch (intName) {</code></pre>
<p>You would write <span class="bbcode-i">switch</span> and then begin to write the integers name you want to be in the switch statement.  Now, what makes this even more different then <span class="bbcode-i">if</span> statements is that the integers value’s are represented as:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">case 1:</code></pre>
<p>(Quick explanation: 1 represents the integers’ value.)</p>
<p>So an example of a small switch statement:</p>
<p>[code]switch (intName) { //Begins the switch statement</p>
<p>case 1: //The one stands for the integers value<br>
sendMessage(“Hello, my young fellow!”); //If the integer is equal to one, it would send this message<br>
break; //Breaks the code, so it doesn’t “over flow”<br>
case 2: //The two stands for the integers value<br>
sendMessage(“Hello, my young man!”); //If the integer is equal to two, it would send this message<br>
break; //Breaks the code, so it doesn’t “over flow”</p>
<p>} //Closing bracket ending the switch statement[/code]</p>
<p>But let’s say there were five unique statements on integers <span class="bbcode-i">1</span> to <span class="bbcode-i">5</span>, but then the rest were the same.<br>
That’s where the <span class="bbcode-i">default:</span> comes in handy.</p>
<p><code>default: //If you didn't supply the integers value in the switch statement, it will go to this!
  sendMessage("I won't do that!"); //Sends a message
  break; //Breaks so it wont "over flow"</code></p>
<p>Alright, now that I’ve fed you with the information needed to start coding, I’ll give you an example of using one of these in a source.</p>
<p>I’ll begin in the <span class="bbcode-i">client class</span> in packet 155.  (First click NPC)</p>
<p>[code]switch (NPCID) {</p>
<pre><code>case 2: //Npc ID
  updateNeeded = true;
  NpcWanneTalk = 754;
  break;
case 222: //Npc ID
  updateNeeded = true;
  NpcWanneTalk = 222;
  break;

default: //If the ID is supported in this statement, it'll do this...
  println("[Packet 155] Npc Isn't Supported!");
  break;
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>You see, I’ve added a couple Npc examples to get you going.  You can start by creating your very own switch statement!  Notice that I’ve added a default statement?  I did that because I’m expecting that there would be many more Npcs to come and that if you ever wanted to know if it wasn’t already in the switch statement, it would print the line in your <span class="bbcode-i">run.bat</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Arrays Explained Tutorial:</span></span> <img src="http://img26.picoodle.com/img/img26/3/12/16/f_1m_205ccb7.png" alt width="153" height="45"></p>
<p>[anchor=s1]This[/anchor] will teach you how to add a new file to your server which will handle specifically arrays. Although this isn’t the best of an idea, this is just an example - and if you read through this whole tutorial, you could actually learn something.  But some may not know what an Array is?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Definition:</span></p>
<blockquote>An array is a variable that holds multiple values of the same type.</blockquote>
<p>What you will learn: Arrays, Integers, Static Methods, Creating a file.<br>
Now, perhaps some wonder if this is a Java tutorial or even a server tutorial.  The truth is, it’s kind of both.</p>
<p>Lets start by creating a new file.<br>
Every file must begin with:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class </code></pre>
<p>We will make this file public because we want it to be seen by other files.  If what so ever you don’t, then you would make it private.</p>
<p>Let’s begin to add the first line to the file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class ClientArray {</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, you already know what the file will be called.  (<span class="bbcode-i">ClientArray</span>).  I’ve named it that because this file will only handle arrays from the client class.  If you want to modify it, you can change the name.</p>
<p>Although there isn’t much to this file, I’ll assume that most sources have at least one array already built.</p>
<p>[anchor=middle]Lets[/anchor] begin to add this, don’t worry - it’ll change just a bit but it won’t give us errors.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public static final int PACKET_SIZES[] = {</code></pre>
<p>You may wonder why it’s in captials this time?<br>
Well, the proper way to do it is whenever a constant is equal to ‘public static final’, the value should be in capitals.</p>
<p>This isn’t full, but already it tells us that this array will hold integers (numbers), and is static.  (Although, static can only be called to a static, this will ease things up by just referring to the class, then method.</p>
<p>Anyways, the full method is this:</p>
<p><code>
	public static final int PACKET_SIZES[] = {
		0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, //0
		0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 6, 2, 2, 0,  //10
		0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, //20
		0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2,  //30
		2, 6, 0, 6, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, //40
		0, 0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, //50
		0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  //60
		6, 0, 2, 2, 8, 6, 0, -1, 0, 6, //70
		0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 6, 0, 0,  //80
		0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, -1, 0, //90
		0, 13, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,//100
		0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0,  //110
		1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 2, 6, //120
		0, 4, 6, 8, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2,  //130
		0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0,  //140
		0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0,  //150
		0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0,//160
		0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,  //170
		0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 1,  //180
		0, 0, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, //190
		2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0,  //200
		4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 8, 0, 0, 10, 0, //210
		0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 6, 0, //220
		1, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6, 8, 1, 0,  //230
		0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0, -1, 4,//240
		0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0            //250
	};</code></p>
<p>Now, we are missing one bracket to end the file.<br>
So, at the end of the file, add one more bracket.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">}</code></pre>
<p>Now, this is the time where we delete this array from the client class.<br>
In <span class="bbcode-i">client.java</span>, find this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public static final int packetSizes[] = {</code></pre>
<p>Erase the whole thing, as we added it to the file we’ve just created.<br>
But it still won’t work yet, since we’ve erased it, the method that calls it doesn’t know where it is.</p>
<p>So in the same file, search for:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">packetSizes</code></pre>
<p>You will only get one search result for that.<br>
Now, replace ‘packetSizes’ with:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ClientArray.PACKET_SIZES</code></pre>
<p>We add this because it will tell the file to go to ClientArray.PACKET_SIZES.<br>
As said before, we need to first give the Class we are going in, and the methods name.</p>
<p>(<span class="bbcode-i">For those who don’t know what the line should look like, here it is:</span>)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">PACKET_SIZES = ClientArray.PACKET_SIZES[packetType];</code></pre>
<p>Alright, but let’s say you wanted to create your own array, not just take from whats already there.<br>
As said before, arrays can hold multiple values.</p>
<p>But lets focus on the arrays that hold integers (numbers).<br>
If you’re adding for the file we’ve created, then it would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public static int[] example =  {</code></pre>
<p>If your doing something for the client class, then it wouldn’t need a static.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int[] example =  {</code></pre>
<p>Let’s say that we wanted this array to represent untradable items.<br>
Well, what we would first have to do for the array, is add some numbers.</p>
<p>But we can’t tell an array what the numbers mean, we can just add the values.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Example for the static array:</span></p>
<p><code>
	public static int[] untradable = {  //Example 
		1507, 995
	};</code><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Example for the non-static array:</span></p>
<p><code>
	public int[] untradable = {  //Example 
		1507, 995
	};</code></p>
<p>For those who are in <span class="bbcode-i">ClientArray.java</span>, you can close it and open up <span class="bbcode-i">Client.java</span>.  And those who did this example in <span class="bbcode-i">Client.java</span>, well - you’re in the right place.</p>
<p>As I said before, we are doing ‘untradable items’ as an example.<br>
We’ll have to create a new method, so at the end of the file but before the last bracket add this:</p>
<p><code>public boolean isUntradable(int item) {
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; ClientArray.untradable.length; i++) {
   if(ClientArray.untradable[i] == item)
    return true;
  }
 return false;
}</code></p>
<p>Maybe in my next lesson I’ll go a bit further off topic from Array’s, but lets focus on this stuff first.<br>
By looking at this method, already you might have guessed that it has something to do with going into the ClientArray class, and going to the untradable method.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">(How do you know?)</span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ClientArray.untradable.length</code></pre>
<p>Well, it first sets an integer to 0, but any number that is higher then what we’ve added in the array, it’ll then do:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(ClientArray.untradable[i] == item)</code></pre>
<p>What that means is basically, if any number from the array equals an items ID number, then it will return a true statement.  And in this example, if it’s true - then the item is untradable, if it’s false then it isn’t.</p>
<p>Alright, now you’ve created your own array, but now its your turn to call upon the method. (isUntradable)<br>
Anyways, good luck with this - and I hope you learned something new.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Examples of an array in crafting:</span></p>
<p>[code]	int[]reqLvl =  { //Required levels for crafting this add: Requried Level<br>
2, 1<br>
};<br>
int[]neededGem =  { //Gems you need to craft it add: Item ID<br>
1615, 1617<br>
};<br>
int[]givenResult =  { //What you’ll get once you craft  it add: Item ID<br>
1617, 1619<br>
};<br>
int[]expGiven =  { //And the exp given  add: EXP given<br>
32, 66<br>
};</p>
<pre><code>	 for (int h = 0; h &lt; reqLvl.length; h++) {
		if (playerHasItem(neededGem[h], 1) &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(1755, 1) &amp;&amp; (itemUsed == 1755 &amp;&amp; useWith == neededGem[h])) {
			if (playerLevel[playerCrafting] &lt; reqLvl[h]) {
				sendMessage("You need a level of "+reqLvl[h]+" to craft that!");
				break;
			}
                            sendMessage("You craft the "+neededGem+".");
			setAnimation(885);
			deleteItem(neededGem[h], 1); //Deletes the neededgem
			addItem(givenResult[h], 1); //Gives item
			addSkillXP(expGiven[h], 12); //Gives EXP
			animationReset = System.currentTimeMillis() + 1000;
			break;
		}
