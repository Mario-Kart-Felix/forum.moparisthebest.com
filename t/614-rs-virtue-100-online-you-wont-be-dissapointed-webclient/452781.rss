Well, I’m not going to watch the video, I’d prefer pictures. Those forums looks nice though, like em’ a lot.<br>
[/quote]Forums are always a major factor for you huh? ;D[/quote]<br>
Yes, I find them as a first-impression, if I don’t like the forums, I don’t like the entire thing.</p>
<p>OT: So, I forced myself to watch the video and it was BASICALLY dueling, it doesn’t seem so appealing but at least the forums are nice haha.</p>
