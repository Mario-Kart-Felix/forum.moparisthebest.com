    <title>Need 1 more coder for a large new project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-1-more-coder-for-a-large-new-project/545168</link>
    <description>The reason I am coming to you today is to search for a team of dedicated, experienced java coders, also someone experienced with both java and php for server- website related configurations.
All expenses regarding hosting of the ddos-protected server, web host, and domain are taken care of.
We have purchased the server, domain, web hosting, email platform, and an ipb license.
I am looking to start up a large scale server, of the 317 revision. 
When joining this project you ARE joining as an owner, and everyone on the team has an equal say as to what we do [including equally split profits]
Some info of the server:
- Custom G.E 90% (just waiting on client dev)
-Perfect PvP combat switching and combo&#39;s
-Every Skill working
-All skill&#39;s have their own areas to train
-Many stable ways to make money
-9 Boss&#39;s all with perfect drop rate&#39;s
-New Armors/Weapons
-6 Fully Working Minigames featuring
-Great PKing areas
-Clipped NPCs&#39;/Following/Attacking
-Adding Auto Donations
-Adding Auto Vote4Cash (3.5M ea)
-Adding Highscore&#39;s on website
-Working on nice website.
If you are interested you must contact me via skype: Microchip1233
This server is the REAL DEAL, and we are only seeking serious applicants.
Thank You, Harrison.
Update:
Have 1 good member on the team for server sided work excluding myself, and we have an exceptional gfx designer. We need 1 more coder for the server/client+ good at php.
Thanks again.</description>
