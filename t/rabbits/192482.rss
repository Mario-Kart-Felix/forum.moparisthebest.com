              <p>[quote=“bootnecklad, post:1, topic:192482”]Well It all started when…</p>
<p>It was a bright end of August 2007 and school was coming near, pets were outside and the birds sat in there nets tweeting to the hearts content, My guinea pigs had died in December 2006 and January 2007 and our friends had rabbit problems, My brother and sister love rabbits, so in the middle of September Arrived two Lion head rabbits the adults talked and my sibilings adored the rabbits, the stroked them and well all was well till October. The weather had declined so we took the rabbits from there hutch and placed them in their cage in the warm corner of the computer room. All was merry until one fine November day, the rabbits were shagging left right and center. We checked the rabbits for their sex, two girls we were told to have. It didn’t really seem like it. When Christmas was upon us The rabbits had departed outside again to there hutch when about one week before Christmas day I was huddled around the cage and shown 3 little kittens, mother rabbit had given birth, a good day it was until the bad news was said, “A litter of 5, now a litter of 3.”</p>
<p>One rabbit was so small it couldn’t survive, it died. Another rabbit had what seemed to be a bite mark on the head, it was found outside the cage, bigger than the first one but died from the cold. The last kitten wasn’t so healthy, small enough to fall from the bars of the hutch, it fell onto the decking, we tried to keep it going, warmed it up and did our best, 2 what seemed healthy rabbits and one not so right, Our mummy rabbit was a good mummy she protected her kittens and fed them when needed. We had separated the two original rabbits so dad wouldn’t try to kill the babys although mum had either stopped him or he was a good daddy rabbit. The sick baby rabbit departed in the next few hours, so with 3 deceased rabbits off My dad went to burry them in the woods. Checking each set of rabbits every few hours it seemed daddy rabbit got depressed. The two kittens we called the terrible twins on Christmas day.</p>
<p>Everything was running smoothly the twins taking there first steps, mum still feeding them then one bitter cold  school morning everybody got ready not knowing what would happen later that day. In a maths lesson I was in I felt my phone vibrate, ahhhhh. I could help my self I still have to get used to my phone vibrating in my pocket, “EEEEPPP!” Everyone turned round and stared. Think of something, quickly… I looked out the windows and everyone followed my eyes, it was raining, and? Then it was hailing, everyone rushed to the windows bingo, I check my phone and had a text. " More baby rabbits arrived" I was happy for the rest of the day. When I got home I saw 3 areas in the indoor cage, Mummy rabbit was sleeping, the twins were eating and there was a small pile of straw in one corner. I checked it and 4 little kittens were lying there, I put my finger out and the cute little things got up and seemed like they wanted more milk from their mummy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Later that day my mum brought home a cage for the twins to go in so they wouldn’t kill the kittens or hog the milk for them. We watched them grow take the steps, IN this second litter there was 5 to start with, the forth was dead when it came out oh well, out dad went with the shovel.</p>
<p>Yesterday we gave The Twins  another one of our friends, she loves them I forget there names but since February every week her and her husband (bloody Turkish no offense to anyone here) to build there hutch (I’ll get picks later) and about 3 weeks ago Daddy rabbit went to the vets. Today they got reunited finally, we watched for 5 minutes as they ate the grass in there run and saw each other, ah. They had it th wrong way round, When I started typing this they just started, and there still at it. so on the calender about 4 weeks from now it says ‘Rabbits?’ So we could have more.[/quote]</p>
<p>Eh… what?</p>
