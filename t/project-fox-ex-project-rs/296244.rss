    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-fox-ex-project-rs/296244</link>
    <description>update as of oct 24; updated post..


Okay, my tutorial server wasn&#39;t as great as it could of been because of multiple issues I found such as doors.JAVA instead of a .CFG.

So, I figured I&#39;d do all the hard work and just release an economy server (as I tend to do), this server is using the same base as the tutorial server I was making, the economy will be strong and I will be releasing parts of it until it reaches the point I want to stop and make it my own little unique server.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[center]Information:
Source: Figment F2p (Czar)
Server type: Skilling, Pking. maybe quests when I can be bothered to add them
Economy Strength?: Strong when it&#39;s complete.
What will the exp be?: So far this is it;

note: the empty ones are either not added or have no exp yet

All rates are made by Runescapes experiance multiplyed by the numbers shown.


 Stat | Rate
Combat: 36x
Hitpoints: 36x
Magic: 12x (I like hard magic)
Prayer: 10x (causes a bone-economy)
Runecrafting:
Agility: 7x
Herblore:
Thieving:
Crafting:
Fletching:
Slayer:
Mining:
Smithing: 7x (10x was too much. 5x too little.)
Fishing:
Cooking:
Firemaking: 3x (10X means only 10k willows needed, bad for leveling)
Woodcutting: 5x (slightly better then FM)
Farming:


Updates:
Doors added on tut.isle
Shops added, soon to be 100% done
NPC Drops started thanks to Jeddac
Agility base added &lt;3 (pic coming soon)
Camelot tele added.
Teletabs started, models added to the client &lt;3
Glory added, soon ring of duel.
all of Varrocks shops are 100% runescape
Magic exp on the teleports X by 12 now
Arrows now show the exact amount that you are wielding, beforehand it only displayed the item&#39;s ID, before that it showed &quot;190&quot;
Wildy levels being worked on right now
Ardoungne teleport added
Added 100% Climbing boots from Tenzing, same place as RuneScape.
Teletabs finished.
Teleports being a bit nerfed so you dont glitch when in combat
Food 100% up until 377 food, jublys and monkfish included.
Fishing started.
Clues also started, very basic; but effective.
Potions being re-done.
Added agility shortcuts to some areas, just need to add some emotes.
[s]Arrows will delete on use when I compile next.[/s]
Farming base made: probably exactly like delta&#39;s, very basic use item on object, show emote and give an item.
[s]Adding poison.[/s]
Some npcs added, npc drops done.
Magic should be able to use staffs, combo runes(steam, mud, ect) and basic runes if magic is handled in client.java (there&#39;s no .cfg ;))
Wildy is now ONLY in the wilderness, I&#39;m pretty sure i got 100% of the wildy areas covered. levels still dont work
Enchant spells work now, 95%, only thing missing is the GFX and onyx&#39;s magic. The exp is handled by ServerCP.
Gem crafting added, correct levels and emotes; only thing missing is onyx cut.
Adding amulet crafting to go with the enchant.
Doors to alkharid and Varrock Hillgiants require correct items and sendmessage.
Potions no longer give 137 in each stat, regulars give 111 and supers give 117, pic being uploaded.
[s]For some reason it doesn&#39;t matter which clue you&#39;re doing it will delete all previous scrolls you might of used.[/s]
Clue scrolls no longer delete previous scrolls.
Wc speeds put in ServerCP to adjust economy.
Mining also in ServerCP.
Arrow handler is now in ServerCP to take out the dropping if the duping shits me.
Potions are being worked on and handled by ServerCP.
Weapon poisoning by means of poison&gt;items is started. So far DD (clean) has all its poisons.



Areas finished:
Lummy
Fally
Varrock

Teleports added:
Varrock
Fally
Lummy
Ardy
Cammy
Paddewa &lt;-- added because I was sick of searching for edge&#39;s fricking coods lol.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/center]


The main idea of this server is to bring back 2005 and replicate RuneScape as much as I can. By which I mean basically everything will be close to RuneScape, purchasing climbing boots will be the same, prayer book&#39;s will be the same, even my method of Barrows fixing I used in Delta as a test will be the same.

The economy will be a very tight and strict made one, admins will not be able to spawn ect, including myself.

Here&#39;s a little bit of an example at NPC drop system and why this server has the best economy compatibility.
[code]1=558,9-9,1:50;[/code]

Unlike most server&#39;s this can have a 1 in a [b]Billion[/b] chance and drop between lowest:highest causing such a great drop economy like runescapes.


So far, here&#39;s some pictures:

Some proof this isn&#39;t a DeltaScape server;
[URL=http://img24.imageshack.us/i/nondeltalol.png/][IMG]http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/1562/nondeltalol.png[/img][/URL]
Notice Server.CP and doors.JAVA?

NPC drop&#39;s file to show how much strength can be in the economy

If you&#39;d like to join or support, post here or add my msn. I&#39;m open to all suggestions and help seeing as this server is in my hopes going to bring the RSPS economys up because really.. start with 10m, buy items worth 300m.. what&#39;s the differance from 10 gp and 300k in that case?
Strong economys with slow training is the way to go.



------------

Client work;

Okay, I just started this. Mainly some sprite re-doing so far. Hp bar will be differant to 317, but no RS&#39;s. I plan on using the HP bar from CNC3 (Command and Conquer 3)

Chatbox sprites changed a little bit. nothing major.</description>

<p>anyway, this server isn’t crammed with shit; it’s about 5 - 10% more stable then Delta servers are- though this doesnt have as much features or anything.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 05, 2009, 03:22:06 am[/size][hr][quote=“the elve age, post:41, topic:296244”]Thats a delta.

<p>nah man, that’s just the cache. take a look at the server I released a few months ago, you’ll see :P, I use Webbers’ client for coding as it does almost the exact same thing as Silab and Mopar; though it was made for a Deltascape server. Don’t judge a server by it’s client :P[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 05, 2009, 03:23:29 am[/size][hr][quote=“runeite51, post:42, topic:296244”]i’m your guy for finding glitches, even the best coded servers I almost  ALWAYS manage to find glitches… including runescpe itself…[/quote]</p>
<p>accepted your add on msn. server won’t be up for another week though, I’m getting another connection cabel added in my room so I don’t need to be slaved from the family computor room preventing pf issues.</p>
