        <p>40 ranged and magic at the same time for a pure? I smell failure. Any pure that decided to go straight range would kill a 40 range/40 magic hybrid combo. How many times do I gotta tell these people, pure is sticking to 1 fighting style. Being hybrid is great, it gives you a special edge the other pure may not have. But, if you plan to be hybrid, why ruin yourself so low? If you plan to be hybrid, play it smart.</p>
<p>Get 60-70 ranged, pure. Stick with ranged souly as long as possibly. When you feel the time is finally right, get some quick magic levels. Don‚Äôt cut short, because you‚Äôll regret it. Go for what you‚Äôre going for. You want 90 ranged and 82 magic? Get 70 ranged, then 60 magic, then 80 ranged and 70 magic, then 90 ranged and 82 magic. It will control your combat to stay low, while being able to at least fight with a skill that means something(range).</p>

        <p>[quote=‚Äúexe626, post:2, topic:180175‚Äù]40 ranged and magic at the same time for a pure? I smell failure. Any pure that decided to go straight range would kill a 40 range/40 magic hybrid combo. How many times do I gotta tell these people, pure is sticking to 1 fighting style. Being hybrid is great, it gives you a special edge the other pure may not have. But, if you plan to be hybrid, why ruin yourself so low? If you plan to be hybrid, play it smart.</p>
<p>Get 60-70 ranged, pure. Stick with ranged souly as long as possibly. When you feel the time is finally right, get some quick magic levels. Don‚Äôt cut short, because you‚Äôll regret it. Go for what you‚Äôre going for. You want 90 ranged and 82 magic? Get 70 ranged, then 60 magic, then 80 ranged and 70 magic, then 90 ranged and 82 magic. It will control your combat to stay low, while being able to at least fight with a skill that means something(range).[/quote]<br>
best hybrid i have ever seen had 60 range 88 str 1 att 1 def‚Ä¶ range until low whip out obby maul. level 56 combat or something like that‚Ä¶</p>

<p>From personal experience, planning and then ‚Äúhelping‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work. Neither does ‚Äúgetting round to it‚Äù. No, you either plan and do or do not at all.[/quote]</p>
