    <title>PK Point shop instead of using coins</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-point-shop-instead-of-using-coins/361253</link>
    <description>i&#39;m using the demise pking source and client, which is a delta base, and it already has a pk store. it uses kills to buy items not money as currency. where would i look to change an items currency from money/default to pk points? i know how to make each item worth so many kills, but if i only put an item, for example rune platebody, as 5 kills, it still takes the default/money currency instead of pk points? any ideas :s? thanks.</description>
