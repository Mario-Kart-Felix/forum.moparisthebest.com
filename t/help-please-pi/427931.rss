    <description>Help help help I add a button on my server what i want this button to do is the follow.

1. If you have less than 300 donator points. it sends a message saying you have to have 300 donator credits to get this status.. // I know how do that i&#39;m pretty sure.

2. make so if you have more than 300 donator credits a option thing will show up asking if you would like this status option being yes or no.. if they pick yes there isDonator = 1 and it will remove 300 of your donator points. so how can i do this I know i have to add this in clickingbuttons.java but i dont know how to make the code!

 thanks!!!!</description>

              <p>thank you very much but I found a much better way i’m going to hard-code a item like a piece of paper and rename it Super status… and put it in a shop where people can buy it for 400 donator points. then they talk to a npc that will ask them if they like to trade it in for super status lol. I know how to code that in lol… but!</p>
<p>really thanks for taking the time to help me!!! &lt;3</p>

              <p>jeezes fuck this will be hard to make</p>
<p>add this in the umm click button. you log into your server click the button, go to your cmd and look at the action button that comes up. after that you need to go to clickbutton and creat a new class such as</p>
<p><code>case buttonid:
put next code in here
break;</code></p>
<p>then add this in it</p>
<p><code>if (isDonatorns &lt; 300){
</code><br>
here u have two options if you want an actual dialogue box to show up do this</p>
<p>go to dialoguehandler.java and find an empty case such as case 99: or sumtin</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">case ID:
sendStatement("You have to have 300 donator credits to get this status..");
c.nextChat = 0;
break;	</code></pre>
<p>then go back to the clickbutton file and finish off the code with this</p>
<p>[code]c.getDH().sendDialogues(ID, npcType);<br>
}<br>
else if (isDonatorns &gt;= 300){<br>
c.isDonator = 1;<br>
}</p>
<p>idk i give up too long work off of that but i think clickbutton is actuial actionhandler<br>
[/code]</p>
