Created a Project thread and receiving great feed back

I&#39;d like it to be supported by a competent team of developers. [b][u][size=18pt]This project is being written on the hyperion frame work not project insanity [/size][/u][/b]


Website Developer:

You&#39;ll be required to build a website for the server, forums, embedding webclient&#39;s, general website maintenance and additions and have a large role in server to website integration so programming knowledge will be necessary, mainly in databases, sql / php and some java. Not a comprehensive knowledge of PHP and Java is required. 

Graphics designer: Will be in charge of making banners and layout of designs for client developers to work from and also help website developer with creating graphics for the website itself

Item modeler: Someone who is good at modeling and enjoys it and would love to create models for a new upcoming game 


Server Developers:

You must know Java extensively, and have a relatively good understanding of how RSPS works. It would be beneficial if you had an understanding of any scripting languages, especially Ruby and/or Python as these languages may come into use later down the line of development. Of course content building and upgrading will be required and general debugging in the hosting stages.

Client Developer: Searching for multiple Client Developer&#39;s to help client developing move along quicker than one person working seperatly alone.

Again pretty much the same requirements as the server developers, you should also be able to effectively modify a Rsps client, edit maps, models, loading screens, creating interfaces. There could also be some communication with the website
