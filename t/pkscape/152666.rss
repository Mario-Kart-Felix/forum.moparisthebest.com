<p>I am using this name for my server, but the good no-ip’s are good. My server ip will just be <a href="http://pktothedeath.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">pktothedeath.no-ip.org</a> when it is ready. Mine is specifically titled “PKScape” with the capitals lol.</p>

              <p>well this is the thing the java codeing and what we are all talking about is created with a totely difftent program then the models in cache so it really depends if we could make a program that could decompile and recompile the cache parts we could make a list of wounderfully odd items and idk maybe some custom items all depends if we can make a program thats a replacation of the one used to make the cache that is the missing link… if you find that its all a matter of time till we got dragon claws and demon boots but hey whos to say.</p>
