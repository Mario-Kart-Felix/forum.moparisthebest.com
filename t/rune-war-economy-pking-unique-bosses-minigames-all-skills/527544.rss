[size=14pt][COLOR=black]What is RuneWar?[/COLOR][/SIZE]
[list]
	[li]RuneWar is a very unique server and is coded from scratch! RuneWar was formerly known as &#39;Hydrascape&#39; and was one of the greatest private servers on every top list, we had 200-300 players online on average and now we are back to take back that position! RuneWar aims to be what Runescape should have been and strives to provide every player with the best experience possible so they enjoy the gameplay and feel the full force of the server.[/li]
[/list]

[size=14pt]Why should you choose RuneWar over the thousands of other servers out there?[/size]

[list]
	[li]It&#39;s obvious that every server claims to be the best, but we are unique - we care about our players and community, we have a dedicated owner and extremely helpful staff members also, let’s not forget about all the helpful members that are always online to help![/li]
[/list]
We have custom minigames - such as &#39;Battle&#39; / &#39;[COLOR=orange]Legends[/COLOR]&#39; / &#39;[COLOR=orange]ZombiesX[/COLOR]&#39; and more, [COLOR=orange]perfect combat[/COLOR], [COLOR=orange]challenging bosses[/COLOR], and almost [b]all skills are fully coded[/b]! Just because the name has war in it doesn&#39;t mean we leave out the rest like skilling, we offer everything you could want in a server and also have an [u]amazing skilling experience and a great economy as well[/u].

Unlike most servers, RuneWar offers two different play styles to suite everyones preferences. The first mode is: [COLOR=black]Player Killing Mode[/COLOR] (Commonly knows as &quot;pk&#39;ing Mode&quot;) With this mode, you are able to get straight into killing players in the wilderness. This mode gives an extremely high xp gain rate for fast and easy training. The Second mode is: [COLOR=black][COLOR=black]Adventurer Mode[/COLOR][/COLOR] In Adventurer Mode everything is Pretty much normal. This option is for the player which like to enjoy the most out of training skills. If you are one of those people who strive to be number one on the high scores this is the mode for you because unlike the Player Killing Mode, the stats you gain in this mode go towards the HighScores. Along with this, each different mode also has different load out systems. For the adventure mode, there are more Skiller type load outs, just basic getting started gear. With the Pk mode you get a range of more Pk related load outs, such as Magic gear, or Range gear.

1. Achievements - Unlocking Achievements give cash rewards which you can withdraw from your achievement bank. These will never let you get bored!
2. Custom tab - This tab helps you get around the amazing world of Rune War with our own custom teleports and more!
3. Minigames &amp; Bosses - Makes it easy to get to any minigame or boss anytime with the unique tab.
4. Custom PK tab - Shows your Kills and Death Ratio, PK Points, PK supplies show, Reward shops and includes teleports to PK areas. A Pker&#39;s Paradise![/LEFT]
5. Points and Prices - A customed tab to see all your points and prizes from anything that you can gain points through!
The monster teleports gives you the ability to easily teleport between the important monster of RuneWar! These teleports do not require any runes to cast and come in handy when in a rush!

The Skilling teleport gives you the ability to teleport to specific areas in which you can train a specific skill. For example, if you wish to train Fishing you would choose the teleport &quot;Fishing Platform&quot; Which will then proceed to bring you to the required destination in order to gain fishing Levels! Majority of skills are fully coded, and when training skills you will be able to trade points gained by getting xp for valuable items that are required for quick training of other skills!

Points Play a major part in RuneWar and they can be obtained in many different ways! Points are used towards better weapons/armour, cosmetic items and even rare items such as Party-Hats! RuneWar also has a custom feature called the &quot;Gift Centre&quot; Where random gifts are given to the player every 30 minutes of online game-play! These items can range from a useless bucket to an astonishing santa hat! The longer you play the higher chance of getting a good item!

RuneWar has multiple custom mini-games! You wont find these mini-games on any other server guaranteed! 

[img]http://i.imgur.com/dNL79.png[/img]

[COLOR=black][b]Battle (Co-op)[/b][/COLOR]
[img]http://i48.tinypic.com/106k681.jpg[/img]
Battle is a custom mini-game where you will have to fight 11 increasingly harder waves of monsters. Each wave is harder than the next, and is increasingly harder when the mini-game is done with a group of people. On completion of the Mini-game you receive a certain amount of points depending on wether you did it Solo or with another person(s). This points can be used to buy rewards from the Battle Reward shop!

[img]http://i.imgur.com/3vb6j.png[/img]

[COLOR=black]Last Man Standing (FFA) [/COLOR]

Last Man Standing is an ultimate blood bath of skilled warriors going all out to be the &quot;last man standing&quot;. Doing all they can, atleast 5 player enter an arena and fight all on all until 1 person is left. That person is determined as the victor and receives a certain amount of points! These points can be used at the Battle reward store to buy valuable items!

[COLOR=black]Legend (solo)[/COLOR]

[img]http://i.imgur.com/nPTIx.png[/img]

Legend is the ultimate test in combat endurance. Skill is required to fight through multiple groups of different types of monsters until finally reaching the leader! If you have enough skill to defeat the leader a random prize will be rewarded ranging from common to rare!

[img]http://i.imgur.com/qGnB7.gif[/img]

[COLOR=black]Warfare Zombies[/COLOR]

[img]http://i.imgur.com/59IjF.png[/img]

Inspired by the popular COD:Zombies comes Warfare Zombies! As with the call of duty version, wave after wave of multiple zombies spawn each wave where players must defeat in order to advance. Weapons, potions, and food vital for survival are also spread around on the floor which have to be bought with a certain amount of points. These points are gained each time you take away hp from a zombie. 1hp equals to 10 points.
As with the call of duty version there is a mystery chest which gives random weapons varying from a bronze dagger to even god swords! 

[img]http://i.imgur.com/KrgZz.png[/img]

[COLOR=black]Player Killing![/COLOR]

Player killing (Pk&#39;ing) is the ultimate way to pass time by fighting fellow community members. Wether it be to settle an argument over who has the better character, or just to have fun; Player killing is an essential add-on to any advanced server. RuneWar offers 5 battlefields for Pk&#39;ing, so people will never get sick of the same place!

[img]http://i.imgur.com/ZojmO.gif[/img]

RuneWar offers Pk equipment shops so you can get right into defeating opponents if that is your desire, and a Pk rewards shop to spend the points you gain from defeating other opponents at! 

[img]http://i.imgur.com/JwjGm.gif[/img]    [img]http://i.imgur.com/BVdqlNX.gif[/img]

<p>[size=14pt][COLOR=black]What is RuneWar?[/COLOR][/SIZE]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]RuneWar is a very unique server and is coded from scratch! RuneWar was formerly known as ‘Hydrascape’ and was one of the greatest private servers on every top list, we had 200-300 players online on average and now we are back to take back that position! RuneWar aims to be what Runescape should have been and strives to provide every player with the best experience possible so they enjoy the gameplay and feel the full force of the server.[/li]<br>
[/list]</p>
<p>[size=14pt]Why should you choose RuneWar over the thousands of other servers out there?[/size]</p>
<p>[list]<br>
[li]It’s obvious that every server claims to be the best, but we are unique - we care about our players and community, we have a dedicated owner and extremely helpful staff members also, let’s not forget about all the helpful members that are always online to help![/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
We have custom minigames - such as ‘Battle’ / ‘[COLOR=orange]Legends[/COLOR]’ / ‘[COLOR=orange]ZombiesX[/COLOR]’ and more, [COLOR=orange]perfect combat[/COLOR], [COLOR=orange]challenging bosses[/COLOR], and almost <span class="bbcode-b">all skills are fully coded</span>! Just because the name has war in it doesn’t mean we leave out the rest like skilling, we offer everything you could want in a server and also have an <span class="bbcode-u">amazing skilling experience and a great economy as well</span>.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.picasion.com/pic63/292f27600a051f1b90e20e2229b1c772.gif" alt width="" height="">                                                    <img src="http://i.picasion.com/pic63/4fdc7e771dc2abc743058eaed3658786.gif" alt width="400" height="265">[/ul]</p>
<p>Unlike most servers, RuneWar offers two different play styles to suite everyones preferences. The first mode is: [COLOR=black]Player Killing Mode[/COLOR] (Commonly knows as “pk’ing Mode”) With this mode, you are able to get straight into killing players in the wilderness. This mode gives an extremely high xp gain rate for fast and easy training. The Second mode is: [COLOR=black][COLOR=black]Adventurer Mode[/COLOR][/COLOR] In Adventurer Mode everything is Pretty much normal. This option is for the player which like to enjoy the most out of training skills. If you are one of those people who strive to be number one on the high scores this is the mode for you because unlike the Player Killing Mode, the stats you gain in this mode go towards the HighScores. Along with this, each different mode also has different load out systems. For the adventure mode, there are more Skiller type load outs, just basic getting started gear. With the Pk mode you get a range of more Pk related load outs, such as Magic gear, or Range gear.</p>

<p>RuneWar has a unique tab system with-in the game containing everything you may need. The tabs include boss teleports, monster teleports, a way to keep track of any points earned and much much more!</p>

<ol>
<li>Achievements - Unlocking Achievements give cash rewards which you can withdraw from your achievement bank. These will never let you get bored!</li>
<li>Custom tab - This tab helps you get around the amazing world of Rune War with our own custom teleports and more!</li>
<li>Minigames &amp; Bosses - Makes it easy to get to any minigame or boss anytime with the unique tab.</li>
<li>Custom PK tab - Shows your Kills and Death Ratio, PK Points, PK supplies show, Reward shops and includes teleports to PK areas. A Pker’s Paradise![/LEFT]</li>
<li>Points and Prices - A customed tab to see all your points and prizes from anything that you can gain points through!<br>
The monster teleports gives you the ability to easily teleport between the important monster of RuneWar! These teleports do not require any runes to cast and come in handy when in a rush!</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/2xf62.gif" alt width="520" height="140"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/O3b4j.gif" alt width="521" height="143"></p>
<p>The Skilling teleport gives you the ability to teleport to specific areas in which you can train a specific skill. For example, if you wish to train Fishing you would choose the teleport “Fishing Platform” Which will then proceed to bring you to the required destination in order to gain fishing Levels! Majority of skills are fully coded, and when training skills you will be able to trade points gained by getting xp for valuable items that are required for quick training of other skills!</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AoXih.gif" alt width="517" height="140"></p>
<p>Points Play a major part in RuneWar and they can be obtained in many different ways! Points are used towards better weapons/armour, cosmetic items and even rare items such as Party-Hats! RuneWar also has a custom feature called the “Gift Centre” Where random gifts are given to the player every 30 minutes of online game-play! These items can range from a useless bucket to an astonishing santa hat! The longer you play the higher chance of getting a good item!</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/C1JVC.png" alt width="194" height="27"></p>
<p>RuneWar has multiple custom mini-games! You wont find these mini-games on any other server guaranteed!</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dNL79.png" alt width="191" height="233"></p>
<p>[COLOR=black]<span class="bbcode-b">Battle (Co-op)</span>[/COLOR]<br>
<img src="http://i48.tinypic.com/106k681.jpg" alt width="510" height="330"><br>
Battle is a custom mini-game where you will have to fight 11 increasingly harder waves of monsters. Each wave is harder than the next, and is increasingly harder when the mini-game is done with a group of people. On completion of the Mini-game you receive a certain amount of points depending on wether you did it Solo or with another person(s). This points can be used to buy rewards from the Battle Reward shop!</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3vb6j.png" alt width="487" height="307"></p>
<p>[COLOR=black]Last Man Standing (FFA) [/COLOR]</p>
<p>Last Man Standing is an ultimate blood bath of skilled warriors going all out to be the “last man standing”. Doing all they can, atleast 5 player enter an arena and fight all on all until 1 person is left. That person is determined as the victor and receives a certain amount of points! These points can be used at the Battle reward store to buy valuable items!</p>
<p>[COLOR=black]Legend (solo)[/COLOR]</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nPTIx.png" alt width="512" height="310"></p>
<p>Legend is the ultimate test in combat endurance. Skill is required to fight through multiple groups of different types of monsters until finally reaching the leader! If you have enough skill to defeat the leader a random prize will be rewarded ranging from common to rare!</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qGnB7.gif" alt width="360" height="243"></p>
<p>[COLOR=black]Warfare Zombies[/COLOR]</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/59IjF.png" alt width="514" height="331"></p>
<p>Inspired by the popular COD:Zombies comes Warfare Zombies! As with the call of duty version, wave after wave of multiple zombies spawn each wave where players must defeat in order to advance. Weapons, potions, and food vital for survival are also spread around on the floor which have to be bought with a certain amount of points. These points are gained each time you take away hp from a zombie. 1hp equals to 10 points.<br>
As with the call of duty version there is a mystery chest which gives random weapons varying from a bronze dagger to even god swords!</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KrgZz.png" alt width="483" height="300"></p>
<p>[COLOR=black]Player Killing![/COLOR]</p>
<p>Player killing (Pk’ing) is the ultimate way to pass time by fighting fellow community members. Wether it be to settle an argument over who has the better character, or just to have fun; Player killing is an essential add-on to any advanced server. RuneWar offers 5 battlefields for Pk’ing, so people will never get sick of the same place!</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZojmO.gif" alt width="516" height="312"></p>
<p>RuneWar offers Pk equipment shops so you can get right into defeating opponents if that is your desire, and a Pk rewards shop to spend the points you gain from defeating other opponents at!</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JwjGm.gif" alt width="483" height="302">    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/BVdqlNX.gif" alt width="483" height="300"></p>
<p>[COLOR=black]Epic Bosses![/COLOR]</p>
<p>RuneWar offers a large range of bosses to suit everyones needs! Wether you are a master dragon slayer, or the decapitator   of beings unknown, you will never get bored slaying numerous amounts of Bosses!</p>
