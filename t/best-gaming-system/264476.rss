    <description>Which do you prefer?

<p>Well you can compare components of them but really when someone tells me that PS3 is better than Xbox because it has better graphics I really have to ask. “WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!”.  I don’t see how people can care about graphics that much.  For me it’s all about gameplay, well the games that I play.  I don’t give a crap what console it is and what’d be best would be is all the console makers could just stop this lil fued they have going and just release every game on each of there consoles.  They should work together to improve console performance, graphics and gameplay, that way they can make gaming better for their consumers and earn more money as a monopoly/duopoly.</p>

<p>None of the really good games have good graphics, or at least not for long.  Good graphics come and go, but awesome games are awesome forever.  I will use the oldest one in the book for an example.  The original Doom.  If you remember when it came out, it had the most amazing graphics that existed, it looked real to me.  Now it looks like 2d graphics and everything is square and pixelated, yet it is still fun as hell to play.[/quote]<br>
007 Goldeneye, one of the best N64 games ever. I remember playing when I was younger and remember how realistic it was (now it’s not), but I still love it (it was my first FPS).</p>

<p>If you’re going to spout bullshit rumors then at least use believable ones, if blueray was removed then no current PS3 game would work on this “new” PS3, and a lot of existing games would require several dvd discs(and not 2 or 3, I’m talking 5+, see <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/03/02/kojima-mgs4-too-big-for-50-gb-blu-ray-disc/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>).</p>

<p>What about the people that actually had to pay for it, and are still having consoles breaking? If Microsoft are going to get brownie points for “fixing” it, they should have recalled all consoles affected.</p>

There’s your DK statistics, and they’re on the wiki as well.[/quote]</p>
<blockquote>While other companies were moving on to 32-bit systems, Rare and Nintendo proved that the Super NES was still a strong contender in the market. In November 1994, Rare released Donkey Kong Country, a platform game featuring 3D models and textures pre-rendered on SGI workstations. With its detailed graphics and high-quality music, Donkey Kong Country rivaled the aesthetic quality of games that were being released on newer 32-bit CD-based consoles.</blockquote>
It is 16, but it competed with 32.
And I'm not questioning that it was the fastest selling game at the time, I'm questioning if it still is - an article from 1994 doesn't help :P

this man is  sexy! also when your PS3 breaks sony will normally send you another one and take your one away and replace a disc if it gets stuck inside. When mine broke it was out of warranty but i still got it done for free and with an extra 6 months warranty on top of tthat</p>

</aside>
<p>As jme stated, dualshock 3 [now comes default with ps3s] have “rumble packs”.<br>
Why would they take blu ray out of the ps3? That’d be a very stupid move…<br>
For proof that they’re not, this is from an interview with the SCE CEO Kaz Hirai last wednesday:</p>
<blockquote>Will the PS3 go download only?
Let's say we took out the drive so PS3 is network only. What happens when Kojima-san comes out with a new Metal Gear Solid game? Do consumers want to wait for a 50GB download? I think they would rather go the store and pick up a copy. The file sizes for a HD PS3 game are much heavier than a PSP game. Conceptually it may make sense to remove the Blu-Ray drive but in reality it doesn't make sense. Also we never want to be in the position where countries without super fast broadband connections are locked out of the Playstation business because the PS3 has gone download only.</blockquote>
Also, from [url=http://www.joystiq.com/2009/03/12/sony-blu-ray-will-always-be-part-of-ps3/]Joystiq[/url], <blockquote>That would pretty much destroy the PS3's backbone, our games were built on Blu-ray. Quote that: Blu-ray will always be part of PS3.</blockquote>
Afaik, every ps3 game I own is on blu-ray.
My ps3 is fully covered for basically everything - free repair - but that might be from the retailer. However, it's always ran fine. And how does PSN "suck ass"? Free multiplayer gaming? Oh boy, that really sucks, what a shitty deal, xbox live is WAY better...

<p>Well you can compare components of them but really when someone tells me that PS3 is better than Xbox because it has better graphics I really have to ask. “WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!”.  I don’t see how people can care about graphics that much.  For me it’s all about gameplay, well the games that I play.  I don’t give a crap what console it is and what’d be best would be is all the console makers could just stop this lil fued they have going and just release every game on each of there consoles.

<p>Well you can compare components of them but really when someone tells me that PS3 is better than Xbox because it has better graphics I really have to ask. “WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!”.  I don’t see how people can care about graphics that much.  For me it’s all about gameplay, well the games that I play.  I don’t give a crap what console it is and what’d be best would be is all the console makers could just stop this lil fued they have going and just release every game on each of there consoles.  They should work together to improve console performance, graphics and gameplay, that way they can make gaming better for their consumers and earn more money as a monopoly/duopoly.<br>

<p>so you’d play a game with horrible graphics but a good gameplay?[/quote]</p>
<p>That pretty much describes all of the best games ever made…</p>
