In the vast lands, there was a land named Unknown Realm. In it, all the players realmed, continuing a broad journey of success. And in that journey, there was pking, skilling, bosses, quests, and skills which are all trainable. In in those features there were players who made themselves superior to the other by raising it. And through raising it, hard work payed off to be a big grin on the persons face, with economy to balance ones wealth, PKing to gain wealth, and skilling to make ones life something.

My goal is like anyone elses goal in a server such as; stability, a lot of minigames, bosses etc. I want to make a server where you can enjoy yourself and have fun. If their are skillers in my server which there will be, I will make sure to make skilling enjoyable and realistic as possible. Imagine playing with a lot of players, killing bosses, doing minigames, and doing all that with little lag! Also, having the joy of cutting the oak tree, the willow tree, the yew tree, and others, along with fishing for salmon, lobster, swordfish, or even sharks! Ain&#39;t that awesome? You&#39;ll warp your mind from Unknown Realm.

- This is a 317 pi we are in beta Stage there will most likely be bugs here and there
