    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-forum-question/81387</link>
    <description>ok guys, on this forum if a person is warned it says warned under there name?

same for muted and moderated

well i was wondering how you do this because i want to do it for my forum

ALSO.

sometimes if someone posts a reply and next to it, it has a green dot saying what they did wrong i.e. please do not flame/spam

how do you do this??

thanks, jex</description>

              <p>i think you cant do that coz i have never seen a forums using that warned system with the dots. you could try your own idea of a warning system. thats why i have a feeling its only available on these forums. I could be wrongâ€¦</p>
