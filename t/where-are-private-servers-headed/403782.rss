    <title>Where are Private Servers Headed?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-are-private-servers-headed/403782</link>
    <description>   First of all, before starting this discussion. This topic isn&#39;t meant for people to come at me and say I have no idea what I&#39;m talking about. The whole reputation system used on this website is abused, so whatever my reputation is, that does not mean in any case that I have little knowledge of what I&#39;m talking about (Although from most people, I can see why you would assume that). I have around a year and a half of Java practice, and have had interest in private servers for a couple months, few projects. So I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;m not a master by any means at what I like to do, that does not mean I have no idea what I&#39;m talking about.

   Obviously there are some very talented people out there, that are perhaps revolutionizing how private servers are done. Those people have my up-most respect. They know what they are doing. However, it seems like every day, people are asking how to make private servers, asking the simplest questions, and releasing private servers that are just slightly different from the private server 1 thread over. I prefer quality, not quantity.

   I&#39;m not looking for any answer to solving this, no, there is none really. The sudden urge for a Runescape player to be able to control there own &quot;Runescape&quot; and have other people play on it is very enticing for them, that&#39;s agreeable. This may last a very short period because either they give up, or they release something that is equal to the poop of an elephant with down syndrome (Good analogy huh? I liked it). It almost makes no sense at why we even help them.

   There are so many private servers out there today, that new ones that come out that actually are very well done, and are original, have no room to gain popularity. Everyone needs help every now and then, that&#39;s true. I just wish there was some system, that could limit the amount of people that just spam the [b]Server Help[/b] with questions that are answered every hour. They can&#39;t seem to use the search bar or anything like that.

   Obviously after writing this, you may think &quot;Who the hell is this kid, to think that he is above everyone else?&quot;. I&#39;m not, many of you are 10x more talented then me. I have no interest in starting a project of mine until I&#39;ve completed learning Java (whatever that means), and will have no need to ask many questions.

   Discuss, I&#39;m curious to hear what you guys think.</description>

              <p>I like the idea of being able to chose how much rep you give out per person (obviously only lower than the amount you could normally give) But let’s face it, reputation is messed up here and it’s going to stay that way until we get a more mature or knowledgeable user-base. Even on MITB they don’t deny it’s pretty bad, you get rep for making funny comments there too.</p>
<p>EDIT - Just saw this wasn’t what the topic was about, let’s get back to where private servers are headed.</p>

Rep means reputation, not how much you know about something. Someone can be very reputable, yet be very ignorant in programming. Yet, you shouldn’t receive 13 reputation points for posting something funny. I think what vain posted would fix most of our rep issues on this side of the forum.[/quote]<br>
yes i agree with this post.  you won’t (or shouldn’t) ever go to a funny person with no experience with whatever it is that you do or programming for help.</p>

<p>I say we make reputation not increment so much as to by how much rep you have. For example, when I give someone rep, it gives them 13 rep. This really makes me not want to deal out rep because some users don’t deserve 13 whole reputation points. I may of liked that they released something and it was very useful, but I don’t think 13 reputation points is what they deserve. Maybe we need to make it so rep++ only adds one reputation point <span class="bbcode-b">on this side of the forums</span> or that you can determine how many reputation points you are about to deal out. Would be really nice.</p>

<p>And even if there is a timer, people will post a bunch of shit in one whole topic, making it even worse.<br>

<p>Good Ideas, however it won’t work with being logged in for at least 30min. I’ve been logged on for 2 hours now, and I haven’t even been on the website really.[/quote]Yeah I guess not. Maybe it’s time for Rep to actually mean something.

</aside>
<p>This is true, people need to ask for help in order to learn a lot of the time. I suppose the big problems are grammar, and just asking idiotic questions that can be found by using the search bar for 10 seconds. There’s nothing we can do to honestly help this. Unfortunately.</p>

I appreciate the fact that, unlike most people on this site, you use any sort of form of proper grammar. Respect.</p>
<p>But, you obviously haven’t been HERE very long. Nothing’s going to change when a site like this is populated, as a majority, by 9-12 year old kids. I promise, we’ve had SO many threads just like this one talking about how unoriginal servers have been. It’s ridiculous in my opinion, but it’s not going to change so long as things are ran how they are now.</p>
<p>I feel it COULD get better if, perhaps, we had a thread made just for posting frameworks of servers. The skilled people could take those and turn them into something great. How it is now, where people just add their own little bits and repost a WL or PI servers, nothing’s going to get better. It’ll only get worse, because those bits they’re adding suck. Every few years a new framework is created that becomes popular, but the good parts of it are lost within a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>Basically, I feel as if the BIG things of the site need to change for any progress to be made. The method of management of the servers needs to be reworked into a more functional manner to where the good servers pop out over the half-assed ones.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s just a thought, haven’t thought of the pros/cons of it yet. What if there was some way you could prove yourself “worthy” in some sense of being able to access a different part of the forums (Obviously this would get spammed with requests everyday), but in these new, private forums, you could have…what’s the word? Legit shit. Heh[/quote]<br>
I think we have something like that. It’s called MoparScape Vet, if I am not mistaken. The actual title was taken away, but you still get access to a “secret” board.</p>

<p>Yeah, it seems it would only help out the Server Help section and just spam the rest of the board. <span class="bbcode-b">However, the fact if people just used appropriate grammar when asking questions would make helping a little more enticing lol.</span></p>

</aside>
<p>This needs to be stressed, although it will never happen. I hate having to open up my l33t to English dictionary to understand what the hell they are saying. If we created a timer per threads posted in the Server help section, all they would do is modify their original thread with their next question. I just wish the kids showed signs of intelligence. Then I would be more willing to try and help them…</p>

              <p>I appreciate the fact that, unlike most people on this site, you use any sort of form of proper grammar. Respect.</p>
<p>But, you obviously haven’t been HERE very long. Nothing’s going to change when a site like this is populated, as a majority, by 9-12 year old kids. I promise, we’ve had SO many threads just like this one talking about how unoriginal servers have been. It’s ridiculous in my opinion, but it’s not going to change so long as things are ran how they are now.</p>
<p>I feel it COULD get better if, perhaps, we had a thread made just for posting frameworks of servers. The skilled people could take those and turn them into something great. How it is now, where people just add their own little bits and repost a WL or PI servers, nothing’s going to get better. It’ll only get worse, because those bits they’re adding suck. Every few years a new framework is created that becomes popular, but the good parts of it are lost within a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>Basically, I feel as if the BIG things of the site need to change for any progress to be made. The method of management of the servers needs to be reworked into a more functional manner to where the good servers pop out over the half-assed ones.</p>
