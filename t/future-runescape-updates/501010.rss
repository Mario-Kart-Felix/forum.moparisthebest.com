    <description>[b]Construction:[/b]
In a development blog, Mod Mark commented that Jagex was planning to release many more rooms and the Menagerie was only the start. What the new rooms could be is unknown.

[b]More Elemental Workshop quests[/b]
There will be more Elemental Workshops quests.
[quote=&quot;&quot;Mod Mark&quot;&quot;]3 or 5 depending on how the last parts turn out.[/quote]

[b]Mourning&#39;s End Part III[/b]
It was said that this quest was going to be released this year but Mod Mark stated that the quest will be so big that it will take place after HTML5 is implemented. Release date possibly in 2014.

[b]Black Knight&#39;s Fortress &amp; Demon Slayer rework[/b]
In the fourth live Q&amp;A session, there was a hint about the Black Knight&#39;s Fortress quest being redone.

[b]200th Quest[/b]
Mod Mark confirmed that the 200th quest will end a story line and it could possibly trim the Quest cape.

[b]Fossil Island[/b]
This island was revealed during the fifth live Q&amp;A session and it will have to do with the Varrock Museum, where an unmentioned Dragonkin lives. Because of a large graphical budget this will take, this has been put on hold.

[b]Kandarin (Ardougne) &amp; Falador rework[/b]
Just as a lot of other places getting reworked to look a shit ton better, these two cities will as well.

[b]Mobile RuneScape[/b]
Jagex wants to bring RuneScape to tablets and mobile devices so players can interact with the game and community on the go.

[b]Spanish and Dutch RuneScape[/b]
I believe this one is pretty self-explanatory.

[b]Item Recovery[/b]
Jagex is looking into a way to give players their items that they have lost to being hacked and or lured. Nothing else has been said about this though.

[b]Player Moderators[/b]
In the fourth live Q&amp;A session, it was also mentioned that they would expand the player moderator system to include ambassadors and mentors, in an effort to flesh out the system.

[b]HTML5[/b]
If you don&#39;t know what HTML5 means in gaming, it&#39;s basically ridiculous graphics for just a browser game like RuneScape. It will most likely be released late this year. 
Beta:
The Monster Bestiary is the beta for HTML5 if any of you guys have played with it. Notice the texture/particle, monster detail, and shadow differences. To date, the RuneScape Bestiary only works in Google Chrome, using WebGL, and requires 3D video card drivers. Addressing concerns that some computers would no longer be able to run RuneScape once HTML5 was released. Although, the original RuneScape client will still be up and able to download.

[b]RuneScape &quot;3&quot;[/b]
Many of you complain about Solomon&#39;s Store and the Squeal of Fortune, but these two things help make money for this project Jagex is working on. RuneScape 3 will include huge updates like: Advanced graphics, audio, lighting and textures, customisable interface and would run on HTML5.

[b]Two new skills[/b]
Mod Mark confirmed it would not be sailing, whilst listing several suggestions that had come up, including unarmed combat, necromancy and others. In the fourth live Q&amp;A session Mod Mark confirmed that two new skills would be released. One would be a gathering skill like mining and woodcutting and one would be a production skill such as crafting. What form these skills will take is yet to be announced. In a November 2012 Behind the Scenes the new skills were described as &quot;designed to suit the old-school, yet complement the entire game&quot; since it was modelled &quot;on some of our oldest and dearest content.&quot;

If you guys hear or see more about these updates or different updates, just make a post.</description>

I know there is a downloadable client, but only the downloadable client instead of the web client. They might be able to achieve better graphics then the one’s they’re trying to pull off at the moment.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I see what you mean by that but, not everyone can download things because of administrative rights and what not.[/quote]</p>
<p>The download client doesn’t need admin rights (See Andrews picture)</p>

Considering it would be a new system, they would almost definitely only have records of trades and such after it would be implemented, assuming they use the trade records as the primary source of the logs.</p>

I meant that by you don’t need JDK or JRE. At least from what my brother says, he doesn’t have either installed. He could be wrong because he isn’t computer friendly though.</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">Construction:</span><br>
In a development blog, Mod Mark commented that Jagex was planning to release many more rooms and the Menagerie was only the start. What the new rooms could be is unknown.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">More Elemental Workshop quests</span><br>
There will be more Elemental Workshops quests.</p>
<aside class="quote">

 "Mod Mark":</div>
<blockquote>
<p>3 or 5 depending on how the last parts turn out.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Mourning’s End Part III</span><br>
It was said that this quest was going to be released this year but Mod Mark stated that the quest will be so big that it will take place after HTML5 is implemented. Release date possibly in 2014.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Black Knight’s Fortress &amp; Demon Slayer rework</span><br>
In the fourth live Q&amp;A session, there was a hint about the Black Knight’s Fortress quest being redone.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">200th Quest</span><br>
Mod Mark confirmed that the 200th quest will end a story line and it could possibly trim the Quest cape.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Fossil Island</span><br>
This island was revealed during the fifth live Q&amp;A session and it will have to do with the Varrock Museum, where an unmentioned Dragonkin lives. Because of a large graphical budget this will take, this has been put on hold.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Kandarin (Ardougne) &amp; Falador rework</span><br>
Just as a lot of other places getting reworked to look a shit ton better, these two cities will as well.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Mobile RuneScape</span><br>
Jagex wants to bring RuneScape to tablets and mobile devices so players can interact with the game and community on the go.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Spanish and Dutch RuneScape</span><br>
I believe this one is pretty self-explanatory.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Item Recovery</span><br>
Jagex is looking into a way to give players their items that they have lost to being hacked and or lured. Nothing else has been said about this though.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Player Moderators</span><br>
In the fourth live Q&amp;A session, it was also mentioned that they would expand the player moderator system to include ambassadors and mentors, in an effort to flesh out the system.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">HTML5</span><br>
If you don’t know what HTML5 means in gaming, it’s basically ridiculous graphics for just a browser game like RuneScape. It will most likely be released late this year.<br>
Beta:<br>
The Monster Bestiary is the beta for HTML5 if any of you guys have played with it. Notice the texture/particle, monster detail, and shadow differences. To date, the RuneScape Bestiary only works in Google Chrome, using WebGL, and requires 3D video card drivers. Addressing concerns that some computers would no longer be able to run RuneScape once HTML5 was released. Although, the original RuneScape client will still be up and able to download.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">RuneScape “3”</span><br>
Many of you complain about Solomon’s Store and the Squeal of Fortune, but these two things help make money for this project Jagex is working on. RuneScape 3 will include huge updates like: Advanced graphics, audio, lighting and textures, customisable interface and would run on HTML5.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Two new skills</span><br>
Mod Mark confirmed it would not be sailing, whilst listing several suggestions that had come up, including unarmed combat, necromancy and others. In the fourth live Q&amp;A session Mod Mark confirmed that two new skills would be released. One would be a gathering skill like mining and woodcutting and one would be a production skill such as crafting. What form these skills will take is yet to be announced. In a November 2012 Behind the Scenes the new skills were described as “designed to suit the old-school, yet complement the entire game” since it was modelled “on some of our oldest and dearest content.”</p>
<p>If you guys hear or see more about these updates or different updates, just make a post.</p>
