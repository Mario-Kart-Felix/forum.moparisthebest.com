<p>Regrammarization for the people who would say “what?” or “explain better”:</p>
<p>Okay, here’s the problem. I am making my own server. I downloaded Project Fubergen as my client to use, and I’m using Testscape for my source.<br>
I’m also using no-ip. (You shouldn’t have to unless you port forwarded.)<br>
There’s two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don’t really know how to use my source with the client, considering it looks the same, and people just open up both or something; I’m not really sure.</li>
<li>When I try to ping my no-ip, it says my server has a ping of 3miliseconds. When I try to log in I get an error that says: “Unexpected Server Response, Please Try using a Different World.”</li>
</ol>
<p>I am open to any comments on these two problems. Thank you for your time.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your client is connecting to IP: 127.0.0.1. Check this in GUI.java, or EGUI.java, in your client folder. Then try and run your server, then run your client.<br>
(You DON’T need No-ip for your server if you’re connecting to 127.0.0.1 - Localhost. You only need No-ip if you port forwarded and want people on your server.)</li>
<li>No-ip part, you don’t need. Fix <span class="hashtag">#1</span> and <span class="hashtag">#2</span> should be automatically fixed.</li>
</ol>
