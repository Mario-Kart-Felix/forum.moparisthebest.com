1. ON testscae there is a stat glitch. like for example... lets say im 74 str then i level to 75. it will say 74/75 untill i log out.. while on other servs it wud be 75/75. How do i make so i dont have to log out when i level up?

2. Making a command looks lik its so easy yet i dont get it. ppl tell me the format but i dont know were to place it. If someone could maby tell me where and how to put a command in then it would help a lot.

3. how and were do i add global objects. (dont say fedexers guide because i dont understand it).[/center][br][size=1]Posted on: April 09, 2007, 11:00:50 AM[/size][hr]no one wants to help??</description>
