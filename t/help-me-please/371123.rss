    <title>Help me please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-please/371123</link>
    <description>Okay I&#39;m running a Mac OS X Version 10.5.8 and I&#39;m having some issues. I can&#39;t find a server that is compatible with my mac.

Can someone give me a client/Webclient that will work for me? I&#39;m not very good with computer stuff i just like to play. If someone could help me I&#39;d much appreciate it.

Even if someone could give me a tutorial on how to make one work, that would be excellent.

Cheers.</description>
