    <title>Help Me Please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-please/11349</link>
    <description>Okay, here&#39;s the problem. I was browsing the internet like I usually do downloading games and music etc.. then I came here and I got a firefox error and it closed. I tried going to all sorts of sites and got the same error, finally I re-installed my internet explorer( :( ) and re-downloaded firefox and re-installed it. I then tried too goto this site again and the computer restarted. I then logged back on and tried to download all the updated drivers for my computer and when I tried to run them I got the same error everytime. File is corrupted :(. So I decided that it might be a virus or spyware or whatever and I reinstalled windows and formated the hard drive. I then got back online and tried to download all sorts of things that I used to have starting with firefox then moving on to bitcomet and all my drivers. However the only download that worked was firefox :(. I&#39;m starting to think that it might be my hard drive. If anyone has any ideas I would apreciate any help and/or advice. Thank you.[br][size=1]Posted at: August 27, 2006, 08:09:49 PM[/size][hr]Also I have a second 160 gig hard drive that I can reformat and install windows on but I&#39;ve planning on using it for a web server :( Please Help[br][size=1]Posted at: August 27, 2006, 08:21:52 PM[/size][hr]Please anyone, I just want some input</description>

              <p>if its a successful reformat and you can only download firefox and nothing else, it may be due to some ip blocking going on. if its a hard drive error you wont be able to dl anything.</p>

              <p>I don’t think so, unless theres a virus that can survive a hard drive being reformated?</p>
