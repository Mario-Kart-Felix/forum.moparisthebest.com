    <description>ok, so i have looked at how to make a server. i downloaded a source that i liked (jefkescape server) and i have an ip. but when i try to get on it using silabsoft i get &quot;error connecting to server&quot;. so i go back to the &quot;how to make a server&quot; and i try Port Forwarding, but that just gets me confused. If anyone can help me with my server co-ownership will be granted</description>
