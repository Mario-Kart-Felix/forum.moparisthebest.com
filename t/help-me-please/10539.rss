    <title>Help me Please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-please/10539</link>
    <description>I have been away for the past 2 days now, when I came back-my account was changed a bit.
My rep went from +8 to +2 and my signature went from &quot;It was a link to how to get free PSPs&quot; to &quot;The one I have now&quot;. Im betting some other things have changed but I havnt noticed, I dont check my profile stuff often. In the news box (on the home page) is says something about accounts being deleted. Can anyone fill me in on whats happened in the past 2 days? Somone hacked the site? Please and Thank you.
