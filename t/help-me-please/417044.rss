    <description>Alright... I&#39;m trying to get a server up and running for me and others to be able to play, BUT I have no idea what I&#39;m doing and was wondering if someone wouldn&#39;t mind helping me figure this out, NOT doing it all for me but explaining what to do and where to find it.

Please add me on Skype if you have one: Coryrsps
If you don&#39;t just reply or send me a PM please, thanks a lot!!</description>
