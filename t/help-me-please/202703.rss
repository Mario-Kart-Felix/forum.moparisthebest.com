    <title>Help me please =[</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-please/202703</link>
    <description>Hi guys, I&#39;m new to making Runescape private servers, so I&#39;m hoping that some of you can help me out. I have downloaded the Project Czar source and looking at some coding guides into how to edit it. One guide shows me how to change where the starting position is. It looked really simple and I done everything I was supposed to, but when I compiled and run the server, it didnt change. I think it may be becuase A) The folder I was told to edit was player.java, but the only thing with player in the title is player (notepad) and player.class. Or B) I am doing something wrong.

Here is a link to the Tut http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,245699.0.html.

Hope you can help =]</description>
