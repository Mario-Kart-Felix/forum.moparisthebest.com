    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-please/255843</link>
    <description>Well, you see I need help with getting other people to connect to my server. I have put in my server name in the EGUI.Java and I Port forwarded, Also No-Ip is up and running my server, but for some reason, I or any other person can log on with my REAL Ip, I can log on without any IP or 127.0.0.1 and on the client, but when I try it on silabs, or mopar it only works to log onto my client with a blank IP OR 127.0.0.1

Anyone know what to do? if so pleaseeeeeeee help! :(
