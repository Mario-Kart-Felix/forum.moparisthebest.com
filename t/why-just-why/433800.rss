    <title>Why? Just Why?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-just-why/433800</link>
    <description>[i]*side comment* Here I go with another essay![/i]

I have been wondering. I always see people in Server Help with things such as adding an item. I can understand, they are new. However, people in this forums (this time, this sometimes includes ME) hog into easy answers and don&#39;t answer harder or intermediate ones. Why? If a good coder, for example jaruanna, is posting a topic for help, people are too busy helping the easy ones (this applies to those who actually know the answer to the question but ignore it). I have noticed, when jaruanna for example posts [i]How to assign a variable a value from another method?[/i], then I only see 1 - 3 replies, mostly the replies aren&#39;t helpful. I think people should start [b]learning from there codes they get[/b], and start observing other codes for your answer. I told my friend that you should observe to get accomplishments. Why don&#39;t you? This means, if you need help with say a command like [i]How to add ::staffzone command?[/i]. Did you observe the code the lovely developers gave you? Why didn&#39;t you look at the commands before you ask. If you don&#39;t know how to observe code, there is also a billion tutorials on adding command. Why don&#39;t you observe? Rather you directly ask the question, and with that personality, I KNOW, FOR SURE, when a person gives you the code, you will copy and paste, no studying the code, no nothing. Can you see people such as Davidi2, who gradually improved. You can see is first post to his last post in Server Help, you can see 100% improvement. You can say same thing for imsuperman05. When he started, he was a total idiot from how he spoke (no offense to him), but do you see him now (besides his flaming)? He has improved, writes tutorials, and helps people (sometimes, no offense). Why? Because he studied the code, and studied hard. I advice all newcomers, please, improve on your coding skills from each step you learn, you will emerge victorious in server coding. This is what other people are saying:

[quote=&quot;Rodgerwilco&quot;]The problem is people don&#39;t learn java, they learn how to c.sendMessage(&quot;Hey I sent this message&quot;); without learning wtf java is.

Like I stated before... create a java docs that utilizes private server functionality and have a link to it next to the rs wiki^up top. Then create a server help section and a private server help section (for people who have lets say 50+ rep) for more serious matters.[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Kidpaparoach&quot;]This community is a bizzarre community, thats why. I think that there are many young people in this community(like myself) who don&#39;t contribute and not enough who do contribute and that is what the site is lacking and if the community wont improve maybe the advertising should improve. I prefer this site to Rune-srv(I only use r-serv for rsps purposes though) but if I actually want to know how to do something I&#39;ll generally go to r-serv to learn something if not post on both cause this community isn&#39;t very helpful in comparison.[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Arham 4&quot;]I push myself by bargaining a billion projects on me just to get use to programming. People who make framework from scratch are like the people I wis to be like. To be a higher level.[/quote]

[quote=&quot;the elve age&quot;]I understand that people will thrive to be better, and I have nothing against that, but when people claim to know full blown java when &quot;programming&quot; some s***ty base someone MADE for them, it just drives me crazy.[/quote]

Sincerely,
Arham

P.S: If anyone received any offense, I am sorry, but this is the truth.</description>

Just not the tag part :P.</p>
<p>In that post, <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,537067.msg3926820.html#msg3926820" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> is just super funny (no offence to the guy PureQuintinScape)! Mk, he put comment code (/* */) and then the below post…</p>
<p>[quote=“PureQuintinScape, post:20, topic:434346”]Thanks david, but one more problem, the command doesn’t work in-game after i added it, etc</p>
<p>Need someone to teamview me, will rep++!!![/quote]</p>
<p>I thought David-mod_of_lordscape knew that and would reply, but then, he says:</p>
<p>[quote=“David-mod_of_lordscape, post:21, topic:434346”]Change ,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">c.puremaster = 1;</code></pre>
<p>To</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">c.puremaster = 0;</code></pre>
<p>And I’m like, you didn’t know about comments where you’re telling him this?</p>
<p>Again,</p>
