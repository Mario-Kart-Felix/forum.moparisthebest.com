    <title>Question For Everyone</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-for-everyone/22607</link>
    <description>Say i have a question for everyone here...

Q1) why do you usually come to the help section?

- Is it because you just wanna have fun leaving replys like (read blah blah blah)
- or to just call people names?

*until now? i have seen lots of abuse on this forum? god i wonder how many people gets banned a day.. if none.. so people liked the client moparscape and they come to the forum for help and what do they get from that*

(go to hell and dont post here?) is what really this forum is about? not just players.. even mods do that.. wtf?

you know it wouldnt kill you to just give someone who is asking for help a link.. trust me it takes less time than typing

GO search for it? search for what? at least be a little bit specific. or dont even bother posting in the first place..

just tell people who need help a link to a post or give them a clue about what they want help with.. it really helps thank just calling them names and stuff.. BE NICE! :mad:[br][size=1]Posted at: November 05, 2006, 10:23:03 PM[/size][hr]or is it just because people wanna get their rep up? lol people these days are odd..</description>
