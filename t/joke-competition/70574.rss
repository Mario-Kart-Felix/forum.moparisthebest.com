There are three men in heaven telling the story to god about how they died…<br>
The first guy said: "I was coming home from the store when i saw a thief on my balcony hanging off  of it. I ran to him and slamed my fists on his hands. He didnt budge. So i took a hammer and slammed it on his fingers. He finnaly let go and landed in a bush. Then i grabbed my refrigerator and dropped it on him. The refrigerator hit the bush and exploded. I felt so sad that he died that I got a heartattack and died.</p>
<p>The second guy said: "I was dangling off a guys balcony when this mad man came at me and slammed my fingers with his fists. But I wouldnt let go. He then took a hammer and banged it on my hand so I let go. I fell in a bush and the guy dropped a refrigerator on me and it blew up and i died.</p>

              <p>There was a nerd in a ship, but suddenly it shipwrecks. Nerd is the only one who survived it because he managed to swam to nearby island.<br>
After 1 year the nerd was still at the island, but one day he saw someone coming to beach with somekind of small boat. Nerd jumped up and started to wave his hands and calling help, and the boat came to shore.<br>
Soon the nerd noticed how the boat was made from some tree trunks, very poorly done. Woman who came with boat asked:"Hi, were you in the shipwreck about 1 year ago?<br>
He answered:“Yea… I thought I was the only survivor.”<br>
Woman soon noticed how poorly the nerd was living at the island, he didn’t even have any shelter so she asked him to come with her, to her place.</p>
<p>Soon they row to woman’s beach and nerd noticed how the woman had even made a little path with stones. Nerd said:“I have been sleeping without any shelter for about year and you have build even a little path with rock???!”<br>
Woman answered:“Well… 1 year is a long time you know.”</p>
<p>Woman had build a very large and fancy treehouse, nerd was amazed and couldn’t say a thing. Soon they went inside it.<br>
Woman said:“I noticed how long your beard is, want to shave it?”<br>
“But how?” asked nerd.<br>
“I have made a little shaver, it’s in the bathroom.”<br>
She even had bathroom and everything, even shower!<br>
Soon nerd shaved his beard and came out of bathroom. Woman asked if he would like to have some drink, but nerd got angry and yelled:“No more coconut milk! I have had enough of it!”<br>
Woman answered:“Woah… Hold on, I got something better here. I have learned how to make distrill alcohol drink from it. Wanna have some?”</p>
<p>When they were drinking the coconut booze, woman started to get closer and closer to nerd, and said she will go to shower.</p>
<p>Nerd was still amazed, he had been sleeping under palms for about year but this woman has made huge house, bathroom, shower and even booze!</p>
<p>Woman came out of shower, almost half naked and said:“Look I even made a little bed in here…” nerd just answered “Cool”.<br>
Woman continued:“You know… I think we both miss one thing from normal life, that men and women usually do…”<br>
Nerd jumped up and was really excited and asked with loud voice:“WHAT?? CAN I READ MY EMAIL???”</p>
