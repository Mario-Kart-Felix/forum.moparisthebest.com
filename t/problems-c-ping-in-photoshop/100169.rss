    <title>Problems C&amp;Ping in Photoshop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-c-ping-in-photoshop/100169</link>
    <description>Okay, so, I&#39;m not having any trouble at all when it comes to Prt Scrn but whenever I just try copying a picture and paste it into Photoshop it doesn&#39;t work, so I&#39;m forced to keep Prt Scrning and lassoing and such. Is there something I&#39;m missing that you have to do to copy and paste manually copied into Photoshop? All help appreciated, thanks!</description>

<p>Just right click &gt; copy image then open up Photoshop and hit Ctrl + V or edit &gt; paste.</p>
