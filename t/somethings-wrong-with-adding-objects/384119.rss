    <title>Somethings wrong with adding objects</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/somethings-wrong-with-adding-objects/384119</link>
    <description>[size=18pt]Well what i&#39;m trying to do is add an object, in this case its a portal. However every tutorial is telling me to go to my client.java and find post it in there somewhere where it belongs. I looked for the location it&#39;s supposed to be at and i found nothing.

Am i supposed to put this in another file in either client side or source side?

I have a 508 loading 525 cache. With Roldpvp&#39;s base? I believe so. I think. lol[/size]</description>
