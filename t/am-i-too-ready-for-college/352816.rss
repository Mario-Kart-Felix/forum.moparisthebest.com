    <title>Am I too ready for college?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/am-i-too-ready-for-college/352816</link>
    <description>I have already packed all of my boxes and shit for college, the only stuff left is my computer, clothes, and stuff to get me through my last year of high school. I already know which college I am going to, where I am going to live, and a bunch of other shit that most other people don&#39;t know until the last minute. I tried to convince my parents to let me move to where I am going to be going to college (my hometown) and go to a private high school (all of my old friends are there, and alot of hot girls), but that failed epicly. Mind you I am starting my senior year in 20 days....am I too ready?</description>

That is incredible. How much do you pay in rent? I’ve seen the on-campus accommodation at my university, and it is absolutely nothing by comparison to your place. Seriously, what the fuck – a fireplace?![/quote]</p>
<p>It’s my grandparent’s basement (that room you see, a kitchen behind it, bedroom to the right were the windows are, and exercise room off of that. I just have to mow the lawn, vacuum, and do any other shit they ask and I can stay, I have to move out after college though buts thats 5 years from now so…I’m kinda in fear of posting other pictures and being accused of being rich. I’ve really never had anything like this in my life and my old room was a twin bed that was kinda small so im pretty excited. I might post some more in a bit.</p>

<p>Well its probably going to be the same for me haha. The whole basement is mine and it was finished off about 2 years ago with game room, exercise room, living room, kitchen, and a couple of bedrooms so I don’t know how they will be able to keep track of me easily when they are on the upper level the whole time.</p>

<p>Hell yes, I mean i’m not there atm but I visit over the summer and christmas, I will be there in 5 days as long as they can get my transferred over in time and can get me a schedule to meet the requirements for the senior year. But once i’m there I will be free as fuck, I won’t know what to do with myself. I will have to meet some of my old friends from along time ago then from there hmmmm…<br>
[/quote]GET SOME WOMEN!</p>

</aside>
<p>I already have some ladies friends there, but I wouldn’t want to post pics for the sake that they somehow how could make the connection to here, which would be disastrous as nobody knows that I browse this site (except you guys). Besides the fact that it is probably an invasion of privacy to post pics from private Facebook profiles. But yes I do hope to get some women, as the women in the city I am currently living in are all unfuckably ugly to the point that, if your not careful, your dick may shrink from overexposure.<br>
[/quote]Been there done that.  Moved from Ottawa to this little city outside of Toronto where all the girls were soooo damned ugly.  It sucked because I dumped my (in my opinion) gorgeous girlfriend when I had to move.  The next year I moved back to Ottawa and hooked up with my ex’s 18 year old sister.  Ottawa is a gold-mine of babes.</p>

</aside>
<p>Hell yes, big citys are awesome. Its like all the hot girls flock there, plenty to pick from.<br>
[/quote]Go to a club.[/quote]<br>
Probably going to be going to alot of places. I already talked to some girls so we are going to hang the first day I get there, also just talked to my new hs counselor and everything is almost finalized.</p>

<p>Well its probably going to be the same for me haha.

<p>Hell yes, I mean i’m not there atm but I visit over the summer and christmas, I will be there in 5 days as long as they can get my transferred over in time and can get me a schedule to meet the requirements for the senior year. But once i’m there I will be free as fuck, I won’t know what to do with myself. I will have to meet some of my old friends from along time ago then from there hmmmm…<br>

</aside>
<p>I already have some ladies friends there, but I wouldn’t want to post pics for the sake that they somehow how could make the connection to here, which would be disastrous as nobody knows that I browse this site (except you guys). Besides the fact that it is probably an invasion of privacy to post pics from private Facebook profiles. But yes I do hope to get some women, as the women in the city I am currently living in are all unfuckably ugly to the point that, if your not careful, your dick may shrink from overexposure.[/quote]Been there done that.  Moved from Ottawa to this little city outside of Toronto where all the girls were soooo damned ugly.  It sucked because I dumped my (in my opinion) gorgeous girlfriend when I had to move.  The next year I moved back to Ottawa and hooked up with my ex’s 18 year old sister.  Ottawa is a gold-mine of babes.</p>
