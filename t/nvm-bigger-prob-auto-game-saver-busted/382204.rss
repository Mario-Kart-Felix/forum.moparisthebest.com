    <description>[s]OK I was coding a command and I had accidentaly deleted my npcreset command :P..I know one of you has it if you could post it here?[PI]
sorry for the nubby question lol..[/s]
OK well i just realized that my auto game saver is busted, I gained 2 attacks lvls and about an hour later I &#39;x&#39;d out the cmd box and i lost those 2 lvls.
the players game does save when they loggout, but how can I make it where it saves up to every3mins when they&#39;re logged in?</description>
