    <description>Wondering if someone could help me in finding the antiderivative of (sin(z*arctan(x)))/((1 + x^2)^(z/2)*(e^(pi * x) + 1))
Where z stands for some constant (to be honest it&#39;s a complex constant, but I could care less about complex right now)

It&#39;s the integral listed here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function#Integral

So far I have had the idea of using u substitution to do arctan(x) = u so you have sin(zu) up top and sin(u) = x/sqrt(1+x^2)
I forget my trig identities because I feel like there is something you can do from some constant in front of x radians to express all solutions since it is circular...
Also in the bottom since x = tan(u) you get 1 + tan^2(u) which I believe is an trig identity but I forget for what.

Just wondering if someone could try and help out or maybe give me some ideas. I am thinking of maybe creating a &quot;new&quot; method of integration where like intregration by parts is reverse product rule I could use a reverse quotient rule and then make the bottom function into a product. I haven&#39;t been formally taught integral calculus so I&#39;m sure I&#39;m probably doing something wrong or not knowing something to make this problem easier. Thanks.</description>

              <p>As far as I know, there isn’t any easy or even remotely obvious way to solve the integral. It’s not as simple as finding the antiderivative of the Gamma function or even the Beta function. However, on a related note, the Riemann zeta function can be expressed partially in terms of the Gamma function, which is not surprising, but interesting.</p>

<p>Already tried. It said calulation ended and I need to become a member for it to solve it. Then I found a widget and it said that it cannot be expressed in elementary operations. I still want to find the antiderivative of it even if it cannot be expressed in elementary operations, I just need to know how. Like what inverse function do I need.</p>
