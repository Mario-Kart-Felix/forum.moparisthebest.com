    <title>Private Server Hosting on server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/private-server-hosting-on-server/279235</link>
    <description>Okay basically my question is how do I run a Private server off my server? I don&#39;t want to have to have my computer on 24/7. As private servers need .cmd to start the server how would I go about doing this?

I have a godaddy hosting server not dedicated, but the server does have a ip address (duhh.. ) Would I still need to use no-ip?

The end result will be php &amp; mysql working together with in-game java.

Thanks ahead of time to those who end up solving my problem.

Please note that I have spent the last few hours reading on private servers and what not so my understanding of the whole concept isn&#39;t so great. If you could just point me in the right direction that would help me out very much! Thanks</description>

              <p>Thanks but could someone walk me through a little more?</p>
<p>I currently have UTorrent open, and I opened up preferences; what do I do in there now?<br>
Do I need to still install the JDK update to my computer if I am running it off my server and not my computer?</p>
<p>All my Private servers source files are uploaded to my server.<br>
I have no-ip also, registered and everything is set up.<br>
To get Server running what exactly do I do?</p>
<p>Thank you guys for all your time spent helping me!</p>
