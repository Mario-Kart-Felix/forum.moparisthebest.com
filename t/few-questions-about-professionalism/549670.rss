    <title>Few Questions About Professionalism</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-questions-about-professionalism/549670</link>
    <description>Alright, so this is for those of you who are professional developers/designers/freelancers, or whatever you call yourself. Basically I&#39;m turning 18 here soon, and I&#39;m wanting to do some freelance work to make some extra money during college, or whatever I end up doing after high school. And to also begin getting connected with people in the business, and potential employers and such. From what I&#39;ve gathered, GitHub and LinkedIn are going to be two of my best friends for getting myself out there, and then oDesk for freelancing, unless there&#39;s something better. One question is: I want to start building a portfolio using GitHub, what are some ideas for programs that I could put on GitHub to show off my work? Any language works, doesn&#39;t matter. My main goal is to get into game development, professionally or freelancing or whatever, but I&#39;ll settle for general software. Don&#39;t know if that matters as far as portfolio&#39;s and stuff. Getting connections, I was on LinkedIn a while back, but I never used it so I deleted the account until later on when I was ready to actually put effort into it.. I&#39;ll stop rambling there, I&#39;ll get some feedback then ask more questions, thanks for anybody who tries to guide me.</description>

<p>On the contrary there are plenty of employers, especially those with less formal employment practices, who will be impressed by the initiative you’ve taken.</p>
<p>Small business would be a primary example, and this is doubly so when you’re after your first job in the industry. Never discount a platform for demonstrating what you can offer in terms of skill set.</p>

<p>dude, it honestly literally doesn’t even matter. just write something you like, or something that is useful to <em>you</em> – frameworks, games, apis, small cli utilities, etc. contribute to existing open source software if you can (disclaimer: i don’t.) you can brag about it on your cv.</p>

<p>This. Employers want to see what kind of things you are interested and what you have worked on regardless of what it is. Every repo you create on GitHub makes you look good because you understand how to use version control (atleast at a basic level) and of course it’s always good to be involved in open-source.</p>
<p>If you want to be <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> cool, contribute to other open-source projects.</p>
