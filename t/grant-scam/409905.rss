So I got an email that says I have received a 500$ grant from a university in Tennessee, known as Vanderbilt, which is odd because I don&#39;t live in Tennessee or know anyone in Tennessee. I did some further research to find out that the person who emailed me, Stacey Maple, graduated from Yale. It was the only Stacey Maple I could find. Has anyone had anything like this?

The main thing I find odd is &quot;Daniel Richards&quot; email is an address from Yahoo and not from Vanderbilt. Any speculation?</description>

<p>Well I solved it. I guess if others should be warned…</p>
