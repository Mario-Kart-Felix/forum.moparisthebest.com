    <description>If you think this is going to be about the item.cfg slap yourself now... im not that stupid.

When i equip an item ingame for some reason the bonuses of the item won&#39;t load ... but ... if i ... say ... put on full rune then remove the helm the bonuses of the plate, legs, and kite would then show up I think im missing a method somewhere but I don&#39;t know which one if someone could post the method that adds bonuses when you put an item on it would be appreciated</description>
