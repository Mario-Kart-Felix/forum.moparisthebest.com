<p>Web development for 6 years and you’re still not finding it easy?<br>
Idk but I find web <span class="bbcode-b">design</span> extremely easy (right now anyway :P) but looking at the back end side of <span class="bbcode-b">development</span> I have not seen much (that I may need) to be some what expert level.</p>
<p>Could you tell me what you find difficult doing? I’m not much of a developer but I’m just curious.<br>

There are always different aspects of website design which could make it a lot more difficult. A lot of people (not me personally) struggle with CSS3 even to this day because it’s just not native to them. I didn’t say that I found anything about it difficult but it was a struggle getting here. Keeping up with the latest practices was a big pain for me, for example when PDO became a lot more well known. I really found it difficult to switch from using mysql_ functions to using prepared statements even though they’re much cleaner and really do improve the use of databases with PHP. It’s the little things that you’re not used to that throw you off guard. A big thing for me was also the use of OOP when using PHP, that was a pain to get used to. It’s just things like that, echoing a line obviously isn’t difficult but writing an entire content management system like none before isn’t going to be easy regardless of how many years someone’s been at it.[/quote]Yeah it can be difficult trying to design large websites properly, in regards to architecture and organization. It’s also sometimes difficult to stay up to speed on the best usability and other practices.</p>

Giving out your website is technically advertising. And please, next time you attempt a design, spend some time learning what your doing and spend time and work on it.</p>

<p>Guy’s I just wanted opinions not a bitch fit over who’s forums is better.  I know how to develop forums but when you only have FREE software at this time it can be very hard.  I am going to get vbulletin soon and I very much assure you they will be much better and web development is not very hard my little brother who’s 13 can do it.  Espically the hooks and plugins easiest shit ever.  I don’t get why everyone is having a fit though just wanted advice on what to change what to add ect.  For being a day old and having over 90 guests and 12 members join it cannot be to to bad since this is the only place I posted about it.  All big forums like mopar buy traffic to their site so members join I have many more forums to create for games I have a GTA 5 one coming out soon possibly a skyrim a NBA one a NHL one and much more just want ideas on what to use for software my other forums is www.diversityx.tk which is MYBB and my other forums is SMF identical to Mopar I guess but organized better hasn’t been used in a while though <a href="http://landofelements.com/smf/index.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://landofelements.com/smf/index.php</a></p>

<p>No, you need to read. If you didn’t notice you only quoted one line of what he posted. How about you learn to read and stop only seeing what you want to see. Criticize someone on some other post. He wanted opinions not for you to be butt hurt because he’s doing something that’s gonna be better then these shitty ass forums and rune-servers. Just quit life now if that’s all you’re gonna do. You think you know how to code or web design? Plz then show me lmfao. I’d love to see what you have. You’re no better then he is and will not get anywhere in life thinking you are. GG scrub. I’m done and you’re terrible. Get a life please and then come talk to me. Thank you.[/quote]I apologize - though Vain has always been known as a talented developer. You’re some random person out of nowhere whom makes false accusations. If you want just jump to dumbfounded conclusions - please, show us some of what you got.</p>
