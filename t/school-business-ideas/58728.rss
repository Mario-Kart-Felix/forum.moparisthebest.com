    <title>School business idea&#39;s?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/school-business-ideas/58728</link>
    <description>anyone have any idea&#39;s on what kinda business&#39;s you could run in a school ? 

Its basically for business studies coursework. I have a few but uh need some more interesting ones tbh. We brainstorm idea&#39;s, then choose one, need a total of 5 idea&#39;s.

Tuck shop - boring.
Games/dvd rental - hmm
Small year 11 &amp; form restaurant  - Ok for an idea, but im not going to choose as the business.
Hot healthy snack shop - Fits with jamie olivers expectations in schools now, but boring.
Stationary Shop - Good for an idea, but again not for doing.

We have to take into account the fact we have school lessons to go to...and the fact might not be able to rent out classrooms and such during lesson times, so we are limited, but can be used to an advantage :), especially with costs.

So ya, any idea&#39;s :)?</description>

              <p>Well, first a comical suggestion - sell answers to past test papers. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>A more serious suggestion - like regecks mentioned, soft drink. Back when I was one of those 14yr old junior students, soft drink cans were sold for $1 each on Friday sport afternoons.<br>
Everyone brought them, and they were always sold.</p>
<p>There’s a few advantages to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can buy in bulk - bulk buying power is often what can lead a business to prosperity, because it puts them in a more competitive position; they can sell for cheaper.</li>
<li>Soft drink isn’t like milk… If it wasn’t all sold, it’s safe to keep for next week.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now with a thing like soft drink, which is low risk (low risk like banking your money and collecting interest compared to share investments), you know that they will sell.<br>
So say you had a school of say… 1000, since you’re a high school student, and England (If you’re english :P) is a lot bigger country then Australia.<br>
You could expect at least 70% of those to buy soft drink at a dollar a can. What you could do, is buy direct from Coca Cola for several weeks at a time.</p>
<p>The above is assuming you have capital though. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>buy packs of candy,pops,chips,candy bars etc and sell them for cheap thats what we do in ours we are running this small store in school. like we buy lolipops for 15 for $1 (canadian) then sell em for 15 to 20 cents each mostely 15 where people thing its cheap. (btw its a highschool yea) another example pop cans you can buy 24 of em for like $6.50 then sell each for like 50 cents cender machines in schools charge 75cents. you can do like this to chips,candybars,can even make hotdogs and sell em (btw you don’t need much space too and the kids would buy it specially at lunch time (sell like jamican patties $1 each when only 12 costs $4.99 to buy in store) students always gets hungry so why not sell cookies they’ll buy it and eat it in class sell it like $1 for 2 cookies (manage you prices lol) and why noy gum everyone loves to chew gum while in class lol.)</p>

<p>I often wonder who the hell is behind this “what’s better for our children” crap. It seems their primary motivation is to appease moronic parents who don’t understand the issues at hand, and not actually care about the actual impact of their decisions. “AS LONG AS WE GET OUR BUDGET MONEY WE’RE HAPPY”.</p>
<p>So remember guys, next time you go to your canteen, be as much of an asshole to the cashiers (and any school administration staff) as possible, they work for very evil organizations whose primary concern is to corrupt schools and maximize their own profits.</p>

              <p>anyone have any idea’s on what kinda business’s you could run in a school ?</p>
<p>Its basically for business studies coursework. I have a few but uh need some more interesting ones tbh. We brainstorm idea’s, then choose one, need a total of 5 idea’s.</p>
<p>Tuck shop - boring.<br>
Games/dvd rental - hmm<br>
Small year 11 &amp; form restaurant  - Ok for an idea, but im not going to choose as the business.<br>
Hot healthy snack shop - Fits with jamie olivers expectations in schools now, but boring.<br>
Stationary Shop - Good for an idea, but again not for doing.</p>
<p>We have to take into account the fact we have school lessons to go to…and the fact might not be able to rent out classrooms and such during lesson times, so we are limited, but can be used to an advantage :), especially with costs.</p>
<p>So ya, any idea’s :)?</p>
