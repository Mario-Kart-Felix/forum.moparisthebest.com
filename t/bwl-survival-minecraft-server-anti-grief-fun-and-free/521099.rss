    <description>Welcome to BWL Servers. We are a group of friends running a Minecraft server for our and other&#39;s enjoyment. We hope you enjoy your stay. By default, you are in survival and you must play as you would normal Minecraft. If you donate, you can use creative, fly around, and many other features that are being added over time. 
 Feel free to jump on the server!
