    <description>Topic.

Doesnt RSDemon fudge an IP address to let multiple chars login the way aryan did? Is there a way we could figure out how to detect this code and pass it on to jagex? RSDemon really pisses me off :(</description>

              <p>Probably some people out there are still enjoying with working modified versions of Aryan lol.<br>
Anyway, if Themida is well made, and it probably is, your friend won’t be able to do anything without having a valid serial. Programs like Themida usually pack and encrypt the real code using part of the serial as a key, so that it is not possible to access it without one. Apart from that, Themida has some other features to make debugging harder, such as converting part of the real code to its own Virtual Machine code.</p>
<p>Note: Themida also has anti-debuggers, so you can’t really use CheatEngine, TSearch, or OllyDbg with it (at least in the normal way). I am not sure but probably Softice may still work, as it works on the kernel level.</p>

haha pathetic…</p>
<p>I sent the latest version to a buddy on MSN and he’s gunna try to unpack themida for me. Then I should be able to rename all the chinese shit with reshacker and crack it with my hexeditors.</p>
<p>It works in one of 3 ways (as far as I can figure):</p>
<ul>
<li>Runs off memory (Not sure about this, it was suggested)</li>
<li>Decrypts Packets (I really doubt it though)</li>
<li>They programmed a small virtual machine inside it (but I can’t see this being possible, the program itself is under 2mb)<br>
[/quote]</li>
</ul>
<p>Can’t wait to see what those hex editors can do. Do let us know if you find a way around Themida that’s less of a pain than manually.[/quote]<br>
I can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic or not, but anyway here is what I’ve tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically unpack Themida using UnThemida 1 &amp; 2. [Failed]</li>
<li>Crashes when you load it in OllyDBG.</li>
<li>Load it in XVI32, it loads but only thing readable is Themida <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I am trying to manually hand unpack themida <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> (wish me luck!)</p>

              <p>I’m sure it’s been said before, but Aryan wasn’t killed because of the information sent to Jagex. The information sent to Jagex was, firstly, an intentional move by the developers, not an accidental bug that caused it to be detectable. Secondly, Aryan worked during and after this if you thought to check the diff of the update and removed the detectable code yourself.</p>
<p>What killed the bot was a combination of lack of interest by people with the knowledge to continue the project and fairly large engine changes by Jagex.</p>

<p>Can’t wait to see what those hex editors can do. Do let us know if you find a way around Themida that’s less of a pain than manually.</p>

In any case, I have not been able to find anyone who knows how RSDemon works, or that wants to share that information. In any case, Jagex aren’t idiots, and there’s nothing you can really do to help them. Probably, they are already planning how to kill it anyway.</p>

<p>Doesnt RSDemon fudge an IP address to let multiple chars login the way aryan did? Is there a way we could figure out how to detect this code and pass it on to jagex? RSDemon really pisses me off <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
