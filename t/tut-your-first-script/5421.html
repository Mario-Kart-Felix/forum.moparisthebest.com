        <p>Hey! Infantry is here to teach you how to make your first script, an Auto Talker!</p>
<p><em>Also look for my next tut…Your First Auto Cutter!</em></p>
<p>You have been looking around at tutorials, but have had no success. The tutorials are good, but not what you have been looking for. You canâ€™t really seem to pull a script together. Well, thatâ€™s ok! Time to make your first script!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">=-----Basics-----=</span></p>
<p>Open up SCAR, and there should be some words ready to be turned into a script! It should look like this:</p>
<p><code> program New;
begin
end.</code></p>
<p>Now, where it says new, put whatever you want your program to be named. For this tutorial, we are going to be making an Auto Talker, so put:</p>
<p><code> program autotalker;
begin
end.</code></p>
<p>//This lets people know what your script is. Also, let me tell you about the â€œbeginâ€ and â€œend.â€ These are for your main loop. The main loop is what SCAR executes when the script is ready to go.\</p>
<p>Let me tell you about includes. They are pieces of code that give you easy-to-access function and procedures (covered later). The only living one, though, is the SRL, and it is an amazing include indeed! So this is how you well, include and include!</p>
<p>[code] program New;</p>
<p>{.include SRL\SRL.scar}</p>
<p>begin</p>
<p>end.[/code]</p>
<p>//You put the comment (covered later) above to let SCAR know to include that particular file in the script. Donâ€™t forget the period!\</p>
<p>Time to talk about constants. Constants are usually put in a script to be used as a setup. They are things you declare at the beginning of the script that stay true throughout the whole script. For this auto talker, you can make the constant the message you want to auto-talk. So put this inâ€¦</p>
<p>[code] program New;</p>
<p>{.include SRL\SRL.scar}</p>
<p>const<br>
SentenceToType=â€™Type Sentence Hereâ€™;</p>
<p>begin</p>
<p>end.[/code]</p>
<p>//Constant is abbreviated â€œconstâ€ in SCAR, so that is there to let scar know that thatâ€™s a constant. Because what we want to type is text, we put the apostrophes there to let SCAR know that itâ€™s a text string. Also, donâ€™t forget the semi-colon at the end of the constant!\</p>
<p>Now the next step is not required for this particular script, because you can put all of your procedure into your main loop, but I am putting it in to teach you. How nice of me :). We are going to make a <span class="bbcode-u">Procedure</span>! A procedure is part of a script that lets you call up on it later. So, this will be the procedure called â€œtalkâ€. Put this into your script:</p>
<p>[code] program New;</p>
<p>{.include SRL\SRL.scar}</p>
<p>const<br>
SentenceToType=â€™Type Sentence Hereâ€™;</p>
<p>procedure talk;<br>
begin<br>
end;</p>
<p>begin</p>
<p>end.[/code]</p>
<p>//This is always how you declare a procedure. The â€œbeginâ€ and â€œend;â€ here is like the main loop, except for the procedure.\</p>
<p>Now, it is time to use <span class="bbcode-u">Functions</span>â€¦ Functions are commands that are in SCAR (or includes, in this case) that you can use for your own devilish purposesâ€¦ :lol: Now, we can make a working procedure! If you look through the core of SRL, you will find hundreds of working functions and procedures. Most of them are very undetectable by Jagex. For today, we are going to be using the typing procedures. I find the procedure â€œTypeSendâ€ to be very effective. This is the procedure in SRL:</p>
<p><code> {*******************************************************************************
procedure TypeSend(Text: String);
By: Mutant Squirrle
Description: Types text humanlike using random timeing on keys.
*******************************************************************************}
procedure TypeSend(text:string);
var
  i: Integer;
begin
  for i := 1 to Length(Text) do
  begin
    TypeByte(GetKeyCode(Text[i]));
    Wait(50 + Random(120));
  end;
  wait(200 + Random(500));
  TypeByte(13);
end;</code></p>
<p>So as you can see, it types humanlike with random timing on keys. Now, to incorporate it into your script, put the procedure in like so:</p>
<p>[code] program New;</p>
<p>{.include SRL\SRL.scar}</p>
<p>const<br>
SentenceToType=‘Type Sentence Here’;</p>
<p>procedure talk;<br>
begin<br>
repeat<br>
TypeSend(SentenceToType+chr(13));<br>
Wait(750+random(250));<br>
Until(false)<br>
end;</p>
<p>begin</p>
<p>end.[/code]</p>
<p>//Notice the â€œrepeatâ€ and â€œuntil(false)â€ I put in there? That makes everything between <span class="bbcode-i">repeat</span> forever (because the condition for <span class="bbcode-i">until</span> is never met).</p>
<p>Notice instead of a text string next to TypeSend, I put in the name of the constant. This makes â€œTypeSendâ€ type whatever the constant â€œSentenceToTypeâ€ is. Also, donâ€™t forget the semi-colon! It is important for ending all procedures and functions.</p>
<p>Notice the â€œ+chr(13)â€ in the text string? That is used to press enter. Enter is designated as the character number 13 on the keyboard, so this is how you make the text send itself out. And, the wait time is, well, the wait time is how long you wait, of course!\</p>
<p>So now your script can type stuff! But you still need to add the talkl procedure to your main loop. This is how you add it:</p>
<p>[code] program New;</p>
<p>{.include SRL\SRL.scar}</p>
<p>const<br>
SentenceToType=‘Type Sentence Here’;</p>
<p>procedure talk;<br>
begin<br>
repeat<br>
TypeSend(SentenceToType+chr(13));<br>
Wait(750+random(250));<br>
Until(false)<br>
end;</p>
<p>begin<br>
ActivateClient;<br>
talk;<br>
end.[/code]</p>
<p>//ActivateClient is a procedure that is there so that people donâ€™t have to switch to the runescape screen right after you start the script.\</p>
<p>Congratulations! You have made a working script! Butâ€¦hehehe Iâ€™m not done with you yet!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">=-----Extras-----=</span></p>
<p>You can make a fully functioning script, but thereâ€™s more to it than that, isnâ€™t there! In this section, I will teach you about comments and progress reports.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Comments</span></p>
<p>Comments are little tidbits of information the author of the script puts in to help users understand what parts mean what. They are also overlooked by SCAR so they arenâ€™t incorporated into the script. There are two ways to do this:</p>
<p>~One</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">{Everything inside the curvy parenthesis is green in SCAR and is treated as a comment.}</code></pre>
<p>~Two</p>
<p>[code]//Everything on the same line as and after the double slash is a comment.</p>
<p>This is not a comment.[/code]</p>
<p>So lets put some comments in our script:</p>
<p>[code] {Welcome to my tutorial script! Hope you learned something from me!}</p>
<p>program New;</p>
<p>{.include SRL\SRL.scar}</p>
<p>//<em><strong><strong>SETUP</strong></strong></em>\<br>
const<br>
SentenceToType=‘Type Sentence Here’;<br>
//<em><strong>END SETUP</strong></em>\</p>
<p>procedure talk;<br>
begin<br>
repeat<br>
TypeSend(SentenceToType+chr(13));<br>
Wait(750+random(250));<br>
Until(false)<br>
end;</p>
<p>begin<br>
ActivateClient;<br>
talk;<br>
end.[/code]</p>
<p>//As you can see, I added the sentence at the top as a comment, as well as the little setup comment above and below the constants.\</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Progress Reports</span></p>
<p>I am sure that if you have used other peopleâ€™s scripts, you have seen the little box at the end that tells you how many monsters you have fought, randoms encountered, stuff like that. I can show you the path to take in order to make thoseâ€¦ yippe for me! Erâ€¦and youâ€¦</p>
<p>First off, you must have global variables declared at the top of your script.</p>
<p>~DETOUR~Variables are things that can vary, hence the name variables. To declare a variable, put them at the top. There are 3 types of variables: Integers, Strings, and Booleans.</p>
<p>~Integers</p>
<p><code>var
wordstyped:integer;</code></p>
<p>//Integers are numbersâ€¦duh. Thatâ€™s pretty much all you need to know. They can range from any negative to and positive, but must be a whole number.\</p>
<p>~Strings</p>
<p><code>var
wordstyped:string;</code></p>
<p>//Strings are text. Theyâ€™re placed within two apostrophes. Thatâ€™s it!\</p>
<p>~Booleans</p>
<p><code>var
wordstyped:Boolean;</code></p>
<p>//Booleans are one of two options; true or false.\</p>
<p>For this example, we will put â€œwordstypedâ€ as a variable. Now, to make wordstyped actually be words that have been typed, we must do this:</p>
<p><code>procedure talk;
begin
repeat
  TypeSend(SentenceToType+chr(13));
  wordstyped :=wordstyped + 1;
  Wait(750+random(250));
Until(false)
end;</code></p>
<p>//This will make the variable â€œwordstypedâ€ go up by one every time you type text and press enter.\</p>
<p>Now, make a procedure called â€œprogress reportâ€. For your progress report, you have to write into the debug box of SCAR. Let me show you how my progress reports look:</p>
<p><code> Procedure ProgressReport;
begin
  ClearDebug;
  Writeln('[]---////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\---[]');
  Writeln('         Thanks for using Infantry001s''s   ');
  Writeln('               Tutorial Auto-Talker             ');
  Writeln('       Worked for:' +ScriptTime2(2));
  Writeln('               Sentences typed:' +IntToStr(wordstyped));
  Writeln('[]---////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\---[]');
end;</code></p>
<p>//Writeln is a procedure that writes a text string into the debug box (the bottom box of SCAR). You can put it in any style you want.</p>
<p>ClearDebug is a command that, well, clears the debug box under SCAR!</p>
<p>ScriptTime2(2)) is a function I used (that is in SRL) to say how long I have worked for. You can find it in SRL\SRL\core\timing.scar.</p>
<p>IntToStr(wordstyped) is a function that returns the integer specified (in this case, the integer is wordstyped) into a text string. So here, it would result in â€œSentences typed: #â€.\</p>
<p>Time to make the progress report come out after specified increments! Add this stuff into your scriptâ€¦</p>
<p>[code]const<br>
progress=integer here    //How often in minutes you want your progress report to print out.</p>
<p>Begin  //Main loop<br>
SetTimeOut(progress * 60,‘ProgressReport’);<br>
ActivateClient;<br>
talk;<br>
end.[/code]</p>
<p>//Add the progress constant to allow users to choose how often a progress report prints out. Also, SetTimeOut is a function that allows you to set how often you use a procedure (procedure in this case, ProgressReport). Remember to make the procedure name a string!\</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">=-----Ending-----=</span></p>
<p>So I hope you have learned something from this tutorial! [size=1]You better have, or I spent my whole afternoon for nuthinâ€¦[/size] This is what your end product should look like:</p>
<p>[code] {Welcome to my tutorial script! Hope you learned something from me!}</p>
<p>program autotalker;</p>
<p>{.include SRL\SRL.scar}</p>
<p>var<br>
wordstyped:integer;</p>
<p>//<em><strong><strong>SETUP</strong></strong></em>\<br>
const<br>
SentenceToType=‘Type Sentence Here’;<br>
progress=1                             //How often in minutes you want your progress report to print<br>
//<em><strong>END SETUP</strong></em>\</p>
<p>procedure talk;<br>
begin<br>
repeat<br>
TypeSend(SentenceToType+chr(13));<br>
wordstyped :=wordstyped + 1;<br>
Wait(750+random(250));<br>
Until(false)<br>
end;</p>
<p>Procedure ProgressReport;<br>
begin<br>
ClearDebug;<br>
Writeln(’[]—////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\—[]’);<br>
Writeln(’         Thanks for using Infantry001s’‘s   ‘);<br>
Writeln(’               Tutorial Auto-Talker             ‘);<br>
Writeln(’       Worked for:’ +ScriptTime2(2));<br>
Writeln(’               Sentences typed:’ +IntToStr(wordstyped));<br>
Writeln(’[]—////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\—[]’);<br>
end;</p>
<p>begin<br>
SetTimeOut(progress * 60,‘ProgressReport’);<br>
ActivateClient;<br>
talk;<br>
end.[/code]</p>
<p>â€¦Or something to that degree :P. Thank you for reading, and I hope I have cast you on your way to SCAR scripting!</p>
