    <title>Missing something?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/missing-something/393727</link>
    <description>I have been working on a image cache format for my Gladiator game (easier loading, and more confusing for noobs who try to leech), and just recently an error has been throw on writing an image viewer for the new format (doing this before incorporating it into my game so I know it all appears correct in the new format). Just recently (like the last compile while adding a new class file only, not touching this method) an error has just showed up. I am positive I have not edited anything, but I could be wrong an am not noticing.

I am getting this error:[code]
com\coonhunter\datimgview\PicturePanel.java:14: incompatible types
found   : java.awt.Image
required: com.coonhunter.datimgview.Image
                imageBackground = i.getImage();
                                            ^
com\coonhunter\datimgview\PicturePanel.java:30: cannot find symbol
symbol  : method drawImage(com.coonhunter.datimgview.Image,int,int,&lt;nulltype&gt;)
location: class java.awt.Graphics2D
                                g2d.drawImage(imageBackground, 0, 0, null);
                                   ^

The &#39;setBackground(String img)&#39; method is actually going to be taken out as it as only tested for debugging on changing images, now that I have it able to unpack the imageCache into memory, I will be removing it.</description>

<p>Sadly, I didn’t think of this, since the same name is being used in another project. After looking though, it doesn’t use the java Image class. Feel stupid now lmfao, thanks for that.</p>
