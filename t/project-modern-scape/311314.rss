    <title>Project Modern Scape</title>

    <description>Hi, I am looking to making a team to make a successful server I have had server run by my self but since I couldn&#39;t host it went downhill because the hosters I had weren&#39;t very good like quit so I did not have up to date files ect but if i have a team that I could trust the server would be sucessful its called Modern Scape and its a server designed to be how people like it not over crowded and all that stuff.

Base - Delta (Don&#39;t let that put you off until you see the server)

What people i would want for the team...

Server Coders : To help code server a little - I do a lot of server coding my self.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Client Coders : Id like someone who knows quite a bit of client codes and could make a really good client.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advertisers : Well this sounds like a easy job, but I don&#39;t want someone who just will not do any work because Advertisers are important i do not expect you to pay for ad banners i expect you to set-up Modern Scape on vote sites ect and to Advertise in other ways you can think of too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Website Coder : This does not matter too much but if there&#39;s any that would like to do this job then that would be fine as long as you know what your doing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hoster : As I mentioned earlier I cannot host no more my self so I need a trusty, loyal and friendly hoster that can keep server uptime high.




If you take one of these jobs alls i can give you is a place in the staff, but if we have a team it will be successful and we will have players and then we could maybe get more serious with the server.
