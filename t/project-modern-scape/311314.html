        <p>Hi, I am looking to making a team to make a successful server I have had server run by my self but since I couldn’t host it went downhill because the hosters I had weren’t very good like quit so I did not have up to date files ect but if i have a team that I could trust the server would be sucessful its called Modern Scape and its a server designed to be how people like it not over crowded and all that stuff.</p>
<p>Base - Delta (Don’t let that put you off until you see the server)</p>
<p>What people i would want for the team…</p>
<p>Server Coders : To help code server a little - I do a lot of server coding my self.</p>
<hr>
<p>Client Coders : Id like someone who knows quite a bit of client codes and could make a really good client.</p>
<hr>
<p>Advertisers : Well this sounds like a easy job, but I don’t want someone who just will not do any work because Advertisers are important i do not expect you to pay for ad banners i expect you to set-up Modern Scape on vote sites ect and to Advertise in other ways you can think of too.</p>
<hr>
<p>Website Coder : This does not matter too much but if there’s any that would like to do this job then that would be fine as long as you know what your doing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hoster : As I mentioned earlier I cannot host no more my self so I need a trusty, loyal and friendly hoster that can keep server uptime high.</p>
<p>If you take one of these jobs alls i can give you is a place in the staff, but if we have a team it will be successful and we will have players and then we could maybe get more serious with the server.</p>
<p>Founder Of Team : Me<br>
Server Developer : —<br>
Client Developer : —<br>
Client Developer : —<br>
Advertiser : —<br>
Advertiser : —<br>
Hoster : —</p>
<p>Please Post here or contact my email at <a href="mailto:Carz_BBB@hotmail.co.uk">Carz_BBB@hotmail.co.uk</a> or go to my old Server website www.ModernScape.co.nr and post on forums there…</p>
<p>Thanks for listening hope you join…</p>
