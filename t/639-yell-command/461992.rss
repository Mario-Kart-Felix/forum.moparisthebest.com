    <title>639 Yell Command?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/639-yell-command/461992</link>
    <description>Ok, so i&#39;ve been working on my 639 server recently, and took a break for two to three months and totally forgot how to fix my ::yell command, to where everyone on the server can use it. haha now i know most of you are probably thinking &quot;what an idoit&quot;, haha and i would have to agree, but i don&#39;t feel like looking all over the place to figure this out, since it&#39;s probably not that big of a topic. So if anyone could help me out that would be amazing! A picture of the command will be below! :) 

Thanks, for who ever can help me! Haha i feel like such an idoit right now :P
