    <description>hello anyone reading this... i changed the color of my chat background to one that closely resembles that of the default blue... i poked around and found that it probably has something to do with method77 but i can&#39;t figure it out... it would be sweet if you could tell me how to switch it to black... thanks and have a good day</description>
