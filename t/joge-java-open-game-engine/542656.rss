    <title>JOGE - Java Open Game Engine</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/joge-java-open-game-engine/542656</link>
    <description>I started to work on my own open source game engine a while ago. Just to learn game engine architecture and design. My ultimate goal would be to make it into a general purpose game engine, but I have focused on FPS games in 3D so far. And I&#39;m sure I will continue that path.

The features of this game engine includes, but are not limited to, the following:


[ul][li]A Java2D based scan-line rasterizer, for 3D rendering.[/li]
[li]A camera that can be controlled in the 3D environment.[/li]
[li]Keyboard- and mouse input.[/li]
[li]A depth-cue rendering option.[/li]
[li]A wire-frame rendering option.[/li]
[li]Groups of polygons can be rotated and moved independently of others.[/li]
[li]A particle system, that currently only supports one type of particle, namely blood splatter.[/li]
[li]Point light sources.[/li]
[li]Shaded textures, created using the point light sources.[/li]
[li]A progress update screen, for loading resources and configuring a game.[/li]
[li]Map loading, currently only via XML-files.[/li]
[li]Toggling of mouse re-centering, useful for FPS games.[/li]
[li]Toggling of paused mode, in which various aspects of the game is not updated, but you can roam around.[/li]
[li]Toggling of a cursor, that is, you can show it or hide it.[/li]
[li]Toggling of FPS rendering.[/li]
[li]Toggling of texture rendering.[/li]
[li]A simple sound manager, with support for guitars, tones and byte arrays of sound data.[/li]
[li]Configurable map boundaries for X and Z, instead of real collision detection, as of yet.[/li][/ul]


A few days ago I GitHub:ed it, so it can be used in competitions, such as Ludum Dare. I did use it in the latest Ludum Dare 29. My game entry is called Surface Invaders and can be found in the links section below.

If anyone has any feedback or suggestions for improvement, features or critisism, please let me know.

<p>It’s excellent you are able to create something like this from scratch <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I just think (if this was a production ready game engine) that it would be better to keep it simple and compact, opposed to be so strung out. Preference maybe…? I just think the KISS principle is the only way to go with software like this.</p>
<p>Edit: If you’ve seen my 3D MORPG project, the original build was ridiculous. I was near 100 classes and only had the basics covered. It got to the point where I couldn’t add a simple piece of content without opening half of the source files…<br>
Needless to say, I copied the core functions and started from scratch again, porting the most useful code, and completely scrapping the rest - which was the greatest move I had made because since then I’ve been able to create large feature additions in no time at all. Now I always follow the KISS principle, and over complicated designs are a major turn off.<br>
Once again, preference maybe? I don’t know, I just think it’s wise to keep things basic… It could be 100 classes, or 10 classes, and still perform equally, but one will be easier to edit.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I usually follow strict rules when I program. For instance, I usually throw subclasses of RuntimeException for all invalid parameter arguments, like null or numbers that are out of range for the current task at hand. I also usually create many short methods that do one thing. That makes it easier to understand what a larger method does. If it is named well. Not to mention you can reuse the code in other methods in the same class.</p>
<p>However, I need as fast code as possible in this project. Having a lot of checks for invalid parameter arguments slows things down. Writing many small methods takes more time and I just want to make progress. And of course, it can also take longer to execute more methods, if they’re not inlined. But HotSpot will usually take well care of that, so that is not of great concern. I have actually experienced the opposite, that having many small methods can improve performance significantly. That has happened a few times in this game engine.</p>
<p>Other than that, I have tried to separate a lot of the different parts of the game engine. But it can always be improved more. I try to keep away from package level dependency cycles (both direct and indirect ones).</p>

              <p>xEthanx: I believe you already can create games like that. Just fix the camera to view the map from the side and move it to the left or right as the player moves. The effect is practically the same. You can practically also create RTS games by keeping the camera from top down in a fixed way. One thing needed for it is probably a way to get the mouse position on the screen, but that’s easily added to the engine. I also need to add sprite support I guess. Currently I got textured polygons with transparent backgrounds as characters.</p>
