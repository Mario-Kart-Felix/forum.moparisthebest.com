    <title>&quot;For&quot; and &quot;Foreach&quot; loops PHP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/for-and-foreach-loops-php/542714</link>
    <description>Okay this might be a really stupid question but I am starting to learn PHP on CodeCademy (Which I Highly recommend) and I am starting to learn loops now in PHP. I am really confused on if their is even a difference between a &quot;for&quot; loop and a &quot;foreach&quot; loop. Is it that in a &quot;foreach&quot; loop that you can rename the variable or whatever? Idk but an explanation would be great for this noobie question  :palm: ;D</description>

<p>Thank you so much!! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> this helped so you are saying that  a “for”  with the  3 expressions are after each semicolon?</p>

Exactly.  However that code would only execute once (kinda pointless using a loop <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ), if you wanted it to execute 11 times then the ‘modifier’ would be <span class="bbcode-i">$i++</span>, which just increments the value of $i by 1.</p>
<p>Also worth mentioning that you can simulate a foreach loop with a for loop by using <span class="bbcode-i">$i &lt; count($array)</span> as the condition.[/quote]</p>
<p>Could you give me your skype so if I have an questions you could help? I dont want to be spamming forums with constant questions all the time <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
