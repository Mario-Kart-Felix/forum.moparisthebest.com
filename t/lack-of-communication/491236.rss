    <title>Lack of communication</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lack-of-communication/491236</link>
    <description>I understand that this thread may well be locked. Opinions here are my own.

I wish to raise the issue of the lack of communication of Adminstraitors with the members of this community. Admins, Global Mods, Sectional Mods, friends across the forum, first of all let me tell you that in my opinion you guys are doing an excellent job. I would be first to compliment you on your skills of handling threads, spambots, trollers etc. Nothing in my mind questions your authority or your competence.

However, you often leave members in the dark regarding updates to the forum. For example, since december in the Official News posts, a topic regarding &quot;No more server basics&quot; has been bumped continuously. 2 months later, no action has been taken and nobody here has a clue if this rule is being applied or not. 

Another example is that a while back, a member suggested a request section since the takedown of many files and the flop of Megaupload. At the time, Taharok responded enthusiastically. Nothing was ever followed through. 

Rules are not being updated. I have messaged Taharok about this before with no reply. I feel I should make it a public post and see what you guys have to say about feeling left in the dark.</description>

<p>I thought that was a given, that’s why I said we’d need 3/4 moderators for the requests section alone because people simply couldn’t give a huge chunk of their time for it :P. If they’re really struggling for people to do it I wouldn’t have a problem putting up with stuff like that, and I think there’d be a few others who’d just brush it off too.

<p>Like I said to Tom a few posts back, we’d really need to look into it. I’ve never really thought about it. They’d need to meet certain criteria of course:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Achieve the right to get into the staff team as is[/li]<br>
[li]Be extremely active on the site[/li]<br>
[li]Be well respected by a lot of the members so it could rub off onto the lesser known community[/li]<br>
[li]Not be afraid to take action upon one of their friends if wrongdoing was going on[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The list could be endless.</p>

<p>I think with the correct amount of moderation it could work out nicely, but it’s going to take at least 3/4 sectional moderators for that alone. I suppose that wouldn’t be a bad thing though, because they could be sectional elsewhere too and help keep that clean. Like I put in my last post, there’d need to be a strict set of rules for the requests section and the moderators would have to rule it with an iron fist, no leniency at all could be given just because it could potentially end up in malware and malicious files on our site :o. It could be done though, if the correct moderators were picked :P.</p>

<p>Moderating posts in the downloads section would be a massive pain for moderators. A lot of topics are created there daily, so you’d need a fair bit of man-power for it. I think the negatives outweigh the benefits for this idea in my opinion…</p>

That’d need a lot of dedicated sectionals though, as you stated. I know a hell of a lot of people would be posting requests, could easily see it being as much as 20-30 a day. If 20-30 downloads a day were to be checked we’d have a hard time having the staff to do that. I think we’d just need to have strict rules and have the sectional moderators enforce those rules with an iron fist.</p>

A new wave of staff should be promoted starting requirement 7k posts or more<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yes because postcount is always the answer[/quote]^ most of those with 7k are either inactive, the largest trolls, or really shouldn’t be allowed in general</p>

<p>Couldn’t agree more here Caleb, couldn’t agree more. I think the sectional moderators could cut down on the number of reports and with the recent drop in moderators then I doubt it could hurt to give them a try <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Here are my two cents (which are just thoughts):</p>
<p>• We should have sectional moderators in the RS2 section, not only for rule breaking but to give decent feedback to the members of this community. It’s always nice when you see a moderator telling you did a good job.</p>
<p>• I think a new active admin should be looked into.</p>
<p>• We the staff are trying to meet up more frequently so things will actually get done here.</p>
<p>• I’ve talked to Taharok about the suggestions board, but he said he’d need a substantial amount of time to not only figure what’s wrong, but to fix it. The suggestions board was a great way to spread ideas.</p>
