    <title>Lucid Dreaming</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lucid-dreaming/1561</link>
    <description>Hey, if you don&#39;t know what lucid dreaming is, it&#39;s the ability to control your dreams. 

I&#39;m sure most of you have experienced this at least once, I know I have many times however in the morning I wonder why I didn&#39;t do things I always wanted to do, so obviously I&#39;m not in total control.

Believe it or not, it is possible to train yourself for lucid dreaming, I have been training for 2 years and I have learnt a lot. Whether you think it or not, you have many many dreams every night. If you think you don&#39;t, your wrong, you just simply cannot remember them. Nowadays I can remember at least 3-5 dreams every night. Someday I hope to have lucid dreams at my will, because I could then accomplish anything. Not only can you control your dreams, but you can control how long you stay in them as well. Obviously not forever, but some are able to spend several hours in a dream, doing as they wish. 

Obviously some are going to choose not to believe this, but all I can say is that I have had the experience several times and it is amazing. 

So... You can search google for information on training, but before doing so you need to do a lot of stuff. Make sure you get a good nights sleep, every night. 8 hours is a good amount, 10 is even better(weekends are usually good for this). In the morning, write down your dreams if you can remember any. Do this EVERY morning. You need to find a pattern in your dreams, or a re-occuring event. It really helps a lot to do this. For me, swimming pools and long dark hallways seem to happen almost everynight. And, without the ability to remember your dreams you cannot remember if you have had a lucid dream. If you wake u in the middle of the night, jot down part of your dream and see if you can recall the whole thing in the morning. Jot down Who, where, what, and when. Eventaully you&#39;ll find a common element in all your dreams, which I believe are called dream signs. Now if you want, go search google for some tips and guides on lucid dreaming, but you HAVE TO master remembering your dreams before doing so. 

So, disucss what you feel on lucid dreaming. I have a feeling many people here will flame me or something, but at least give it a try. Try doing this for like 2 weeks, and come back if you notice any trends. Someday I hope to be able to control my dreams, Im not far from it either.

Discuss what you think!</description>

              <p>Well I never thought this community would believe in something like this. Although I want to experience it I’ve never tried lucid dreaming; I would never get into the habit of checking the time every 5 minutes etc. But from an article in phrack I found out that for an out of body experience sometimes it is good to just let yourself fall backwards and do not make any attempt to stop yourself. Of course you have to make sure your actually dreaming to do this, but the writer claimed to have gone downstairs in his dream seen his girlfriend on the couch and memorised the scene. As he went down stairs later it was exactly the same.</p>
<p>If anybody wants any of my resources on the subject just ask and I will post as Ive came across a few in my time on the internets I also have some hypnotism ones.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be a good idea to make a dream board or perhaps an “occult” section It would be nice to discuss things like this without all the weirdos that think their vampires etc that generally plague that kind of forum.</p>

<p>i see, well anyway i wanna try astral hearing first, so i’m focusing on chakra sounds.</p>
