I&amp;#39;m sure most of you have experienced this at least once, I know I have many times however in the morning I wonder why I didn&amp;#39;t d&amp;hellip;">

<p>Anyway, back on-topic is there anyway for me to remember my dreams? I wouldn’t mind waking up at 5 in the morning it is just my mum and dad would get pissed with my alarm going off every night.</p>
<p>If this is any help to answer as to why I can’t remember dreams, here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>I spend ALOT of time at the computer. Well over 8 hours a day.</li>
<li>I’m not really stressed but do get frustrated very easily.</li>
<li>I listen to the radio at night and fall asleep with it on</li>
<li>I think about life when I go to sleep.</li>
<li>I sometimes watch TV before sleeping</li>
<li>I sometimes read before sleeping.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am really liking the idea of Lucid Dreaming but needing to remember my dreams is the first step, which I can’t do.</p>

        <p>What I did to remember most of my dreams is say “I will remember my dream when I wake up” like 50 times over. Then I go to sleep. It works <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Or, you can have your cellphone vibrate ( I usually set it on a shelf. It makes you wake up easily ) as an alarm, at around 3:00AM. Then you should remember where you were at in your dream.</p>

<p>Well, I’d say for the past two years or so I can NEVER (and I mean never) remember my dreams. Heck, it’s like not even having any, even though I know I have them. This is so frustrating as I love dreams. I recently remember having a nightmare. The nightmare was related in something very close to me that I don’t want to get in to, but I knew the nightmare was a possible reality.</p>
<p>Anyway, back on-topic is there anyway for me to remember my dreams? I wouldn’t mind waking up at 5 in the morning it is just my mum and dad would get pissed with my alarm going off every night.</p>

<p>I’m no dream expert <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>But, your diet has a lot to do with dream recall. If your a vegetarian then it’ll be very diffacult, it’s good to eat lots of meat. Also, just like me, it took me like a month before I could start remembering dreams at all. You’ve got t want it and think about it every night. When you wake up, do your best not to move and keep your eyes closed and try to remember anything at all, however thats easier said then done. But it’ll become a daily routine for your mind every day after you do it for a while.</p>

        <p>NOTE: i dont want any flames bout spelling or stuff cuse UK engilish isent my first language and if you want then stick it throuh a spellchecker… i thought there was one on here but i cant find it if there is and you can point out how then ill go through it</p>
<p>iv always had a very good connection with myself and have been teaching myself to have lucid dreams for over 7 years and although i ownly read the first 3 pages and the last one most of the posts are eather entirely fake, they are mistaken ( happens a lot where you think about the dream and what happens and it goes that way but you dont have actual lucidity or controle), iv found a mine of dreamers when theres on avrage 1 in 87 (most recent estimate) that can actualy lucid dream or your all on drugs…</p>
<p>Everyone has the ability to lucid dream but there is a large exstent than others and some pepol will have perhapse 1 in 1-3 years withought learning to… for exsample one of my partners can lucid dream but bairly after 3 years of trying but my other 3 can do it nearly reliably</p>
<p>lots of pepol have trouble lucid dreaming so here are some tips…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>if you cant lucid dream at all try meditation to start with( dosent need to be spiritual just be able to feel and be in balance with your body it isent necsecery but it is very helpfull for more advanced dream control)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>always be very comftable when you start to sleep, stess realy messes it up but so dose listening to music or tunes that have a tune you can memorise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sounds stupid but learn to sleep when you want ( i can normaly go to sleep while im rested within 15 secs )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dont try to force a dream to be lucid, being aware of it is enought to start and if you fight against it and your conchusness then it wont come. first be aware of it then try to change it gently ( as if your trying not to scare a fish in the water, you dont want to cause ripples or move too fast)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Lucid dreaming isent jumping out of a window and turning into superman, if your actualy aware in a dream and able to concusly influance it it cant go against what you would exspect in RL!</p>
<p>If you keep wakeing up from a lucid dream then here are some tips…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>always yeild to a dream dont fight it, it must be something your subconchus can rationalise!<br>
( like some pepol did a test on lobotomised or something pepol and after getting a reaction the pepol had an rationalisation such as suddenly wanting a drink or needing to have a shower for standing up.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leading on from point 1 lots of pepol want to when they have slight controle over their dreams, to walk through a wall or a mirror and they cant do it which makes them unbalanced and they therefore wake up. the way to solve this is to imagen the mirror to be something like gel or water instead of solid untill they have much greater control. however this means genraly they end up at the bottem of a swimming pool or the sea and panic so wake up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you can exsperiance things like sex ext but if you dont know the feeling then it can cause doubut and that can wake you up the same with shooting or being shot, the same is if you are hurt then it wakes you up unless you are used to dreams like it or dont have enought controle to be lucid enought to realise it</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>tripping and sleep paralisis…</p>
<p>appart from convinceing americans they have been abducted by alianse ( out of a servey of ‘abduction victims’ 89% of them had the same effects that sleep paralisis had and another 3% claimed to have had a babie/babies stolen when they havent even been pregnent) sleep paralicis was evolved from mamilion rodents which dident want to sleepwalk out of their burrows and be eaten so it locks the body up and ‘tripping’ is what happens when this ends while your asleap so your legs can move and wake you up ( that and a broken foot is what lead me to lucid dreaming ) and wakeing sleep paralis or ‘alian disorder’ is the same in reverse.</p>
<p>Further lucid dreaming…</p>
<p>After you have got to the stage where you are aware of yourself and then are able to affect small things in your dreams it can go on to larger things… as i said before you cant just magicly fly around or walk throuh walls unless your drugged out of your mind ( which normaly means your dead from trying to fly off a building when you think your actualy lucid dreaming ) but you can do things in your body if it makes sence to your mind, instead of imagening your somewhere else to start with if your in a room open a door to somewhere for exsample a kitchen in your house, it makes sence to you becuse your opening a door in a room to another room and do things like that. at this stange in how well you can lucid dream then you shouldent be in total controle still as to do it reliably then it takes much more practace than this type of thing.</p>
<p>After this then you should be able to open a cubord or something simmiler but if you wake up try it again another night and you sould be able to progress from there but you still should not be able to have total controle for a long time reliably</p>
<p>Advanced Lucid dreaming</p>
<p>This is what im most comftable with, its a more controled form of lucid dreaming… it is more like a blend between total conchusniss which wakes you up and being able to manipulate your dreams where you have total controle over your body but it is limited to the point you cant suddenly get a jetpack and start a massica, you need at this point to have very good controle over your concus mind in your dreams as withought it then you will almost certinly drop out of sleep again unless you are in a very relaxed and famillier surroundings such as like some pepol have sugestd screwing your partner. this is almost the opposit of out of body exsperiance, it is where you can feel your body exsactly, often more than you feel it awake as you have no outside distractions and you are so in tune with yourself.</p>
<p>To accheave this you need to be barly lucid… sounds the wrong way around but it allows you to exsperiance your body and controle the dream withought feeling like a marionett or such and insted feel almost dreamless or soft like if your floating in thick warm water… a good way to get used to this is if your a comftable swimmer to use a snorcal mask and breath in a halfish breath and float on your back underwater with your eyes cloased.</p>
<p>btw it is very unlikely to have a lucid dream more than 2-3 times a week even if your very good at it and nomatter how good your dream recolection is you are gunna miss some</p>

        <p>No offense but that is a load of bull. First, learn to spell better than an average 9 year old. Second, you CAN do just about anything in a lucid dream. You can start flying, or walk through a wall, or what ever you like, but it will take practice.</p>

        <p>Faile, if you want to do something, just believe and expect it to happen. If you jump and force yourself to believe that you will not fall back down to earth, then you wont.</p>
<p>About the wall thing, I have never done it because the thought never really crossed my mind. But I do know it could be done with practice, if you really wanted to do it for some reason. Not that it would accomplish anything.</p>

</aside>
<p>by that i ment in 7 years of lucid dreaming i havent known anyone to have done it</p>
<p>Zach – genraly its akin to knowing something can be done in wakeing life allows your mind to be open to the idea, it might be you have a very open mind which due to life i lost early but just beliveing rarely works becuse pepol have all ran into walls as children ( or in my case ran into a powersaw ) and have got used to not being able to go through walls which is why the door tequneak is used or thinking of the wall or in the case of the mirror in the first post as something you can walk through such as pushing through water as nobody that i know of has the exsperiance of walking through a stone and mortar wall…</p>
<p>its basicly the same as being shot or dieing ( sounds strange but it is ) in a unconcus dream then it dosent always wake you up but in a lucid dream it is something that your mind cannot call to mind easly unless its happend so while there are ways of doing it you cant just walk into what your mind thinks of as rock and walk through it like air while still thinking of it as a wall</p>

<p>In dream control, you can literaly do anything you want. You don’t try to do things, you just do them. A key principal is to KNOW that you can walk through a wall, not just hope that you can. Your right that once you become lucid you cant just control everything, but with practice you can. Many many people can do whatever they want at all, I’ve had quite a few of thes experiences now.</p>
<p>Anyways, not sure what you mean by 1 out of 87 people can do it, everyone, and I mean everyone, has the ability, and the majority pick up a lucid dream in just a few months(but not to the point where they can do it every night). But I’m having a really hard time understanding you, I give up on trying to read your posts. No offence, and i know english isn;t your first language, but it’s pretty damn near unbearable and I think you should practice it a little bit more <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Anyways, I remember once in a lucid dream I wanted to go to the basement some reason. So I pretended there was a doorway on the other side of a chain link fence. So I basically walked through the fence and somehow I was by a staircase (I tried to imagine it without the fence but I had troubles).</p>

In dream control, you can literaly do anything you want. You don’t try to do things, you just do them. A key principal is to KNOW that you can walk through a wall, not just hope that you can. Your right that once you become lucid you cant just control everything, but with practice you can. Many many people can do whatever they want at all, I’ve had quite a few of thes experiences now.<br>

Thank you, thats what I wanted to hear. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Anyways, I remember once in a lucid dream I wanted to go to the basement some reason. So I pretended there was a doorway on the other side of a chain link fence. So I basically walked through the fence and somehow I was by a staircase (I tried to imagine it without the fence but I had troubles).[/quote]</p>
<p>yeh… as in zach’s case its simmiler that you needed to use a doorway at the fence but not able to do it when its not got a fence your mind needs something to hang on to if i understand what your saying</p>
<p>jme what i mean by 1 in 87 have a good degree of control sry i wasent clear on that and i know i have a block on walls ( its hard to imagen walls as being able to walk through when one collapsed on you :P)</p>
<p>out of intrest when you walk through a wall then what happens? do you just come out on the other side? if its a 3 meter thick wall and you just stick your head in do you see the inside of the wall?</p>
<p>Anyway again on the language thing… russion has lots more diffrances wth engilish than other languages and letters that arnt even used in engilish and iv never had much luck with others. i have been learning it for a while but im a traveler and am currently learning also french, german, spanish and dutch which are all easyer than engilish so you can understand why its hard for me <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>btw whats Love Hina?</p>
