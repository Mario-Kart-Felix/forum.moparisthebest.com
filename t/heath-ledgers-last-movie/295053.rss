    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/heath-ledgers-last-movie/295053</link>
    <description>Plot:
A traveling theater company gives its audience much more than they were expecting. 


Watch the Trailer Below.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jU3AimFaz0&amp;feature=player_embedded


Colin Farrell, Johnny Depp, &amp; Jude Law all stepped in to help finish Heath Ledgers final film &quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot; Farrell recently had this to say about taking on the role &quot;It was a very difficult decision to make, when I first heard about it I totally freaked at the idea, But it was important to get Heaths work out and doing what I think Heath would have wanted, which was finishing the movie to its entirety.&quot; 


HOW NICE?
Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law gave all the income they received for this movie to Heath Ledger&#39;s daughter Matilda so that her economic future would be secure.


Im excited, 
Hbu?</description>

              <p>Yes, Its very interesting looking at the preview. However I like how heath ledger played the role in it.<br>
Ive always liked his acting. Since his first movie he made (were he was a gay fag). But still the storyline is<br>
interesting.</p>
