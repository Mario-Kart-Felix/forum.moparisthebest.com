    <title>[Pi] NPC&#39;s with no size [Pi]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-npcs-with-no-size-pi/543695</link>
    <description>Alright guys, so I figured out that my NPC&#39;s do not have size. What I mean by that is that they all think they are the size of a small creature like a man. So for instance, dragons can run through spaces that they are too big for but since a man could fit through the space, the dragon runs through it. Also, when the dragons are attacking you, they will run over you and be standing on top of you when they are fighting the player. All the NPC&#39;s are this way. The only NPC&#39;s that seem to work right are the small creatures like men or those small level 1 rats. How can I make my NPC&#39;s know that they are bigger than what they seem?</description>

<p>That’s not the only issue.<br>
He is right talking about the NPC size issue.</p>
<p>Depending on the clipping, you need the sizes regardless.</p>
