    <title>RSPS Programmers/Coders Needed. [VPS READY]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-programmers-coders-needed-vps-ready/536031</link>
    <description>This has been a long project for me and my partners for quite some time now, but up until recently we had to remove our coder due to lack or effort. 

[u][b]What I am offering:[/b][/u]
I will handle all hosting related manners. We will be running the server testing from our VPS.
I am familiar with registering domains.
I do have an allowed budget for this product, and I do have income.
When the server gains popularity, we will split the profits fairly. I am not looking for a get cash quick scheme, I am genuinely looking to start a successful community. You will also all receive Admin permissions on server and forums. 

I will be available to my team almost 24/7 and will distribute my mobile number to them after things have been finalized.

I am not in full time employment. I do have time to learn how to develop a server, but I am just looking for a team to handle server and client side of things. 

I would like a developer who is capable of linking the forum user database with the users from the server.

If you have the skills for the job, but don&#39;t like the terms, contact me anyway. It can&#39;t hurt to talk and see if we can work something out. 

Aside from experience, the only trait I&#39;m looking for is maturity, and possibly age. 

Please contact me via Skype: King.Lxa

Thanks.</description>
