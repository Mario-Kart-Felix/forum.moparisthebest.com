    <title>E-ink readers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/e-ink-readers/422871</link>
    <description>What with it being black friday and all, I was looking into these. I currently use my phone to read books, but it&#39;s damaged so the battery doesn&#39;t last very long and the screen is kind of small. I was looking at e-ink readers and thought they seemed pretty cool, although a bit one-purposed. But I figure if I could get a cheap one, it wouldn&#39;t be that big of a deal.
I&#39;m not looking for much, but I need a few things:


[ul][li]epub support - this is what stops me from thinking kindle[/li]
[li]ability to work with books i download/convert from the computer - this is what gets me worried with the nook/kindle, not sure if i could do this[/li]
[li]long battery life[/li]
[li]able to be put in my book bag without being damaged[/li]
[li]preferably not too expensive/on sale[/li]
[li]nice, readable size/resolution[/li][/ul]


i don&#39;t really care about other features like wifi or 3g or an internet browser, all that really matters is what i have eabove. Especially the first two, I have no intention of buying books and if it can&#39;t handle converted ones that I load myself it&#39;s useless to me. 
EDIT: Oh, but being able to read the news would be amazing - not necessary, but really cool.
EDIT2: Would I be better off getting a cheap off brand android tablet? I guess it would be nice to have the added functionality, but the cost would be battery life/distractions from reading/screen issues.</description>

reading with it is very nice, i’m using aldiko reader instead of the stock nook software. i’m trying to figure out how to get the hardware page turn buttons to work for that though</p>

              <p>I saw that and it looked pretty nice, but I ended up getting a nook touch. It came with a $20 supposedly no questions asked replacement policy for two years, which is amazing for me. I’m really happy with it so far, I’ve rooted it so I can install other android apps + loaded a bunch of books this morning. The only issue I’ve had was with the wifi but that’s probably my router acting up. I’ll use it a bit more later today at the university if I have time.</p>

              <p>The PRS-650 looks really nice, but it’s kind of expensive, I’m already pushing it sort of with the lower priced ones. I’m thinking probably either a kobo touch or a nook touch, if I can find some good reviews for a kindle touch I might get that. I like the features of the kobo (apart from the social things, I doubt I’d use those) but if the nook touch can be rooted to use any android reader/opera mobile I might lean towards that. I also want to see how the rooting goes with it/if it’s worth it, and I want to look into the kindle touch a bit more. I’ve previously used calibre only briefly, I’ll definitely look into it more though.</p>
<p>EDIT: The kindle touch doesn’t look too good. After looking into it a bit more, I think I have to go with the nook touch. I really like the features and design of the kobo touch, but being able to root the nook touch and directly access news/web (at least over wifi) makes me want it more. I wish the case was designed better, but the functionality is hard to beat. I might change my mind in the days before I buy it though <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>I have a Sony PRS-650, and I love it. I recently found a large collection of new, Dutch books that are all in e-pub format. I have around 3-4k books now, so I won’t need to buy any books in the coming years.</p>
<p>E-pub or similar support is a must. My reader can handle pdf files, but it can only resize the entire page, so it cuts off the corners. Calibre is a great program. You can make it download RSS feeds and it will convert them to an e-pub file with a nice index and all.</p>

<p>The Kobo e-reader supports epub and they’re around the same price as a kindle.</p>
