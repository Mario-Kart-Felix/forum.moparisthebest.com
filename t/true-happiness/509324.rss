    <title>True Happiness</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/true-happiness/509324</link>
    <description>Reading the book &quot;Brave New World&quot; gave me this thought.

What is true happiness?

For those who haven&#39;t read Brave New World I&#39;ll give you a quick run through;

There is this society in which people are conditioned from birth to love their job. Some of the jobs are horrible jobs but since the people have been genetically &quot;dumbed-down&quot; and conditioned, they love it. If someone is not so very happy, they take a soma, a drug that makes you hallucinate and be happy with no need to recover from it. (Like alcohol without the hangover). These people are kept ignorant of history and certain sciences that do not agree with their Society. Also, in this society, everyone belongs to everyone. If you want to have sex with Person A one night and Person B another night, it is applauded. Sex with one person over a period of time is frowned upon. There is no marriage.

Are these people truly happy?</description>

<p>A lot of porn stars actually dislike their job (to a certain extent). It’s fun at first, but think of how your penis feels when you perform in 2 scenes a day, multiple days a week.</p>

<p>I’ve read about people hallucinating then seizing up on DXM. Definitely don’t do it.[/quote]<br>
You my friend, were reading from a certainly unreliable source. or DARE.<br>
DXM, for the most part is actually proven harmless and will not give you seizures. This is a misconception!<br>
It’s the source that people are receiving this drug from that is the problem, cough medicine.<br>
More often than not, kids use triple c’s (coricidin cough &amp; cold) as there source for the drug which contains other nasty and unwanted ingredients like actomenophin and gaufisin. Some people such as myself are naturally immune to gaufisin, others that are not, even at the tiniest dosage for example 50mg, will have terrible vomiting. However, you cannot die from it. You’ll just wish you didn’t take it.</p>
<p>Actemenophin on the other hand will destroy your kidneys faster than you can blink.</p>

              <p>I don’t believe you need a family to be truly happy, it is just an idea people believe. You can be truly happy by yourself doing something you enjoy, such as a fun job where every day is different. It depends on the person in question who determines true happiness rather then the situation. Personally i don’t see this example of true happiness correct, where as someone else may. There is always two sides to everything, it just depends on which side you see acceptable.</p>

<p>of course the people in the brave new world universe are happy, relative to their societal standards, which is why <em>spoilers, copy and paste into the quick reply box or something</em> [size=1pt]the guy from the reservation ended up killing himself, his view of happiness, his love of literature and wanting a single lover, all his views of happiness were radically different to the happiness of a society where high-class people view happiness as orgies and drugs, as opposed to the lower-class society which are genetically modified to like menial tasks[/size]</p>
<p>if I took anything from that book it’s that happiness is what you make of it, so long as society agrees you will be accepted, if not you will be shunned [size=1pt]I loveing loved the ending of that book though, the movie on the other hand BUTCHERED the ending[/size]</p>

<p>No families. Saying “Mother” in this society is the equivalent of saying sodomy or something.</p>

<p>What difference does it make? As long as you believe you are happy, you are happy. Sort of like the Matrix.</p>
<p>Also, I forgot to add that there are some people born into “reservations”, this society is similar to Native American society.</p>

<p>A guy from the reservations sees this the Soma-Society and ends up killing himself.</p>

              <p>Reading the book “Brave New World” gave me this thought.</p>
<p>What is true happiness?</p>
<p>For those who haven’t read Brave New World I’ll give you a quick run through;</p>
<p>There is this society in which people are conditioned from birth to love their job. Some of the jobs are horrible jobs but since the people have been genetically “dumbed-down” and conditioned, they love it. If someone is not so very happy, they take a soma, a drug that makes you hallucinate and be happy with no need to recover from it. (Like alcohol without the hangover). These people are kept ignorant of history and certain sciences that do not agree with their Society. Also, in this society, everyone belongs to everyone. If you want to have sex with Person A one night and Person B another night, it is applauded. Sex with one person over a period of time is frowned upon. There is no marriage.</p>
<p>Are these people truly happy?</p>
