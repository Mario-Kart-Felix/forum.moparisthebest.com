    <description>1. IP Tracker on character file
Does any one know how to add IP to character data and make it keep track of last IP used to log on. I want to have a thing where it tells me who&#39;s IP last logged into the account so that I may prevent cheating. 

2. Friend&#39;s list not working 100%
I am not really sure if this is client or server-sided. I was told that the friend&#39;s list is broken on PI, like when you add someone, it stays either Green or Red even when it doesn&#39;t correspond. Ex. When someone is one, the added person&#39;s name is in Red. Any one know how to fix? I been given a fix before, but it turns its green rather than red even when they were on.

3. Improved player command
Does anyone know how to track who&#39;s online? Like the command :: players shows you how many people are online and I want to know who is online, something similar to the cPanel on some delta sources.

4. PM log/Chat log/CC log/Trade log/Command logs and whatever else you can think of
A way to save whatever people type in a PM into a text file. Same for the rest.</description>
