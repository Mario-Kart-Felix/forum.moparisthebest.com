    <title>ZBrush Contest #1</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/zbrush-contest-1/236935</link>
    <description>
This is open to ANYONE. No experience needed as this is a completely new learning experience. I haven&#39;t seen any work in this program besides mine so I&#39;m assuming no one else has used it.

ZBrush information:
Digital sculpting. Think of a 3D modeling program as mainly for hard surfaces. Not organic things. Now think of ZBrush as organic based modeling. No modeling whatsoever. A completely new realm. With brushes and other tools it mixes Photoshop 2D design with 3D modeling for 2.5D design. You can sculpt your models like never before.

This should be a learning experience. Think of it like that more than a contest. If you need ZBrush let me know I can provide links if you srsly can&#39;t find them yourself.

What this will be about:
Creatures.
I want some form of a creature. Everything else is up to you. No real render is required but that is very above and beyond this. An image straight out of ZBrush is fine. Let your creativity go to work here.

Here&#39;s a few quick tutorial since most of you won&#39;t know what to do.
I&#39;d recommend working with ZSpheres for the body and then adding on from there, but it&#39;s your choice.
http://www.pixologic.com/zclassroom/homeroom/
Look in basics, ZSpheres, and any other if you&#39;re interested.

This will be a ongoing &quot;contest.&quot; It will be open for a very long time. As many entries as you want. Anyone can enter as long as it&#39;s a ZBrush character.

Hell, you could model a small character and import him into ZBrush and then sculpt him. I will probably be adding some into here.

Feel free to post here. I will answer all of your questions (guaranteed I know the answer) here.
Except how to get ZBrush. If you don&#39;t have it and srsly CBA to google it or get a link for yourself, PM me.</description>

<p>When you’re learning a new program (especially since you have no experience) it is A LOT more helpful to get a video tutorial.</p>

Look in basics, ZSpheres, and any other if you’re interested.</p>
<p>This will be a ongoing “contest.” It will be open for a very long time. As many entries as you want. Anyone can enter as long as it’s a ZBrush character.</p>
<p>Hell, you could model a small character and import him into ZBrush and then sculpt him. I will probably be adding some into here.</p>
<p>Feel free to post here. I will answer all of your questions (guaranteed I know the answer) here.<br>
Except how to get ZBrush. If you don’t have it and srsly CBA to google it or get a link for yourself, PM me.</p>
