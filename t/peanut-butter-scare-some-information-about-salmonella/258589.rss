    <title>Peanut Butter Scare (Some information about Salmonella)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/peanut-butter-scare-some-information-about-salmonella/258589</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Now is not the time to curse your peanut allergy. Over 125 products have been recalled because of a salmonella outbreak linked to peanuts. More than 400 people have gotten sick and several deaths have been reported.


Experts believe the bad peanuts came from a plant in Georgia that makes peanut butter and peanut paste for bulk distribution — to cafeterias, nursing homes, etc. — and for use in food manufacturing.

And peanuts are in everything, from cakes, cookies and cereal to dog treats. 

As a result, the recall list is wide-ranging and long. Before we go any further, here&#39;s the FDA&#39;s list of recalled products.

Now, a rundown on salmonella-related questions, with links to more information:

How do you contract salmonella poisoning? Usually by consuming a food contaminated with the bacteria. Search for how salmonella gets into peanuts.

What are the symptoms? It&#39;s not pretty. Here&#39;s a summary.

Is it contagious? Short answer, yes. Here&#39;s how you catch it. To help prevent it: Do this, people.

How&#39;s it treated? It generally goes away on its own after a rough several days. However, the infection can be severe and require hospitalization. Read more.

Have any doubts? Call your doctor.

Finally, should you toss the peanut butter? Read more about that on MSNBC.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
