    <description>Recently, deathschaos9 helped me fix the 100 errors i was having, but now, when you create a new person, the stats are at 0, and my armor that i set is gone.
I could upload then files which he changed, if anyone wants me to.

EDIT: I have found that when you login, it flashes my armor that i had set and then it shows the die message before the welcome message everytime.</description>
