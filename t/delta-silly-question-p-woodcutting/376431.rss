    <title>[Delta] Silly question :p woodcutting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-silly-question-p-woodcutting/376431</link>
    <description>If my player has the woodcutting hatchet in his bag and it clicks a tree it will do the animation but with its hand? I have put the correct animations in though... Is there a way I can make it look like he is chopping with his hatchet rather than his fist?

Also because I cba to spam and create another thread:

I can log into my server once but once I have disconnected I can no longer login it just spams:

[code=java]
Connection from 127.0.0.1:53727
[client-1-Jason]: Loading Process Completed  [Has powers, lag: 1 ms]
Game saved for player Jason
ClientHandler: Client Jason disconnected (127.0.0.1)
Connection from 127.0.0.1:53728
[client-1-Jason]: Loading Process Completed  [Has powers, lag: 1 ms]
[/code]
and then when I restart the server and login I am at falador park xD</description>
