People who need welfare aren’t working “fukken” hard enough.</p>
<p>Ford the record I supprot unemployment checks, but not for people who have been out of a job for over a year, and they should have to show proof that they have been looking for a job, not just sitting and waiting until the year is up.</p>
<p>Also, I welfare programs are fine when the government isn’t running them or paying them, like non-profit organizations, this way I can write it off on my taxes, instead of getting taxed.</p>

<p>But anyhow, I hate these parties, yet I love them too. They tend to wake up the older parties, which have been in control for too long and should be in the opposition for a while. But I dislike these parties because they make our countries like Vietnam was for the US in the Cold War: An extension for the Jews to piss on Muslims. I don’t know about the funding of the SD, but the Dutch party which is almost the same is mainly funded by Zionists.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:2, topic:361222”]I’m disgusted by the fact that Sharia law is being enforced by muslims in Sweden, rather than respecting Sweden’s laws.<br>
Personally I’d see to it that any practitioners of sharia law in Australia were deported, if I could. Sweden doesn’t need that shit either.[/quote]It isn’t really being enforced, but in the slum cops can’t do shit at the moment. This is why SD got elected into the government. It doesn’t really bother me much at all, what bothers me is that the right-wing won, and in the coming 4 years they will turn our welfare into void. Say hello to the new Sweden, a clone of usa!</p>
