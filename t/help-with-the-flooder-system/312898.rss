              <p>Thats not a ip ban its just someone has either tryed to log in with a diffrent pass too many times which caused flooding, or someone has syiâ€™d your server &amp; it has rejected/banned the host, For players who get this will just need to restart there client. &amp; then they can log back on again.</p>
