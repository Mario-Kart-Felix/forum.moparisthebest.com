    <title>Cannot make webclient!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cannot-make-webclient/398119</link>
    <description>Before you flame me. I have Tried like 30 different tutorials to make webclients. Ranging from non-renamed/refactored tuts to custom client tuts. NONE work. I have tried the web sited that make them for you and they dont work either. If someone could please please help me set up my webclient for my delta 317 I&#39;d appreciate it so very much. I&#39;ve been trying to get a web client working for a couple months now and all the tutorials come up as duds.</description>
