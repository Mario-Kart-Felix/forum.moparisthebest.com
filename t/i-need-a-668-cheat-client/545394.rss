              <p>When someone builds a cheat client it is typically not for others. They use it until they are bored or banned then release them. Not to mention the gratification from being able to outsmart others is quite nice too <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Mikescape hates me lol. (I ended up with 99 prayer and unlimited money within a week ._.)<br>
They didnt appreciate how a noob passed up the players (who have played for years) in a week lol. Not to mention i left a lovely message on their highscores for their head mod <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>They do have really capable coders on the server and i give them props for that. I don’t know what language was used for it but it is really lag free and quite advanced for an RSPS. (if you look in their client, they have a special “command” that was blocked thanks to me lol.</p>
<p>OP: If you want a client, build one or look until one is released. If you don’t know how, that sucks.</p>
