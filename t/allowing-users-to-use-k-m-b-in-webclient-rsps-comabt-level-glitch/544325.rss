    <description>Hello guys,

I&#39;ve been looking for a way so players can withdraw fro puch/ sell,buy,trade using k/m/b via webclient. I couldnt find any tut, anybody could help me to do that?

Another problem I have is, when I level up (combat level) it doesnt refresh, which means I stay at my old level, I need to relog so I could see my new level. Anybody knows a fix for that? :/


I am also having this
[QUOTE]Error: T2 - 134,126,126 - 6,3040,3440 - 24,0,0,0,0,1,[/QUOTE]
I fixed the T1, but couldnt fix the T2

Thanks a lot!</description>
