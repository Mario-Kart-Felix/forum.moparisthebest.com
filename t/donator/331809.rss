    <title>Donator</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/donator/331809</link>
    <description>Hi everyone,
got little problem,
I&#39;ve downloaded an source with already in donator.
so looked for anycommand to make some 1 donator in client,
searched for donar, givedonar, givedonator, givedonater, donater, donated,
tried all like that in server also looked for any other give command or something with donate in it.

but there isnt 1.
how i know there is donator, the old owner left his acc, so i changed pass, and when i log in its say welcome_DONATOR_TY something like that, and he can trade donatorshop,

so i thought no problem i just change in character donator 1 like he got, didnt work-.-
so i thought second option just copy all except name and pass did, even compiled while it shouldnt have to, stil i wasnt donator. every tiem i logged out and looked in my character it was gone to 0 -.-

anyone know whats wrong? cause if he can be donator why not me?</description>

              <p>In the Config folder, you should see something like donators.txt open that, and put your name in on the next line. for example.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Bill
Joey
Killall
PKER</code></pre>
<p>would all be donators.</p>
