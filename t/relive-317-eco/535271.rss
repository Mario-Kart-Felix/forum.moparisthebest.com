    <description>Relive recreates memories of 2006, A great economy, a great player base, and most important, Great staff.
This server is one of the best i have played, because it takes me back to old rsps, 
the good 317&#39;s that actually had a good economy.
You have to earn your items, You start out with enough to get you through, but after that, you&#39;re on your own!
One of the best economy&#39;s on a 317 right now, of course, it is not that hard to get items.
Hope to see you there?  :cool:
