    <title>SIMPLE? - Work around client/source conflict?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simple-work-around-client-source-conflict/549966</link>
    <description>Hi Moparscape,
What exactly would I need to delete from a custom made source &quot;custom content *preferably the player model* &quot; if I wanted it to run on a non custom client?
The server works fine just the player can&#39;t be seen upon logging in?</description>
