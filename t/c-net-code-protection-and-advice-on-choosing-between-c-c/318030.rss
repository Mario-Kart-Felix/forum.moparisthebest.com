    <title>C#/.NET - code protection? And advice on choosing between C++/C#</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/c-net-code-protection-and-advice-on-choosing-between-c-c/318030</link>
    <description>I would like to know how well can .NET code be protected from reverse engineering. There are various tools around. I&#39;m new to this whole topic on .NET code protection. I found out that a tool called .NET Reactor actually prevents Dis# and .NET Reflector from being used to get the source code.

So I would actually like to know how efficient are the tools to protect .NET code and how efficient are the tools to reverse engineer it.

I would also like some advice on choosing between C++ and C#. I would go with C# if I get a positive reply here(that there are tools that make it impossible to get the source code) since I wouldn&#39;t be writing low-level applications. Otherwize I&#39;ll go the hard way and learn C++.

Thanks.</description>
