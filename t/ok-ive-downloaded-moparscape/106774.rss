              <p>[left]    ok, you downloaded there client? Well if that is what you downloaded it isn’t “the actual game” it is just a client to login to your game or someone elses, well first of all you want to get a source such as “pimpscape, cheezescape, or any other starter sources” Then once you download a source you compile it, but make sure you have the updated version of java  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/archive/j2se/6/index.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/products/archive/j2se/6/index.html</a> click on that link if you don’t have the updated java. Then after you compile, with no errors then click run.bat, then open up your moparscape client or use their web client then type in a username and pass word and click login.And to have others join  you have to get your ip address which you can find at <a href="http://www.ipchicken.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.ipchicken.com</a> then tell who ever you want to join to type in your ip address in the “server ip:” spot in moparscape’s client and then they should be able to login to your server. Any more help just pm me on this forums or post.[/left]</p>
