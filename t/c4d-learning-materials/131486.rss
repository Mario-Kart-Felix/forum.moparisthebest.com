It seems like you guys don&#39;t do anything but composition these days to call it a work.
Some of you just download textures, and slap them on downloaded objects, and place them all in a room you made.

Well tutorial is aimed to better you. Whether you just started, or are confused by the material system.

If you didn&#39;t know, to make a new material, double click in the blank spot on the material browser.

Then double click on the material. Now we&#39;ve got the settings.

[img]http://www2.asro.kuleuven.ac.be/asro/English/HOME/SBs/tutorial/tips/ac2c4d/c4d8_skymaterial.jpg[/img]
(Ignore the settings, this is just to show that you&#39;re in the right place)

Now you&#39;ve got lots of channels. I&#39;m going to explain what each one is and dow here.
To activate a channel, you check the box next to it. Simple. And to change the parameters, you click the name of the channel, and you should get the options.

But each channels options are usually the same.

[b]Color [/b] 
It&#39;s always good to have this unless you&#39;re making something like a GI Sky or something more complex.
The top part lets you choose the color, and the % of the color affecting the object. I&#39;ll get into the % later.

You can also use one of C4D&#39;s channels as a color, say if you were making a checkerboard. Or import your own image. Just click that arrow to get the drop down list, or click the &quot;...&quot; to import.

[b]Diffusion[/b]
Does what it says, diffuses light, kinda. I barely ever use this. But if you want to try it out, it&#39;s basically the same as the color tab in terms of how-to.

[b]Luminance[/b]
This will make your object self-luminous. If you don&#39;t know what that means, it will glow. It will make your object a lot brighter depending on your settings. If you have GI enabled, the object will become a light itself, depending on how bright you have it. The top part changes the color that is emitted by the light. An image wouldn&#39;t necesarrily emit that image however. I think those are calculated as the brightness. So if you imported a checkerboard, it would only be luminous where the white parts are. The black would be normal.

[b]Transparency[/b]
Makes your objects transparent. The top part would change the color of the transparency. Then how transparent it is. The IOR. Changes how much it refracts. Fresnel makes it reflect more around the edges of the objects. And again. I think the images would do the same here, transparent where white, normal where black. Dispersion is like blurry refractions. Increases render time for an okay effect.

[b]Reflection[/b]
Reflects things. Theres the color of the reflection. How reflective it is. Images do the same here. Dispersion is like blurry reflections. It just increases render times by a lot though.

[b]Environment[/b]
I never played around much with this one either. But if I remember correctly, this basically surrounds the object. If you put an HDRI here, the object would be lit correctly and reflect the HDRI. Something like that.

[b]Fog[/b]
Turns your objects into fog kinda. Never really had a use for this either.

[b]Bump[/b]
Adds a bump map. You can control how high or low the bump bumps. And load an effect or image.

[b]Normal[/b]
Normal maps instead of bump maps. Just import the image and set the settings.

[b]Alpha[/b]
Like a mask. It will hide part of your object. Import your alpha here lol

[b]Specular[/b]
How light reflects on the object. Pretty self explanatory. The color is the color of the reflection. Width is how wide it will go. Height is how bright.

[b]Specular Color[/b]
I use this to mark which parts are affected by the specular. I import a map with white as the brighter areas and black as the darker. This is good if you have say, bricks with water on them. Bricks with low spec, and water with high.

[b]Glow[/b]
For Advanced Render, this makes objects glow. It puts like, an aura around them.

[b]Displacement[/b]
Adds geometry without it being there basically. Can be used to make low-poly objects extremely-high-poly objects if used correctly. Load the texture and set the params.

[i]NOTE[/i]: Keep color/reflection balanced for best results. IE: 30%/60%, 50%/50%, 90%/10%
[i]NOTE2[/i]: If you click on the effect that you inputted for a channel, you can get that effects options.
[i]NOTE3[/i]: If you import an image or effect, the brightness you set for the channel and the mix amount will multiply. Play around with the brightness and mix amount to get the desired effect.

[i][b]Some good material settings[/b][/i]:

[b]Water[/b]
Color: slightly blue tint.
Transparencty: IOR=1.333, around 95% transparency, another slight blue tint.
Reflection: Balance it with color, and have a lot of it.
Specular: Low width, high height.
Bump: Make a noise channel, and not a lot of noise, like 300% Global Scale I think. Then turn the bump low to like 4.

[b]Chrome[/b]
Color: 10%
Reflection: 90%
Specular: Medium-Low Width, High Height.

[b]Tiles[/b]
Color: Add a tile channel with your settings.
Reflection: Add the same channel here, just with Greyish tiles and black grout.
Specular: Low width, high height.
Bump: Same tile channel, white tiles, black grout.

[b]Glass[/b]
Color: Color of glass.
Transparency: IOR=1.5, Fresnel, 90+% transparency.
Reflection: Balance with color, and have lots.
Specular: Low width, high height.</description>

You would turn all channels off but Luminance, put it there, and put that on a Sky object.</p>
