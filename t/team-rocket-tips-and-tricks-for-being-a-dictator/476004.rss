    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;All Players must abide by the rules stated below:


#1 - No Player, no matter Rank, Community standing, or position may use Foul Language in any form. 

#2 - The only spoken Language must be English.

#3 - No harrassment of any form is tolerated.

#4 - All Clans, Guilds, Organizations, and Groups MUST be public. Secret Clans, Guilds, etc. are not allowed.

#5 - You may only access Cynosure from the Official Public Client. 

#6 - You must conform to and maintain the Terms of Service agreement, and all clauses/statements therein. Failure to do so will result in Account Suspension.

#7 - Third-Party programs, applications, edited clients, injections, sniffing, and editing are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. Players who dabble in such things will be terminated; regardless of if it is conducted towards Cynosure or not.

#8 - Scamming another Player in any form is unacceptable. Your words must be your bond and solid.

#9 - Impersonating a Player Moderator, Administrator, Forum Moderator, or Gamemaster is against the rules. Violation of this rule will result in an immediate suspension of all Accounts.

#10 - You MUST report any Glitches, Bugs, Errors, Exploits, Duplications, un-fair Gameplay Mechanics, and any fault found immediately to the Community as a whole. This Rule includes Unbalanced Game Content.

#11 - Advertising in any form is prohibited. Violation of this Rule will result in an immediate Mute which sticks to your Internet Protocol I.D.

#12 - Disrespecting another Player is frowned upon - regardless of their Rank, Position, or Community standing.

#13 - Any type or form of Gameplay Manipulation is forbidden.

#14 - The only place for Player-to-Player Trade is the Concourse. It is impossible to Trade outside of this area. Anyone caught doing so will have their Accounts erased.

#15 - Anyone caught with or releasing Staff-privy information will be Jailed.

#16 - Rewards (cosmetic and hardly practical) are offered to any Player who can Duplicate an Item. These exploits MUST be reported immediately, or they forfeit any possible Rewards.

#17 - All Tickets made by Players must be genuine, truthful, and logical. If your Ticket created does not match the criterion listed, it is considered to be Gameplay Manipulation.

#18 - Account Sharing, Multi-Logging, and House Accounts are frowned upon.

#19 - Luring a Player to their death, via Player Killing or Player V.S. Monster is frowned upon.

#20 - Phishing, Account Hacking, Social Engineering with malevolent intent, and attempts to gain access to an Account which is not yours will result in permanent termination.&lt;/blockquote&gt;



I understand that most Servers already follow a similar set of rules. Let us discuss punishments for violations of these rules however. I have a theory, in which breaking certain rules does not result in a punishment which directly affects game-play, but rather adds the Player&#39;s name to a Universal Blacklist. Any Player at any time can access said Blacklist, to check for things such as: Untrustworthy Players, Scam Artists, Exploiters, &#39;Hackers&#39;, etc. As you can see, there are already some ideas for punishment listed in the Rules, which I would like to be debated.



Let us debate all of these Rules and befitting punishments.</description>

<p>Clawz Fury was right though. Balance is VERY important for EVERY video game; Private Server or not. With unbalanced content, your Players will not be happy, and will cry out for Balance.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if I have broken these Rules in the past or not. I’ve broken every single one of these Rules in my life, AND I’ve broken every single Rule in RuneScape. I was actually a “big-time” scammer in my RuneScape experience, if you can believe that. I agree that it was indeed VERY fun to do so, but that doesn’t mean it should be acceptable in our R.S.P.S. Most scam-artists are good at blending in, because they’re versed in deception and lying to others. Most scams require some skill and knowledge in Social Engineering. You can’t tell me that people don’t form Clans/Groups solely to exploit a game, because I know this from first-hand experience to be untrue. You’re just commenting on the Rules based upon your own personal feelings, but that’s O.K. because It’s an open discussion. I’d love some <span class="bbcode-b">constructive</span> comments though! Like how we could improve upon these; instead of just commenting on them.</p>

<p>These are all very unrealistic and I wouldn’t stand for a server that had this many bad rules. I break so many of them constantly, and what the love is with rule <span class="hashtag">#4</span>? That’s like saying your kids can’t have a secret club where they discuss how mean adults are - they have to tell everyone. Some people deserve to be disrespected, and what these rules tell me is it’s not okay. Getting hacked is the own user’s fault for not having a secure enough password or being careless with what they download and run (and besides, shouldn’t this server offer a recovery system?) Same thing with scams. It sounds like whoever wrote these rules was just writing rules so they’d have a big wall to show off to newcomers so they wouldn’t join.</p>

<p>“Frowned upon” What is this SUPPOSED to mean? If you do it, you’ll get a dirty look from players? You’ll get banned? Not only are these rules bad, but they’re unclear as to what may happen if you break them.</p>
<p>This whole list just brings the bad out of me and makes me hope his or her server gets zero players. Almost none of these rules are necessary to run a very successful private server. Look at Davidi2’s - there isn’t a set of rules anywhere. All that exists is a single post that prohibits botting and the server is growing rapidly and maintaining a good player base. 20 rules is absolutely ridiculous.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback. We need more people criticizing like this, instead of just lavishing praise.</p>
<p>I should have clarified what the “frowned upon” means. These are the Rules which when broken would apply to the Universal Blacklist - instead of a ‘punishment’. I agree that these Rules set the expectations bar VERY high, and yes they’re unrealistic, but they’re still very possible to enforce and maintain. To be honest and blunt, I really could care less what other Servers do as far as Rules go. With a set of Rules like these, the Server would be very strict, and it will indeed turn some potential Players away. It can be argued that these Players are the ones that the Community doesn’t need in the first place however (not directed towards you in any way). Most Players who dabble in R.S.P.S. have already played RuneScape at one point, and are already familiar with what is expected of them. This is probably one of the reasons as to why Davidi2 doesn’t need to post a set of Rules.</p>

<p>I don’t design things for the enjoyment of others though, I do it for <span class="bbcode-b">my</span> enjoyment. I just think up and create what I’d enjoy, and I guess the majority seems to like what I like.</p>

              <p>That is partially true, however, there are a select few that you can have ‘faith’ in. I do believe they are referred to as the back-seat mods. You also, if you have your server running long enough, have the veterans you can <span class="bbcode-b">usually</span> count on.</p>
<p>I have said it once and will say it again, if you can’t trust your players (or at least most of them) there is no need in running a server for <span class="bbcode-b">their</span> enjoyment.</p>
<p>Edit: I understand what you’re saying, it’s impossible, or nearly impossible, to get to know and trust someone over the Internet.</p>

<p>This will probably ignite a shitstorm, but take it from me. You can never fully trust any Player.</p>

<p>[Quote]As for the Foul Language, I don’t want people swearing on my Server. It’s really as simple as that. A lot of children play RuneScape and R.S.P.S. I can list 100 other reasons as to why this should be a solid and enforced rule.</p>

<p>Can’t argue with that.</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Secret Clans? What’s wrong with that, Team_Rocket??? A team of ‘hackers’ can ruin a R.S.P.S. Without supervision and being public, they can dedicate their Clan/Guild/whatever to solely finding exploits, glitches, dupes, etc. It’s also possible for them to be a private Luring Clan, and remain private by intimidating anyone who stands against them</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>True, but can’t one lie and say they’re creating a clan for skilling and actually be teaching other players about exploits?</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>English must be the only spoken language, due to the lack of bi-lingual speakers and Staffers (let us not forget rare ‘tri-speakers’). The Players could be saying anything from disrespecting a Staff Member, to scamming - to swearing in another language. </p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So they will be punished if they speak their native language? It just doesn’t seem fair.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I never said non-English speakers would be punished for communicating in their Native Tongue. This is one of the reasons I needed to post this here. What seems fair to you? Besides letting everyone speak any language.</p>
<p>Also, yes, they can lie and do as you say. It will be very hard for them to do so since all Clans must be Public though. Think of this idea as a sort of “Padlock Concept”. A Padlock is a joke when it comes to security. It’s designed to keep ‘good’ people out and away; not ‘bad’ people, because they will gain entry regardless.</p>
