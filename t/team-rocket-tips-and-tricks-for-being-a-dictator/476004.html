<p><span class="hashtag">#7</span> - Third-Party programs, applications, edited clients, injections, sniffing, and editing are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. Players who dabble in such things will be terminated; regardless of if it is conducted towards Cynosure or not.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#8</span> - Scamming another Player in any form is unacceptable. Your words must be your bond and solid.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#9</span> - Impersonating a Player Moderator, Administrator, Forum Moderator, or Gamemaster is against the rules. Violation of this rule will result in an immediate suspension of all Accounts.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#10</span> - You MUST report any Glitches, Bugs, Errors, Exploits, Duplications, un-fair Gameplay Mechanics, and any fault found immediately to the Community as a whole. This Rule includes Unbalanced Game Content.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#11</span> - Advertising in any form is prohibited. Violation of this Rule will result in an immediate Mute which sticks to your Internet Protocol I.D.</p>

<p><span class="hashtag">#17</span> - All Tickets made by Players must be genuine, truthful, and logical. If your Ticket created does not match the criterion listed, it is considered to be Gameplay Manipulation.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#18</span> - Account Sharing, Multi-Logging, and House Accounts are frowned upon.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#19</span> - Luring a Player to their death, via Player Killing or Player V.S. Monster is frowned upon.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#20</span> - Phishing, Account Hacking, Social Engineering with malevolent intent, and attempts to gain access to an Account which is not yours will result in permanent termination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand that most Servers already follow a similar set of rules. Let us discuss punishments for violations of these rules however. I have a theory, in which breaking certain rules does not result in a punishment which directly affects game-play, but rather adds the Player’s name to a Universal Blacklist. Any Player at any time can access said Blacklist, to check for things such as: Untrustworthy Players, Scam Artists, Exploiters, ‘Hackers’, etc. As you can see, there are already some ideas for punishment listed in the Rules, which I would like to be debated.</p>
<p>Let us debate all of these Rules and befitting punishments.</p>

        <p>First thing’s first; Why do you always add your name in your title(s)?</p>
<p>Now on to your rules;</p>

<li>Let’s get real, this is the internet and almost everybody will use foul language here and there, rather it be offensive or humorous, and to punish them for it is somewhat hypocritical because you most likely use inappropriate language as well.</li>
<li>I don’t even see a point in this rule. What gives you (or the owner) the right to tell a player they can’t speak their native language? If there are two or more players that speak the same language, I see no harm in them conversing with one another.</li>
<li>Why? The players should have a right to form a clan/guild in secrecy if they wish. For all you know, it could be temporary.</li>
<li>If a player is stupid enough to get scammed they deserve it. Learning from your mistakes isn’t necessarily a bad thing. (I could possibly come up with an alternative to this rule)</li>
<li>A player being awarded for reporting a dupe? Shouldn’t they do this for the good of the server?</li>
</ol>
<p>Every other rule I agree with. I will edit (or comment again) this post once I get more time to think of the proper punishments for rule-breakers.</p>

<p>Agreed, also:</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>Why multi-logging? I get that players can farm and what not but anyone with a decent amount of programming experience can make it so two players from the same ip cannot trade, fight, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>As for your blacklist idea, that is an extremely effective tool to prevent players from doing bad things. Who wants to be known as the server scammer?</p>

<ol>
<li>When you’re looking from a professional point of view, swearing has tendencies to show lack of intelligence. You don’t go to a corporation and find the workers or executives cursing at each other - do you?</li>
<li>When the server is based and written in English, we’d expect the players to be speaking that too. How can we help people if we have no idea what they’re saying? Also, saying “Just have translators” well, if we’re based in a English-speaking country and have no option other than English, we’re assuming our community speaks it.</li>
<li>I really don’t have input on secret guilds, I kind of believe they should exist actually.</li>
<li>Scamming is not only a reflection on the player doing it, but the community as a whole. It hurts everyone, not just the single player being affected.</li>
<li>No one will ever do it just because they feel good about it, yeah I feel good if I donate to charity but I rather buy myself a new phone… Rewards entice people to do stuff, they don’t say “You’ll feel good if you help us capture the serial rapist!” No, they offer cash.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just my input.</p>

        <p>Using inappropriate language doesn’t show lack of intelligence. If that’s the case, everyone on this forum is a unintelligent piece of shit. (That’s going a little too far, I know) As for the co-workers cussing at each other; when you curse, you don’t necessarily aim it at anyone. It’s just part of today’s speech.</p>
<p>If a player can speak both English and Spanish and another player does as well, there is no harm in them using their native language whilst conversing with one another, in this case Spanish.</p>
<p>As for the scamming; I partially agree with you.</p>
<p>I know a player should do it for the good of the server; but we’re in reality.</p>

<p>Anyone with a decent amount of programming experience and networking knowledge can also get around this.</p>
<p>As for the Foul Language, I don’t want people swearing on my Server. It’s really as simple as that. A lot of children play RuneScape and R.S.P.S. I can list 100 other reasons as to why this should be a solid and enforced rule.</p>
<p>English must be the only spoken language, due to the lack of bi-lingual speakers and Staffers (let us not forget rare ‘tri-speakers’). The Players could be saying anything from disrespecting a Staff Member, to scamming - to swearing in another language.</p>
<p>Why would Players be rewarded for finding an Item Duplication? Any Player who wishes to have an unfair advantage over competition would exploit an Item Duplication glitch without hesitation. It is the Developer/Programmer’s fault that the exploit is even possible. A Player should NOT be punished for this, but should be rewarded for finding and reporting such things. This is one reason why so many Item Duplication exploits go un-checked and un-patched in a R.S.P.S. The Players know that there will probably be consequences in the first place, and why would they want to ruin a good thing for themselves?</p>
<p>Secret Clans? What’s wrong with that, Team_Rocket??? A team of ‘hackers’ can ruin a R.S.P.S. Without supervision and being public, they can dedicate their Clan/Guild/whatever to solely finding exploits, glitches, dupes, etc. It’s also possible for them to be a private Luring Clan, and remain private by intimidating anyone who stands against them.</p>
<p>Keep the questions coming guys. I’m more than willing to debate and explain all of these Rules.</p>

<p>I never said non-English speakers would be punished for communicating in their Native Tongue. This is one of the reasons I needed to post this here. What seems fair to you? Besides letting everyone speak any language.</p>
<p>Also, yes, they can lie and do as you say. It will be very hard for them to do so since all Clans must be Public though. Think of this idea as a sort of “Padlock Concept”. A Padlock is a joke when it comes to security. It’s designed to keep ‘good’ people out and away; not ‘bad’ people, because they will gain entry regardless.</p>

<p>These are all very unrealistic and I wouldn’t stand for a server that had this many bad rules. I break so many of them constantly, and what the fuck is with rule <span class="hashtag">#4</span>? That’s like saying your kids can’t have a secret club where they discuss how mean adults are - they have to tell everyone. Some people deserve to be disrespected, and what these rules tell me is it’s not okay. Getting hacked is the own user’s fault for not having a secure enough password or being careless with what they download and run (and besides, shouldn’t this server offer a recovery system?) Same thing with scams. It sounds like whoever wrote these rules was just writing rules so they’d have a big wall to show off to newcomers so they wouldn’t join.</p>
<blockquote>#12 - Disrespecting another Player is frowned upon - regardless of their Rank, Position, or Community standing.
#18 - Account Sharing, Multi-Logging, and House Accounts are frowned upon.
#19 - Luring a Player to their death, via Player Killing or Player V.S. Monster is frowned upon.</blockquote>
<p>“Frowned upon” What is this SUPPOSED to mean? If you do it, you’ll get a dirty look from players? You’ll get banned? Not only are these rules bad, but they’re unclear as to what may happen if you break them.</p>
<p>This whole list just brings the bad out of me and makes me hope his or her server gets zero players. Almost none of these rules are necessary to run a very successful private server. Look at Davidi2’s - there isn’t a set of rules anywhere. All that exists is a single post that prohibits botting and the server is growing rapidly and maintaining a good player base. 20 rules is absolutely ridiculous.</p>

<p>These are all very unrealistic and I wouldn’t stand for a server that had this many bad rules. I break so many of them constantly, and what the love is with rule <span class="hashtag">#4</span>? That’s like saying your kids can’t have a secret club where they discuss how mean adults are - they have to tell everyone. Some people deserve to be disrespected, and what these rules tell me is it’s not okay. Getting hacked is the own user’s fault for not having a secure enough password or being careless with what they download and run (and besides, shouldn’t this server offer a recovery system?) Same thing with scams. It sounds like whoever wrote these rules was just writing rules so they’d have a big wall to show off to newcomers so they wouldn’t join.</p>

<p>“Frowned upon” What is this SUPPOSED to mean? If you do it, you’ll get a dirty look from players? You’ll get banned? Not only are these rules bad, but they’re unclear as to what may happen if you break them.</p>
<p>This whole list just brings the bad out of me and makes me hope his or her server gets zero players. Almost none of these rules are necessary to run a very successful private server. Look at Davidi2’s - there isn’t a set of rules anywhere. All that exists is a single post that prohibits botting and the server is growing rapidly and maintaining a good player base. 20 rules is absolutely ridiculous.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback. We need more people criticizing like this, instead of just lavishing praise.</p>
<p>I should have clarified what the “frowned upon” means. These are the Rules which when broken would apply to the Universal Blacklist - instead of a ‘punishment’. I agree that these Rules set the expectations bar VERY high, and yes they’re unrealistic, but they’re still very possible to enforce and maintain. To be honest and blunt, I really could care less what other Servers do as far as Rules go. With a set of Rules like these, the Server would be very strict, and it will indeed turn some potential Players away. It can be argued that these Players are the ones that the Community doesn’t need in the first place however (not directed towards you in any way). Most Players who dabble in R.S.P.S. have already played RuneScape at one point, and are already familiar with what is expected of them. This is probably one of the reasons as to why Davidi2 doesn’t need to post a set of Rules.</p>

        <p>If I ran a server, I’d have one rule, and that would be to use common sense. This would include botting, sharing exploits, etc.</p>
<p>Having too many rules could be a problem, not only would it cause players to quit, but it would also increase the number of potential rule-breakers.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if I have broken these Rules in the past or not. I’ve broken every single one of these Rules in my life, AND I’ve broken every single Rule in RuneScape. I was actually a “big-time” scammer in my RuneScape experience, if you can believe that. I agree that it was indeed VERY fun to do so, but that doesn’t mean it should be acceptable in our R.S.P.S. Most scam-artists are good at blending in, because they’re versed in deception and lying to others. Most scams require some skill and knowledge in Social Engineering. You can’t tell me that people don’t form Clans/Groups solely to exploit a game, because I know this from first-hand experience to be untrue. You’re just commenting on the Rules based upon your own personal feelings, but that’s O.K. because It’s an open discussion. I’d love some <span class="bbcode-b">constructive</span> comments though! Like how we could improve upon these; instead of just commenting on them.</p>
