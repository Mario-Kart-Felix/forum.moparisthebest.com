    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Jeremy Clarkson has caused another controversy after today criticising people who kill themselves on train lines.
The notorious presenter said that anyone who committed suicide in this way was &#39;very selfish&#39; for traumatising train drivers and inconveniencing commuters.

Although he puts it very blunt, he actually has a point this time. I can understand that people can be at wits end and commit suicide, but I can&#39;t understand they jump in front of trains. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s an inconvenience for commuters, but it has a great effect on everyone involved in cleaning up the remains, and the family of the person who has killed himself. I don&#39;t doubt that a train driver will become suicidal himself when he witnesses this.

Of course Clarkson&#39;s solutions is one of a barbarian, and is despicable. But what do you guys think about suicide by train? Despicable too?</description>

<p>His latest outburst…</p>

<p>Outburst… OUTBURST!? I’ve never really read the daily mail but if they print shit like this they must be ass holes.</p>
<p>I’ve written out huge paragraphs in reply to this but each one isn’t sounding how I want it to sound…</p>
<p>The only way it could possibly not be selfish is if somebody had the thought in their mind that everyone else would be better off if they were dead. Now if they have this on their mind obviously the last thing they want to do is inconvenience more people by throwing themselves in front of a train. Jeremy is right here they are selfish. I was selfish when I tried it.</p>

              <p>It is selfish but to them it’s probably a better way to end their lives. Would you rather get hit by a train and die a death with little thought/suffering or jump in the River Thames and suffocate to death/ take in polluted water?</p>
<p>I do agree a lethal dose would be better than both of them but that’s probably not an option for everyone. The only thing I fear out of this Clarkson situation is if Top gear fire him due to unpopularity or some other stupid reason.</p>

              <p>Okay, his comment of shooting strikers is questionable even though it doesn’t take an Einstein to work out that he said it figuratively. This though is a completely different: suicide on it’s own is selfish, regardless of the persons situation. Suicide by jumping in front of a train is even more selfish and rather stupid. I don’t condemn suicide at all but if one were to commit, it should be done peacefully (like a lethal dose of something).</p>
