    <title>Mopar Weekly (#2)</title>

    <description>[size=24pt]News (for the week 08/06/2015)[/size]

[size=14pt][url=https://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/]RS Wiki[/url] [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,670758.0.html]Cleanup[/url][/size]
We have recently decided to update the official RS wiki by adding [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=350406]Pure_[/url] and [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=449007]sini[/url] as admins. Our hope is that sini can contribute his invaluable knowledge in the form of concise articles.
This has also led to a massive purge of spam by Pure_ (somewhere around 1,500 posts were deleted and many accounts blocked permanently). While we will keep up this work we hope that the higher-level management can help us out by implementing spam filters soon!

[size=14pt][url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,670791.0.html]Groovy Scripting for Beginners[/url] (by [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=350406]Pure_[/url])[/size]
As a part of a new scheme to encourage activity in the tutorial board, Pure_ has taken it upon himself to post and explain some general ideas which can be implemented into any server regardless of revision or language.
This week he decided upon a simple plugin system, with the point of such threads being to encourage discussion about good practices and as such improvements upon the original post.

[size=18pt]Game Development[/size]

[size=14pt][url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,669617.0.html]Codename::World[/url] (by [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=67436]Lin[/url])[/size]
Lin had began his project a couple of months ago to accomplish his dream, of building a sandbox environment where the player is not constrained by the programming.
In recent updates his project has really taken off, prompting this highlight of his amazing project! We are certain of his individual ability as well as his amazing idea and wish him the best, make sure you give him some feedback and keep up with the development!

[size=18pt]General Discussion[/size]

[size=14pt][url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,670678.0.html]How fast can you type?[/url] (by [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=697625]WarTusk-RSPS[/url])[/size]
This thread has really taken off recently with several members chiming in to compete with each other&#39;s typing speeds :P Make sure you try your hand at it and post the results!

[size=18pt]Senior Member Feature - [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=19676]Archer[/url][/size]
This is the first in hopefully many senior member features, a series which was masterminded by the old front-page project (now deceased, rip). This week we have managed to get a hold of [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=19676]Archer[/url].

[b]A little about yourself?[/b]
I was a graphics designer and posted my work on the MoparScape forums for a long period time. This line of work included modelling and other general art. You can still find my doodles here and there :)

[b]How did you find the community?[/b]
I joined due to the FreeScape server back in 2006.

[b]What are you known for?[/b]
I was a moderator for a while on the forums. My graphics posts also attracted a lot of attention and you can always find me on IRC!

[b]What makes you stay here?[/b]
Once you&#39;re in, you can&#39;t leave.

[b]Advice to newcomers trying to become better programmers/artists/etc?[/b]
Make sure you aren&#39;t arrogant, it will get you nowhere. Use google before asking anything, it was really helpful for me in picking up the basics and finding solutions to a lot of problems. Last but not least try to use some level of formal english on the forums, we can&#39;t help you if we can&#39;t understand you :p

[b]What do you do nowadays?[/b]
I am in University seeking an AA and AS degree in video game development. You can still catch me on IRC talking about my hobbies, which include being a Tae Kwan Doe black-belt and collecting firearms.

[b]Inspiration![/b]
If you stick around, follow the rules and contribute to the community you will gain respect from the veteran members and learn valuable skills that will aid you in your future, on and off the forums.</description>

We have recently decided to update the official RS wiki by adding <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=350406" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Pure_</a> and <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=449007" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">sini</a> as admins. Our hope is that sini can contribute his invaluable knowledge in the form of concise articles.<br>
This has also led to a massive purge of spam by Pure_ (somewhere around 1,500 posts were deleted and many accounts blocked permanently). While we will keep up this work we hope that the higher-level management can help us out by implementing spam filters soon!</p>

As a part of a new scheme to encourage activity in the tutorial board, Pure_ has taken it upon himself to post and explain some general ideas which can be implemented into any server regardless of revision or language.<br>
This week he decided upon a simple plugin system, with the point of such threads being to encourage discussion about good practices and as such improvements upon the original post.</p>

Lin had began his project a couple of months ago to accomplish his dream, of building a sandbox environment where the player is not constrained by the programming.<br>
In recent updates his project has really taken off, prompting this highlight of his amazing project! We are certain of his individual ability as well as his amazing idea and wish him the best, make sure you give him some feedback and keep up with the development!</p>

This thread has really taken off recently with several members chiming in to compete with each other’s typing speeds <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Make sure you try your hand at it and post the results!</p>

<p>[size=18pt]Senior Member Feature - <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=19676" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Archer</a>[/size]<br>
This is the first in hopefully many senior member features, a series which was masterminded by the old front-page project (now deceased, rip). This week we have managed to get a hold of <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=19676" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Archer</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">A little about yourself?</span><br>
I was a graphics designer and posted my work on the MoparScape forums for a long period time. This line of work included modelling and other general art. You can still find my doodles here and there <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How did you find the community?</span><br>
I joined due to the FreeScape server back in 2006.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What are you known for?</span><br>
I was a moderator for a while on the forums. My graphics posts also attracted a lot of attention and you can always find me on IRC!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What makes you stay here?</span><br>
Once you’re in, you can’t leave.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Advice to newcomers trying to become better programmers/artists/etc?</span><br>
Make sure you aren’t arrogant, it will get you nowhere. Use google before asking anything, it was really helpful for me in picking up the basics and finding solutions to a lot of problems. Last but not least try to use some level of formal english on the forums, we can’t help you if we can’t understand you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What do you do nowadays?</span><br>
I am in University seeking an AA and AS degree in video game development. You can still catch me on IRC talking about my hobbies, which include being a Tae Kwan Doe black-belt and collecting firearms.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Inspiration!</span><br>
If you stick around, follow the rules and contribute to the community you will gain respect from the veteran members and learn valuable skills that will aid you in your future, on and off the forums.</p>
