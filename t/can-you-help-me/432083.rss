    <description>Okay, I have my client ready for putting in jar file.

I&#39;m running a 317 PI and Im trying to make a webclient/client.jar file. I made it but when I put it on to my laptop and test it I&#39;m getting &quot;Could not find the main class: client. Program will exit.&quot;

Yes, I have made the correct manifest to client. My friend made one on his computer and it works fine. I tried to test a different jar maker and still the same. I&#39;m not sure what can cause this. Someone please try to help me!!!</description>
