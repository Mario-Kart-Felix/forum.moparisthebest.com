    <title>How to improve my speed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-improve-my-speed/470303</link>
    <description>Track season is about to start for me, and I really love the 400 meter dash. I&#39;m one of the top Sophomores in my county and the primary runner at the school(we have a really shitty track program atm), but that&#39;s not really good enough for me. I really want to know how to improve my 400 time, like what workouts, ect. I also have plenty of cardio due to the Cross Country season ending only 3 weeks ago.

I was thinking a good workout would be four 100m repeats, four 200m repeats, and maybe four 400m repeats. But I really have no idea... 

My best time freshmen year was about 55.04 which dropped about 3 seconds from my previous best, and I&#39;m hoping to drop another 3 seconds this year.

Has anyone here trained for the 400m before? If so what were your work outs, and any other tips you can give me.</description>

              <p>One thing that hasn’t been mentioned is High Intensity Training. HIT or interval training will make you faster and give you more endurance. I won’t go into a lengthy pedantic explanation but it’s one of the best things you can do for anaerobic training and fast twitch muscle growth and development.</p>

              <p>I do track as well, but everything TEA listed is true.</p>
<p>I got a trainer at my local gym, the best thing that helps me is working your core. not your legs, not your arms, but your core. Yes it is good to work other but you are already running etc so I will tell you the core stuff. There’s a thing called a “Core Ball” well it is just a regular exercise ball. There a basic exercises with this and your core is the most important part. Try to get a trainer to help you at the local gym. It’s very much improved my speed.</p>
<p>Hope this helped.</p>

</aside>
<p>I do plenty of long distance, I just finished the cross country season. Our workouts were</p>
<p>Monday - 10 miles<br>
Tuesday - 8 miles<br>
Wednesday - track workout, usually speed work<br>
Thursday - Mile repeats, or more speed work<br>
Friday - Easy day, because it was the day before our meets. Usually only ran like 1 or 2 miles.</p>
<p>We have a new sprinting coach, so I’m not to sure if he’ll send us on some distance runs, but I’ll try to find a way to get them in.</p>

<p>I actually used to do that in Football conditioning, but I live in Florida, so we don’t have many hills. We do run up the stadium though, which isn’t the same, but it’s got similar concepts.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t mean to sound conceded, but I’ve got really good form. I had a personal trainer for about 2 summers that helped me perfect my form. Also, my Mom being a state champion back in the day is really picky about my form.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tips. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
