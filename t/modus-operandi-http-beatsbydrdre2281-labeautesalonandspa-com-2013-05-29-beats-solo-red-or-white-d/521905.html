        <p>There was a heavyweight diet plan summit Thursday in Washington. The biggest, best-selling labels in the field met to talk over the strategy to lose those pounds, and it turned into any not-always-polite food fight. Abc News Medical Surgeon Elizabeth Kaledin has the story. When experts are summoned to Washington, it’s usually to discuss warfare, peace, the economic system. So this summit was a little unusual. These leaders were best-selling diet regime authors and the turmoil they face may be the nation’s growing circumference.“That’s the problem in this region: We eat an excessive amount of!” says Daniel Glickman, Secretary of Agriculture.Therefore, at the secretary’s request, the country’s diet gurus shared the stage to shed a little light on their dubious and contradictory diet plans. Some say the morning meal of champions is high in fat and lacking in carbohydrates. Dr. Robert Atkins starts with a three egg omelette, avocado and a couple strips of bacon. Others say fat causes heart disease, therefore the lower the fat the higher. A meat-based diet is less healthful as a plant-based eating habits, says Dr. Dean Ornish.The thing they all agree on is refined sugars could be unhealthy and more exercise is excellent. Maybe the question of the items to eat wouldn’t be such a big debate whether it wasn’t such a huge business: Americans commit about $30 billion annually on diet textbooks and products. The Atkins book alone provides over six million replicates in print. But not anyone thinks much of his advice. “Telling people that pig rinds and sausages is good for you might sell books, but it is irresponsible,” says Dr. Ornish. Some eating habits gurus weren’t perhaps that polite about their colleagues’ work.For baffled dieters watching this excellent nutrition debate, minor was settled. The federal government says it won’t recommend any diet, however in this era of unprecedented obesity, it seems government guidelines aren’t doing work either. So in the meantime, the government has joined up with the national obession with locating a diet that works.  <a href="http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutletstore.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">gucci outlet store</a><br>

Investigators in the Swissair plane crash are confident they’re going to figure out what really took place during the fateful moments before the plane split up. But it won’t be easy. There’s no record from the flight’s last six moments. CBS News Writer Liz Gonzalez reports that divers are working under extremely tough conditions. Specialists released the first video of underwater wreckage from Swissair Flight 111. Divers are working in more than 100 ft below the surface of the normal water off Peggy’s Cove, where visibility is difficult and the water is extremely cold. And the conditions can be expected to be able to deteriorate as the fall season progresses.Administrators also say small pieces of the plane’s wreckage cover a wide place. There are sharp perimeters that make recovery gradual, difficult and probably hazardous if not done correctly. Recovering more bodies from the wreckage is really a top priority, as is the recovery of bits of the cockpit and also engine parts which could give more clues as to why the jet went down. Authorities say that, given the quantity of the actual flight data and further clues, they are positive about determining in which the problem first came to exist. But the recorder might not hold all of the replies.©1998 Cbs television studios Worldwide Inc., Most Rights Reserved  <a href="http://www.prevoir-labelvie.com/michaelkors.com.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.prevoir-labelvie.com/michaelkors.com.html</a><br>
They’re used to living in the mountains and ice regarding Japan. But now numerous snow monkeys tend to be learning how to adapt to a good unrelenting South Colorado heat wave. You may expect to see these monkeys in Australia or Cameras, but at the Snowfall Monkey Sanctuary within South Texas, greater than 400 Japanese monkeys?—which would normally end up being living in mountains and snow?—are trying to accept high temperatures.Reports About Animals"These guys are survivors," states caretaker Lou Griffin. "These guys have modified to the horrendous good quality of South Arizona life."Griffin helps conserve the monkeys?—feeding them and also providing medical care?—but she lets them are in the wild and learn how to survive.They’re literally called Japanese snow monkeys, on the other hand adaptation to the intense cold has been translated to the extreme heat. You can walk in the snow and not get frostbite. However, you can also walk inside the sand when it’s A hundred thirty degrees and not melt away your toes.“This is amongst the ways the Japanese snowfall monkeys have designed to living in Southerly Texas,” Griffin affirms. "In Japan, they would utilize water to stay comfortable. Here in South Arizona, they use the water to chill off."Water is a useful resource, and the monkeys spend their nights in the shade associated with trees.“They’re smarter as compared to we are,” Griffin affirms. "They come out early in the particular morning and late in the evening."Griffin says annually some monkeys pass away because of the heat. But it is usually not this undesirable."This is probably the worst year we’ve had in 10 years, because as you’ve seen, despite the fact that we have a swimming opening and we’ve got a properly, we can’t even ensure that it stays full because of the evaporation. So we’re suffering like everybody throughout South Texas."And just like everybody in Southerly Texas, they’re looking for ways to survive. So far, their own animal instincts tend to be paying off.

A driver with The Evening News newspaper opened fire with a shotgun Thurs . at the newspaper’s office, killing the circulation manager, police said. Police hunted for the driver, Nathan Hanna, who apparently fled in his pickup truck. Staff scrambled under desks or hid in the darkroom following the gunman, apparently aimed for circulation manager Anthony Gillespie, 48, killing him along with two shotgun blasts, said Editor Ken Fazzari, who called 911 from with a desk. Hanna didn’t state anything before he started shooting, Fazzari said. “This is just a total shock and i am still shaking, have already been all day,” Fazzari mentioned. Police Officer John Weist stated Hanna had been fired through the newspaper. But Fazzari said to his knowledge, Hanna used to be an employee. Workers within buildings nearby were advised to lock themselves in after the strike, and SWAT units encircled the newspaper office buildings for four hours, right up until police determined simply no hostages were taken. Officials escorted 14 people from the building, while others got out on their own just after the shooting. Some were taken to a healthcare facility to be evaluated emotionally and physically. Lex Walsh, whose barber shop is about 100 feet from your building, said your paper’s receptionist escaped and ran for you to his barber shop, incredibly distraught and declaring others were stored in the building. The newspapers is on Michigan’s Top Peninsula, about 350 a long way north of Detroit on the Canadian border. It possesses a circulation of about 6,300. The cardstock ordinarily publishes each day but Saturday. Fazzari said the paper has not been published Thursday and possibly won’t come out once more before Monday.Compiled by John Flesher  <a href="http://www.prevoir-labelvie.com/ralphlaurenoutlet.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.prevoir-labelvie.com/ralphlaurenoutlet.html</a><br>
Jim Meehan was addicted to cocaine for 20 years, reviews CBS News Reporter John Roberts ."Initially it was the nose, then it grew to become smoking crack and after that it was exclusively using tobacco crack cocaine,Inches says Meehan. "It was impossible for me to say no to."Even by using a hospital program, giving up smoking took extraordinary energy.However, scientists from your Brookhaven Laboratories announced Thursday that in experiments with rats and also baboons, a new drug was discovered to break the cycle of habit.“We’ve let animals self-administer crack as much as they want,” said Stephen Dewey of Brookhaven Laboratories. "And we give them this kind of compound and they cease."Cocaine causes addiction by activating dopamine – a human brain chemical responsible for delight and reward. This particular new drug, "GVG,Inches originally developed for epilepsy, blocks the production of dopamine and removes the pleasure of employing cocaine.Addiction specialist Dr. Alex De Luca states it could be a powerful new weapon against cocaine, but only as part of a thorough treatment program.“Cocaine will be that much easier for a person who’s motivated to quit to steer clear of it,” claims De Luca. "By itself, I do not think it will be a remedy in any sense."Because of how it works in the human brain, researchers say this drug could also be efficient at treating other harmful addictions such as nicotine. Nevertheless, it is a long way from rodents and baboons to human beings and there are other drug treatments for treating cocaine which showed promise throughout animals – but didn’t work for people.Reported by simply John Roberts©Before 2000, CBS Worldwide Incorporated., All Rights Set aside  <a href="http://www.prevoir-labelvie.com/michaelkors.com.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">michaelkors.com</a></p>
