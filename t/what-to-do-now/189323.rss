    <description>Well I started to play runescape again after probably after 6 months. Well I got membership and did pest control and castle and other things like that. I got my hunter all the way to 68. I am currently trying to Full Dharak. Then after I buy it and then I will train on experiments to get my attack to 70, strength to 70, and the hardest, defense to 61. Well now I want to know what you guys think I should do. I am going to have about 4 days to hunt red chins so that I can get Full Dharak. If I can get a whip but i just want Full Dharak. Can you guys tell me if I am doing this right.

[center][size=18pt]Goals[/size][/center]



[ul][li]Get Full Dharak[/li][/ul]
Solution- Hunt Red Chins about 3.6k of them

[ul][li]Get Stats to wear Full Dharak[/li][/ul]
 Solution- Kill Experiments

[ul][li]Get Whip[/li][/ul]
Hunt Red Chins about 2.3k of them

[ul][li]Play God Wars Dungeon with items that I don&#39;t mind losing.(I don&#39;t want to lose all the stuff I work so hard for)[/li][/ul]
Solution-??????????????????????????????

[ul][li]Then I Don&#39;t know what I want to do[/li][/ul]

              <p>Thanks pkapk and taharok. Just to let you know I have a 5 day break which means 5 days of runescape so I am ready to work my ass off. pk4pk pm me your email.</p>
<p>Edit I was wondering if runecrafting nature runes would be faster with the abyss</p>

<p>So think of it this way. If you get 1k Dbones and green hides you should have more than what you need in 400 trips or so</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Do the math. If you can make 40k every 20 minutes, and assuming you will stay consistent, that means it will take you about 1300 minutes, which is around 21.7 hours. If you play ten hours a day (assuming you do), it would take you less than three days to get full dharok and an abyssal whip. By the way, don’t ask for suggestions unless you are FULLY ready to actually do them. I personally despise all runescapers who complain about getting off their ass to work. If you want dharok and a whip, you will have to work hard until you get it.</p>

Bandits are at bandit camp they are like levels 15-25 and if you want quick and easy exp there about 150 a kill and each kill with a d scim and your levles should be 10seconds</p>
