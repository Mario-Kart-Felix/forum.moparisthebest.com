    <title>Donation page [Halloween themed][NOT released]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/donation-page-halloween-themed-not-released/463023</link>
    <description>One of my more recent projects I&#39;ve been working on, is a simple to manage, simple to edit donation page. Where you don&#39;t have to do much to get it online and your players donating right away. In spirit of Halloween, I&#39;ve made it black and orange.

OLD:

NEW:

It DOES NOT feature auto donation, as I have nothing to do with server sided anything anymore. Though, I&#39;m sure, you could edit the MySQL database to include a display name, and have the server grab. That would also mean your website allows remote MySQL connections.

Currently, I&#39;m working on a couple MySQL errors, and I need to find some sort of way to make sure it works. As I have 0.00 in my paypal, and I would need to either donate to my spare acc, or have someone donate. But in time, I&#39;ll solve that.

The pie graph was made by google, I just edited it to be orange (You can change the color too) and I have no clue why there is a white line on it. google has a whole resource center of graphs.

Comments?
Please no hate.
Edit:
Upon request by The Web Guy, here is my donate.php code. I know it&#39;s shitty and horrid looking, but I&#39;m not good with php.
[code=php]&lt;?php

require &quot;config.php&quot;;
require &quot;connect.php&quot;;

// Determining the URL of the page:
$url = &#39;http://&#39;.$_SERVER[&#39;SERVER_NAME&#39;].dirname($_SERVER[&quot;REQUEST_URI&quot;]);
$goal = 500;
// Fetching the number and the sum of the donations:
list($number,$sum) = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query(&quot;SELECT COUNT(*),SUM(amount) FROM dc_donations&quot;));
$sum = 375;
// Calculating how many percent of the goal were met:
//$percent = round(min(100*($sum/$goal),100));
$percent = 75;
//Calculating how much is still needed to reach our goal.
$left = $goal - $sum;
// Building a URL with Google&#39;s Chart API:
//$chartURL = &#39;http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chf=bg,s,000000&amp;amp;cht=p&amp;amp;chd=t:&#39;.$percent.&#39;,-&#39;.(100-$percent).&#39;&amp;amp;chs=200x200&amp;amp;chco=FF4103&amp;amp;chp=1.57&#39;;

<p>Yea, I agree with the above. To be honest having just plain text for the goal is even worse than the graph was, I suggest you just remove the goal part for now. Also use the header types (</p>
<h1> etc) to have some good font sizes, ‘donor list’ shouldn’t be the same size as the main header (should be smaller). I also think the gray background is just confusing. The images are a bit spaced apart for such a large space, it looks quite empty.

<p>The plain text was only there as a temporary holder till I found a way to make the bar graph.<br>
I’ll look into some modifications later.</p>

I’d love to, but my xampp server (what is holding all my php files etc.) is being lame, and google chrome says it can’t connect to localhost. So yeah. I might have to import to a webhost real fast.<br>

<p>I agree I don’t like the elitist approach he has in his posts, but he is right. It doesn’t look good. But I also understand where you come from when you say you want to do everything from scratch, it’s not very logical but I experience the same feeling when I develop Java; I don’t like to use external libraries to do work for me (like LWJGL for games, MINA/Netty for networking, etc) just because I feel like it’s not as much of an accomplishment for me.</p>
<p>I would suggest you completely redesign this, it really doesn’t make sense at all the way it is laid out. And scratch the pie chart idea. If you really want to have a graph, make it a filling up thermometer or a bar/line graph. The text is also kinda weird, being left aligned when everything else is centered and the spacing seems strange.[/quote]<br>

<p>I agree I don’t like the elitist approach he has in his posts, but he is right. It doesn’t look good. But I also understand where you come from when you say you want to do everything from scratch, it’s not very logical but I experience the same feeling when I develop Java; I don’t like to use external libraries to do work for me (like LWJGL for games, MINA/Netty for networking, etc) just because I feel like it’s not as much of an accomplishment for me.</p>
<p>I would suggest you completely redesign this, it really doesn’t make sense at all the way it is laid out. And scratch the pie chart idea. If you really want to have a graph, make it a filling up thermometer or a bar/line graph. The text is also kinda weird, being left aligned when everything else is centered and the spacing seems strange.</p>

Usually there is something good in a design, then it is helpful to comment what should be improved. In your design everything should be redone.</p>

<p>Again, people like you are why I don’t like to be on this site. You give me no effort for writing my OWN CODE. Not using a program that assists in making it FOR ME.

Instead of BASHING on it, why not give suggestions on how to improve it, besides the images and nav bar, as I’m working on those right now. I also changed the dropdown (besides the carrot, I don’t know how to exactly) too.<br>

<p>I use paint to make the groundwork, then translate it into CSS. o.O</p>
