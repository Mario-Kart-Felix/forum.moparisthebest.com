[ul]Hi General Programmer&#39;s, I don&#39;t really go into this topic, but here I am!

So I&#39;m here today to talk about my series. I&#39;m here to create a Java series for beginner Java developers all the way up to professionals&#39; (if I get there). The aim of this mini-project is to help beginners to understand a bit more about Java, but not only that; it&#39;s to help me learn as well!
I know there are lots of articles out there teaching the basics behind Java, but I just thought it would be quite fun to create my own mini-article. I intend to make around four individual series, all holding around fifty - hundred text documents.
What I mean by Professional; I don&#39;t mean guru professional, I mean beginner professional. 


[size=14pt][u]Text document sizes?[/u][/size]

The text documents will be no more then 10kb, I don&#39;t want you reading over 200kb worth of text for every single document. The only reason for this is that it will take me like a year for each text document and it won&#39;t help you learn, you&#39;ll just be reading and reading and reading...
Though in the harder series the text documents will be some-what bigger.


[size=14pt][u]What I&#39;ve done so far that the beginner text documents cover;[/u][/size]

[list]
[li]Learning the use of Math Operators[/li]
[li]Increment Operators[/li]
[li]Learning the uses of Scanners&#39;[/li]
[li]Variables [/li]
[li]Interger&#39;s[/li]
[li]Creating basic calculators[/li]
[li]Use Methods with Parameters[/li]
[li]Methods[/li][/list]




[size=14pt][u]The Layout[/u][/size]

There are currently only two series; Intermediate series and Beginner series. I intend to make around four series; Intermediate, Beginner, Hard and Professional. As you can see I&#39;m only on Beginner series and I&#39;ve hardly started.

I do intend to clean it up, maybe by using Visual Basic, yes I know -.-.

[b]It&#39;s a very big goal, but I hope I learn just as much as you read.[/b][/ul]</description>
