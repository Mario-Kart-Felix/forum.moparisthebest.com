    <title>If wizardry was real</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/if-wizardry-was-real/528197</link>
    <description>Have you ever witnessed or done something totally out of the norm and something so out there it makes you wonder &quot;how&quot;? 

A friend of mine said that his younger brother got an essay on &quot;what if magic was real?&quot; and it got me thinking. Maybe it isn&#39;t magic per se... but some weird things out there DO happen. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised some of you smart people out there will try to justify the reason for whatever strange event in some form or another, however it DOES happen. Things happen out of the norm that do make us shake our head and how/why/what caused this?

So I ask you Mopar. If wizardry was real... would you believe in any type of existence/relative existence of it? Would you embrace it if you could?</description>

I genuinely believe anything is possible assuming the conditions are correct. The Universe exists, that’s enough reason for me to believe something that shouldn’t ever be possible happened.<br>

<p>hard to express the concept in words but I feel that because it does exist, it has to exist. So obviously it was something that was possible. I’d like to know if there are other universes, and if on a grander scale even bigger things go on. I wish I could survive the day till we have these kinds of answers.[/quote]<br>
But there are many things that exist that can’t and never have existed. For example, the Lord of the Rings novels talk about elves, goblins and orks however none have been proved to love or have lived. It was a figure of one man’s imagination, and it happens very frequently.</p>
<p>Even if it existed for the sake or existing, wouldn’t there be proof or evidence through other species that magic does indeed exist? However, this may be possible in other universes or on other planets even but i believe that the magic would be different to our understanding.</p>

</aside>
<p>People have been claiming magic is real for centuries and when asked to replicate the events, conveniently, they cannot.</p>
<p>Memory is NOT a recording device. Memories are constructions of events and can be manipulated or even created <span class="bbcode-b">VERY</span> easily. There’s a famous study on the matter, researchers showed a bunch of people a video of a traffic accident. When people were asked “how fast were the cars going when they <span class="bbcode-b">smashed</span> into each other”, those people gave higher estimates than the people who were asked “how fast were the cars going when they <span class="bbcode-b">hit</span> each other”. A week later, when asked if there was any broken glass involved, the group who received the question with <span class="bbcode-b">smashed</span> answered yes more than the people who were asked if the cars hit each other. There was no broken glass. People watched a video of an event, merely changing the word hit into smashed influenced people’s memory of the events to the extent that people who were asked about the cars being smashed into each other recalled the events that A) the cars were going faster, and B) the accident was much more substantial than it is.</p>
<p>Individual memory is flawed and easily corruptible. So, the logical solution is to ask more people who saw the events. But there’s also a problem with this, there’s another famous experiment in which people were asked simple questions. In the control group, people were asked questions and gave answers on a 1 on 1 basis, the person giving the answer gave their results directly to the researchers with no one else in the room. Less than 1% of the people in the control group gave a wrong answer. In the experimental group, 1 person was asked to give a question while 5 other people in the room were actors, whom were instructed to give the same wrong answer intentionally. In this experimental group, a whopping <span class="bbcode-b">75%</span> of non-actors who were part of the study gave a wrong answer at least once. This study showed that peer pressure and conformity can drastically change your opinions on something.</p>
<p>Memory can be influenced and peer pressure can play a massive role on someone’s opinions. If a flash of light, with another circle of light above this flash of light appears for a brief second, and if this event is witnessed by a bus full of people, and if one of the people claims it was an angel, what do you think will happen? Do you think it’s more likely that this one time non-repeatable event was an angel, it was magic? A bus full of people are likely going to claim it’s an angel, therefore it was an angel right? The more likely answer is that humans are flawed, unless the event is repeatable, even a bus full of people’s testimonies don’t mean shit. When the event is repeatable, only THEN can you start to explain what it was, using objective methods not subjective ones. Claiming it’s magic because a bunch of people can’t explain it is exactly why science exist, science examines natural phenomena from an objective and critical standpoint.</p>

              <p>Strangely enough i was thinking about this the other day, and sadly nothing came to mind that would be considered ‘out of the ordinary’. I don’t believe wizardry is possible as we see no proof of it, or at least what we expect it to be. If magic was real, i doubt there would be a need to hide it as they do in various novels and movies.</p>
<p>It has been thought that to do magic, you need an extraordinary amount of brain power or to use your brain 100%. However, that shouldn’t be the case as nobody is able to access that much power of their brain. If anyone ever did access near the full amount of brain, it would be seen as a child and questioned before they even understood what was happening. Precocious children are never ignored, and for that reason i think it would be improbable for magic to be possible.</p>
<p>Excusing the use of the brain from magic, we would not be the only species on earth able to access said power. Thus seeing it in other animals, such as our ancestors. If animals had this ability, they would not hide it as they wouldn’t consider how dangerous possessing such abilities would be. Also, the don’t have the understanding of magic like we assume we do. Again, without another species being able to show magical abilities it seems highly improbable.</p>

<p>A friend of mine said that his younger brother got an essay on “what if magic was real?” and it got me thinking. Maybe it isn’t magic per se… but some weird things out there DO happen. I wouldn’t be surprised some of you smart people out there will try to justify the reason for whatever strange event in some form or another, however it DOES happen. Things happen out of the norm that do make us shake our head and how/why/what caused this?</p>
<p>So I ask you Mopar. If wizardry was real… would you believe in any type of existence/relative existence of it? Would you embrace it if you could?</p>
