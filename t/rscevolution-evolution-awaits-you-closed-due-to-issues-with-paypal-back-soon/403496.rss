<p>No, snoopy told you about webdav and I have never mentioned that you talked to Keith.</p>

</aside>
<p>The webDav exploit is old, sure I didn’t know of it at first. But I’m pretty sure its fixed in the latest xampp. There’s other exploits with xampp other than the webDav that I’m pretty sure you don’t know. &amp; I wasn’t going on to exploit him, I just wanted to see what it looked like. &amp; the FTP exploit isn’t even really an exploit. I told snoopy/mario it. (Not saying I am the only one who knew them…)<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Webdav is no exploit, it is for everyone to change default passwords.<br>
you use not even last php, so what do you know about exploits?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">orly? I can see that you didn’t mean that, but thanks to snoopys crappy grammar everybody understands everything snoopy says wrong.</span></p>

No, actually you don’t need a translation for that, but I can’t say the same about you.</p>

<p>The webDav exploit is old, sure I didn’t know of it at first.

<p>What are you trying to say? WebDav is exploitable since most people don’t know about changing the default passwords. So anyone can upload a shell to it, which I’m pretty sure makes it exploitable. (Unless they secure it).</p>
<p>but I don’t get what you’re trying to say. It didn’t make sense for me. (not trying to be rude, I have nothing against you.).</p>
