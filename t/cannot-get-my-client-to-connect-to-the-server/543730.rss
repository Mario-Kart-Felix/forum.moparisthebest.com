    <title>Cannot get my client to connect to the server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cannot-get-my-client-to-connect-to-the-server/543730</link>
    <description>I have been trying to get my client to a point where I can share it with some friends but now I can&#39;t even seem to get it connected. I am running the ROME client/source [718].
I would love help over Skype if possible.
Skype: chris-finn21
I have been trying to setup a no-ip and my Environment Variables. It is very possible that I have done something wrong there, but I&#39;ve been at this for hours.
Any help would be amazing! Thank you!</description>
