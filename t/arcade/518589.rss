<p>I know when Taharok was first promoted there were some good changes going on, and we had the suggestion board which I really liked. I think he’s just on a bad schedule atm, I guess we’ll see.</p>

<p>[quote=“Taharok, post:24, topic:518589”]I would love to implement something like this, but with community-developed games. I was considering adding something like this a while back, but simply haven’t. I’d be willing to reconsider it if we rekindle the gamedev side of this community.</p>
<p>Ie: play as many games as you want, but as many as the community has developed. Could have an arcade with 3 games or 30 games. Gives people a nice incentive to do game development, get feedback on their efforts, and allows the community members to have fun in the process. Seems like a good plan to me.</p>
<p>Thoughts?[/quote]<br>
Would the arcade section be cut up based on what the game is made in?<br>
Ex: Sections for Unity, Flash, Java, HTML5/Javascript/Etc, and so on?</p>
