    <title>Does anybody have a working item-on-npc packet?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anybody-have-a-working-item-on-npc-packet/352190</link>
    <description>The packet number for it is 57, but mine doesn&#39;t seem to work. I&#39;ve tried ripping it from previous sources I&#39;ve downloaded, and I&#39;ve searched for it on here and checked every single thread it popped up. I just need the basics for it, I don&#39;t need examples in it. And I&#39;m using a 317 version, if that helps.. Thanks.</description>
