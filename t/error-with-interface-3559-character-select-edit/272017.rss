    <title>Error with interface 3559 (Character Select/Edit)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-with-interface-3559-character-select-edit/272017</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m using a 377 Client (as far as I&#39;m aware) and I can&#39;t seem to get character editing working (the way characters look; hair, torso etc.).

This is the problem:

Ok, here you can see the interface works fine. But when you click the arrows on the left hand side, your character in the middle doesnt update on the interface, (so you can&#39;t see what you look like) but he does when you Accept.

Here on the right hand side arrows, when you click one, the client crashes and no changes are made to your character.

This is the error message that comes up when ANY of the arrows are pressed on the right hand side. I&#39;m assuming this is client-side since I don&#39;t get a server-side error.


What needs fixing;

1. The interface needs to show what you change on your character
2. The right hand side arrows need to stop crashing the client



Will I need a while new interface? If so; I&#39;m not sure how to make one so if someone could provide one that would be great :)

Any help on fixing this is greatly appriciated :)
