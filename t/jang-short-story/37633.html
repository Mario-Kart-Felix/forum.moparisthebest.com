<p>“To succeed in the other trades, capacity must be shown; in the law, concealment of it will do” ~Mark Twain</p>
<p>Jang</p>
<p>Night fell resentfully on Oakgate, as if daytime had stayed long overdue. Along the wide suburban streets streetlamps flickered to life, and from the windows of generic yet tasteful houses the warm glow of television sets seeped gently down to the chemically perfected lawns below. Squirrels flitted deftly from the tops of telephone wires to the spindly branches of the communities namesake oak trees, and a bird flew into the glass sliding doors of a beautiful starter home, crushing it’s own small body in a desperate attempt at…something.</p>
<p>Behind the glass window Jang sipped wine straight from the 10$ bottle. He watched passively as the bird fell to the ground. It was a pretty little blue thing, and if he was sentimental Jang might have walked to the doors and glanced down, taking a deep swig on his wine and contemplating life, death, and how shit-stupid drunk he had got himself on cheap wine. Jang had no feelings to spare for the bluebird that ended its small glow of consciousness in such a glorious flash of pain and self-destruction, and no desire to leave the center of his new couch.</p>
<p>Jang stood up like a boxer getting up at the ninth count, lilting dangerously to the left, but catching his balance on an end table artfully decorated with empty cigarette packs. Jang felt as if he had grown taller while drinking, increasing his already above-average height so he was looking down on the floor from a great distance. Though a God with a sense of humor had gifted Jang with good looks, he was tall and had a square jaw with friendly crinkly eyes that always seemed to be winking at you, the same god had also neglected to provide Jang with any sense of personal hygiene or desire to maintain himself in a manner attractive to members of the opposite sense. He was wearing what looked like a dinner jacket and suit that he had slept in for a week straight, adorned with colorful stains that could have been exotic food or alcoholic drinks with interesting flavors.</p>
<p>Jang took a quick inventory of his worldly possessions. He had four camel cigarettes in his left back pocket, a bic lighter in the right, and an unopened bottle of 12$ wine on the floor (surprising even himself at this luxury), and a glock22C in the right front pocket of his suit.</p>
<p>Jang was renting the house from an associate in Toronto. His good friend had promised him the best of US suburbia:</p>
<p>“The kids will pay top dollar for shit weed.” He heard Jackson’s gravelly voice in his ears. “It’s a few miles outside of the city, you can pick up whenever you want, get whatever you need. Plenty of gun and liquor stores around, too, if you travel in a straight line for a few minutes.”</p>
<p>Jang had nodded. He never had a hard time finding what he needed.</p>
<p>Yet now he was having a hard time doing what he did best, flipping buds. He had picked up an ounce a day for the past week, and had barely pushed a hundred grams. As the thought of his unsold stash of fine Afghani Royal crossed his mind, he knew had to enjoying a small spliff while contemplating his game plan for the next morning.</p>
<p>Jang dropped to his hand and knees, feeling around for the rolling papers he knew he had dropped somewhere around the couch. The doorbell rang suddenly, with a three chord burst which caused Jang to jump nervously to his feet. Probably a customer.</p>
<p>Jang had never known fear in his life. He had sold marijuana since before he smoked his first cigarette, his first high had been the flush of success, and he was still riding the peak. Sure, there had been times when he had been worried that things might not come through, and days when he wasn’t sure what tomorrow was going to bring him, but he had never been afraid for his life. He was always ready for any eventuality, Jang always had a backdoor.</p>
<p>Jang slid back the cover on the viewer on the peek-hole. The magnifier rounded and stretched the image of the teenager standing on Jangs’ porch. It was a customer.</p>
<p>Felix was not a pothead. He smoked weed as much as he could, the best weed he could find, for whatever he could get it for. Yet he always considered himself a step above the common stoner. He had something, what was the word? Ah yes, he remembered, as he indented Jangs doorbell with practiced nonchalance, the word was Panache.</p>
<p>Felix smoked with style, using a hookah not a bong, smoking hash when it was available over pot or making his own when the mood struck him. Felix usually smoked by himself, there was rarely anybody who Felix deemed worthy around.</p>
<p>He was known in Oakgate as a grocery store night-shift bagger. To the stoners in the surrounding area as a hard-ass, boggarting, high school dropout, with a superiority complex. He was known to the local police as a single, constant, victimless crime. There was nothing they could do about him and nothing they wanted to.</p>
<p>The day before Felix had bought eighteen grams of marijuana from Jang. Jang pulled open the door.</p>
<p>“What up” mumbled Jang happily.</p>
<p>“Where’s my .5 grams bitch?” Felix eyes burned with the passion of somebody who knows they are right. Jang had shorted his bag by half a gram. Barely enough to roll a small joint, but to Felix, it was the world. His small Japanese scale, purchased only days before on ebay, was one of his most prized possessions.</p>
<p>“Oh.” Jang said. Slightly surprised Felix had noticed. Jang usually undersold his bags by at least .5</p>
<p>“Fuck. You.” Jang finally let out, slowly and deliberately. And moved to shut the door.</p>
<p>Felix pulled his Military Armament Corporation Model 10 blowback operated submachine gun up from his side where it had been hanging loosely, blending in with his faded jeans, invisible to the drunken Jang. His left hand stopped the closing motion of the door. The right arm continued its upward motion, his arms crisscrossing with the barrel of the MAC10 just barely poking into the front of Jangs white dress shirt.</p>
<p>“Shit.”</p>
<p>30 rounds pumped through Jangs body in less than two seconds, splattering a mixture of cheap wine and blood in every direction.</p>
