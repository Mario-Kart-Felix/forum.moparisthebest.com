    <title>Desert Treasure; worth 11 prayer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/desert-treasure-worth-11-prayer/25592</link>
    <description>I have a Mage/Meele pure. I was wondering if it would be worth it to do Desrt Treasure, but I hate that you have to do Priest In Peril for 11 prayer. Should I do it for Ice Barrage, or just you entangle/snare?</description>

              <p>Yeah, entangle + zammy flames/sara strike/claws guthix works fine for me. I have a pure with 75 range 77 mage mage and it works fine. I wouldnâ€™t do desert treasure unless I already had 94 mage, like Paul said.</p>

              <p>I always thought entangle/snare+zammy flames worked fine, but in my humble opinion 11 prayer is worth it if you already have 94 mage, or enough runes to get there.</p>
