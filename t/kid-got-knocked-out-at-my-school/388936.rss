    <description>So, because im insanely bored im going to tell you guys some crazy shit that went down during lunch today. So as usual i get my food and go sit down with all my buddies, it&#39;s a sunny day, everybody&#39;s in a good mood, finally did all my homework, so im also in a GROOVY mood. My friend Vlad, he&#39;s pretty big(buff). He&#39;s been in training with all my cousins since he was 6 years old, he did MMA for 3 years, and recently started boxing. So, now, during lunch, 2 Mexicans would always fuck up to him because his last name is Smirnoff. Yes were all Russian. They would joke around but today one of them, his name is Manuel decided to bring a Smirnoff sticker ripped off a bottle and slap it on his forehead. It was a fairly loud slap so everybody turned to look. Im sitting next to him(Vlad) and i see hes turning reeaallyy red, like he was embarrassed, he just got punked pretty badly. So bunch of us Russians get up to back up or brother, but all we see is him(Vlad) hopped out of the tabled, threw him literally about 5 feet, jumped on him and started beating the fuck out of him, So it&#39;s all crazy and shit until we noticed Manuel was knocked out, completely. And all we see if Vlad going all out on his face, It was insane. Blood was everywhere, im trying to find a video so i can show all you. But basically i called him about 40 mins ago and he said he blacked out and didn&#39;t know what was going on, he snapped out of it about 50 seconds into hitting him in the face, perfect shots. He got expelled, nothing big. He broke Manuels nose, knocked out 5 teech, broke his jaw, and fractured some bone above the eye. Well pretty much the skull. I just cant belive i was right infront of my bro when this went down, i felt hella bad fom Manuel too. :/ Thanks for listening to this boring story. If you got any stories about fighting please post them here. ILY.</description>

<p>Take your pick.  They all tell you the exact same things.  The only thing I’ve found mentioned is if you use excessive force against someone, they can count your hands/feet as a lethal weapon (Which that’s for anybody, not just people that’s had training), but you don’t “register” as one.</p>
<p>My best friend is a black belt in Jiu Jitsu and he’s working on Muay Thai, he’s not had to register for anything.  He’s also training in one of Jorge Gurgel’s gyms here in WV.</p>

              <p>From the link that you posted wildyscape. The first answer says this:</p>
<blockquote>Research has failed to reveal any statutory, regulatory or other requirement that boxers -- or anyone skilled in martial arts -- "register" their hands or any other body part as "lethal weapons" in the U.S., UKoGBaNI, Canada, or any other common law nation. However, a criminal defendant's experience in boxing, karate, or other forms of hand-to-hand combat may be relevant to determining various legal issues.</blockquote>
<p>In the future you might also want to post a reputable source. The majority of people who answer the questions on that site are idiots who aren’t qualified.</p>
<p>Another thing I don’t agree with.</p>
<blockquote>most MMA fighters can hit 10 times harder than any human being that isnt in MMA.</blockquote>
<p>That is ridiculously untrue. I would love to introduce you to my dads buddy Kurt. He’s a master of some form of martial arts, I can’t remember which, and I can guarantee he is more of a deadly weapon then any man you’ve ever met.</p>

              <p>alrighty, look it up then punks, if your in mma or your hands are registered as lethal weapon in most states, because most MMA fighters can hit 10 times harder than any human being that isnt in MMA. Same as a soldier, soldiers are deadly weapons when they come back from war because they are mainly trained to kill… Get the facts before you go about flaming, i will not lie about my life… I started the fight, if it was to defend myself then i would be aloud to, but since i started the fight i was charged as a “lethal/deadly weapon” luckily charged as a Delienquent and not an Adult because i was only 15 when this happened. If i was 16 i would have been tried as an adult and would have been sentenced to jail time for it. Believe me, its not cool to fight. If this was all a lie then why would i be telling people not to fight? People who lie about it are the people who tell people oh yeah beat the fuck out of more people, and those are the people who have never fought in their lives…</p>

Well, me being in both MMA and Boxing before, its best to take both, as he said MMA is mainly takedowns and submissions, very little hitting. Boxing gives you the accuracy of the shots, where to hit, and even speed as you hit the speedbag daily during your daily workouts, it also gives good cardio concidering you jump rope daily aswell. I aswell went from MMA to Boxing, that is why im on probation for over a year now because im “a deadly weapon” in the state of Indiana because i have done MMA and boxing and got into a fight at school.

<p>M.Dog put a cock in it and listen to this. ^[/quote]Yes, listen to the guy lying about having to register as a lethal weapon because he got in a fight at school.  The main point of learning any martial art is to defend yourself.  So giving you the benefit of the doubt that you may have actually had training, you wouldn’t have actually fought back trying to hurt the kid, instead you’d just be trying to defend yourself.  Martial Arts mainly trains you in self control.</p>

Obviously you haven’t.  MMA has no real form of strength training.  MMA is all martial arts, and if you have ever actually seen someone who does martial arts, they’re not very big.  Martial arts is more speed, agility, and accuracy than muscle.  People who do it are fit more than anything.</p>
