    <description>Every so often I venture over to Runescape to see whats going on

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ironman Mode

Free players and members

Ever wondered how fast you could progress through RuneScape without the help of anyone else? No trade, no helpful multiplayer minigames, no Treasure Hunter, no LootShare, no gifts from friends? If so, Ironman is for you!

Ironman is a brand new way of playing RuneScape, developed by you, but now with official support from Jagex.

It’s all about self-sufficiency, earning or making everything you use when playing the game. You&#39;ll be able to create a new account and set it to Ironman mode, fending for yourself and knowing that all your achievements are your own.

If you’d like an even greater challenge, our Hardcore Ironman mode features permadeath with two earnable lives. After that it’s game over.

There are brand new hiscore tables to support each of the modes so you’ll be able to gloat about your adventures to everyone!

For more information about Ironman, keep an eye on Mod Pips&#39;s Ironman forum post, or watch BTS Video 119:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

seem&#39;s like a cool update to me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BifkV2C5bI#t=275</description>

<p>It isn’t a waste of time if we are paying to play their game. Cost’s $65+ USD a year to play their game, the least they can do is give us fancy holiday events.[/quote]Considering the content is also free to play and isn’t permanent, yes it is a waste of developers time.   It doesn’t cost anything a year to play their game.  It’s your choice to buy membership.  You’re not buying membership to play a holiday event.  You’re buying it to play the content that will always be there, or else it would just be a waste.  This is exactly why they stopped having drop events for holidays because people would miss out and take it way too seriously and cry over it.  So quit complaining about the events because at least you have something.</p>

<p>Does Jagex still ban your accounts?</p>
<p>OT: I think it’s an interesting idea. Going to be cool to see how people progress on their own. No buying 99’s, would like to see someone completely max on their own.</p>

<p>No</p>

<p>And damn it, this makes me want to renew my membership, again… My OSRS account on my main is like this, I try not to trade or anything. Only problem is I wish I could just enable it on my main, seems like an easy way for them to get money when you have to pay for more membership on a completely different account…</p>

              <p>Every so often I venture over to Runescape to see whats going on</p>
<blockquote>Ironman Mode
<p>Free players and members</p>
<p>Ever wondered how fast you could progress through RuneScape without the help of anyone else? No trade, no helpful multiplayer minigames, no Treasure Hunter, no LootShare, no gifts from friends? If so, Ironman is for you!</p>
<p>Ironman is a brand new way of playing RuneScape, developed by you, but now with official support from Jagex.</p>
<p>It’s all about self-sufficiency, earning or making everything you use when playing the game. You’ll be able to create a new account and set it to Ironman mode, fending for yourself and knowing that all your achievements are your own.</p>
<p>If you’d like an even greater challenge, our Hardcore Ironman mode features permadeath with two earnable lives. After that it’s game over.</p>
<p>There are brand new hiscore tables to support each of the modes so you’ll be able to gloat about your adventures to everyone!</p>
<p>For more information about Ironman, keep an eye on Mod Pips’s Ironman forum post, or watch BTS Video 119:</p>
