    <description> o know this maybe off topic but anyways

pking  is coming back



So, in 2008, we will be bringing you special &#39;PvP worlds&#39;, where you can fight other players almost anywhere! In addition to all the usual content you might expect to find in RuneScape, they will also include:

    * Optional sign-up – choose between PvP danger or stick to ordinary play by simply switching worlds.
    * High danger with items dropped on death.
    * High rewards for kills. To avoid any RWT issues the reward for a successful PK will be generated by the game, similar to    when you kill a monster at the moment. We&#39;re creating generous drop tables based on factors like your levels and the impressiveness of the kill.
    * These drop tables will include &quot;PvP world specific&quot; items like XP-modifying gear, lvl 70+ equipment and new, glorious, short-term but hard hitting gear. These will once again make PKing a viable source of income.
    * PvP across 99% of the world, including the old Wilderness.
    * Attack any player within a certain level of your own. Level range depends on the area, similar to the old Wilderness levels.
    * ...And all sorts of other twists on interesting content... Just think of the possibilities when you can PK anywhere!</description>
