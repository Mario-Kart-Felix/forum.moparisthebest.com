<p>This game is unbelievable. I know some of you are into RTS and this game is awe inspiring with games lasting over 16 hours.</p>
<p>I can’t be bothered describing it, there’s extensive information on the website but basically, you can do 8 player co-op, and people can and go as they please from the game. It’s also possible to save the game, and all come back to it later, so we can play successive games and post saved games on the forum while the next people take over for a few hours.</p>
<p>You NEED to do the tutorials on this game, takes only 30-60 mins but the controls are varied and complex. I’m still learning but I know a few people will be on this.</p>
<p>Get the game on steam for about £8 - definitely worth it.</p>
<p>EDIT: THIS TOPIC HAS BEEN BUMPED --&gt; Refer to latest post. OMG BAN ME.</p>

<p>There’s a reason for it and it’s a damn good one.</p>
<blockquote>f you want to play multiplayer on the harder difficulty levels, learning to work as an effective team is probably the most important skill there is. Other RTS games emphasize player v. player battles among semi-anonymous ladders and leagues online. With AI War, we wanted to provide an experience that emphasizes the exact opposite -- our modern armed forces are successful precisely because they train their soldiers and commanders how to work as a single unit, and we thought it was about time that a strategy game let friends experience something of that in their living rooms.</blockquote>
<p>It’s something totally new, and all the reviews are brilliant for it.</p>
<blockquote>AI War breaks most of the genre’s rules. Which is precisely why it’s incredible... This out-of-the-blue one-man passion project is one of this year’s finest strategy games.</blockquote>
<p>Also take into consideration its going to receive monthly updates of new ships and contents for free for 2-5 years. Because it’s a small gaming company you can guarantee it’ll last a long time and get lots of continuous work from the developers. The possibilities withing this game are quite endless but most people are too narrow minded to give it a go <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Hey guys, as the developer of the game, I can tell you that I generally fall into a similar category with RTS games.  I enjoy stuff set in space (Star Wars original trilogy, Descent: Freespace game, Ender’s Game novel, etc), but I’ve never enjoyed an RTS game set there.  So, that was something I aimed to fix with AI War – basically, my inspirations for the gameplay were more along the lines of CivIV, SupCom, and AoE3.</p>
<p>Regarding the other comments about longer not necessarily being better, I completely agree.  However, that said, there is something of a difference between 5-minute Speed Chess and a 4 hour game of Chess, by the same token.  In the case of RTS, for AI War the extra time lets you have a long chain reaction of effects based on every decision.  This is cool because the battlefield is continuously evolving as you play, with reactions to the decisions you make, which ultimately provides more variety and interest.</p>
<p>I built AI War primarily as a game for my own co-op play group to enjoy, and so aimed it at fixing the issues we had with the other RTS game’s we’d been playing over the last 10 or so years.  Chief among those were a number of co-op woes, a lack of variety between games, underwhelming AI opponents, games that go downhill after a certain crisis point against your opponents (it’s all easier from that stage on, etc, until you win), and the repetitive nature of playing two one-hour games per night where the general flow of each is always the same.  So hence having longer games, that build as they go, was an ideal solution to that last one, and all of the other points (plus others I’m sure I’m not thinking of) were also key things that I made a point to address.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m glad to see that Greeny and others are enjoying the game so much. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If there are any questions, feel free to let me know, or there’s a load of information about the game on the Arcen site, the wiki for the game, or the various reviews (PC Gamer, Boomtown, Co-Optimus, etc) for the game.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 26, 2009, 09:22:54 am[/size][hr][quote=“Speljohan, post:11, topic:310491”]I’d play if it was multiplayer vs players as that’s my main reason for rts’s[/quote]</p>
<p>By the way – that’s cool, this game might just not be for you.  Those who are diehard pvp fans certainly won’t find much to love with AI War.  However, if you think of AI War as something of a different genre altogether from your standard RTS (and really it is – is a combination of 4X, RTS, TBS, grand strategy, and tower defense all wrapped into an RTS control scheme), then you might enjoy this as something completely new.  For instance, in the past I have enjoyed bother Unreal Tournament (and later iterations), as well as Left 4 Dead, and they are two totally different experiences despite the presence of shooter mechanics in both.</p>
<p>In fact, I would argue that the true experience of Left 4 Dead could not be experienced any other way than as solo/co-op against the hordes of AI-controlled enemies (the versus mode their being a minor quasi-exception).  With AI War, it’s the same sort of thing.  You’re not fighting against bots, you’re fighting against a simulated fleet of opponents (and the AI is extremely good, some of the best in the genre by most accounts).</p>
<p>Still may not be your cup of tea, and that’s quite all right.  No game’s for everyone, and there are plenty of beloved RTS games that I can’t stand.  And others that I’ve written off because their AI was not good enough or they didn’t support co-op in a good enough way, or were missing random maps, etc. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">  Anyway, but I thought I’d chime in with a bit more about the motivations for this sort of design.</p>

<p>Dedication++, gotta give props for coming over to our little corner of the interwebs to talk about his game.</p>
<p>I think I will have to try the game out before I can decide on the whole longer games topic, but all I really meant was that every RTS I’ve played - including the supposed “hardcore” ones - that boasted long game times eventually just meant that once the players were familiar the playtime was divided into 10% interesting, varied play and 90% learned by-rote almost muscle memory procedure that was just being carried out in response to what was happening on the field. It got boring, frankly - like they stretched out the parts of RTS play that I don’t enjoy and not the fun parts.</p>
<p>That said, it’s pretty obvious that this is not the standard RTS. Apart from anything else, the comparison made to left4dead means I’ll probably give it a try, I loved the co-op vs AI thing.</p>

<p>That’s perfectly reasonable, and I understand why it might not be a good match for you.  For the same reason that pure pvp RTS games with no random maps, too little variety, and too poor AI are not good for me, even if they are awesome in pvp.  But cool that you’re going to give it a try, hope you find it a fun new sub-genre to play.</p>

<p>I think I will have to try the game out before I can decide on the whole longer games topic, but all I really meant was that every RTS I’ve played - including the supposed “hardcore” ones - that boasted long game times eventually just meant that once the players were familiar the playtime was divided into 10% interesting, varied play and 90% learned by-rote almost muscle memory procedure that was just being carried out in response to what was happening on the field. It got boring, frankly - like they stretched out the parts of RTS play that I don’t enjoy and not the fun parts.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m totally with you, to be honest.  My assessment of many RTS games that I play co-op was: 15 minutes of rote startup, 20 minutes of nearly-rote buildup (I’m a boomer), 20 minutes of interesting fighting, 10-20 minutes of fun-but-not-challenging smashing of the opponent.  Repeat.</p>
<p>With AI War, due to player suggestions we managed to automate the entire 15-minute rote startup period, so that you basically come out of the gate ready to go do something interesting.  I guess the overall structure of the game is less like an RTS, and more like a 4X such as CivIV, etc – just with RTS controls and play.  I always found CivIV addictive and loved how it built over a similar span of time to how AI War does, so that’s how I had modeled AI War.  Obviously, the proof is in the pudding, and no amount of me talking at you is going to convince you, but I think that it’s worthwhile to point out that my goals with the longer games were essentially to address the same complaints that you have with other games.  It’s not a case of “MOAR ships, more time, more strategeez!”  Rather, it’s all pretty well designed; that’s what netted us some of our better reviews, etc.</p>

<p>That said, it’s pretty obvious that this is not the standard RTS. Apart from anything else, the comparison made to left4dead means I’ll probably give it a try, I loved the co-op vs AI thing.</p>

<p>Yeah, reviewers have called it a mix of RTS, TBS, grand strategy, 4X, and tower defense, and I think that’s apt.  It’s pretty much a new subgenre of strategy, though at first glance it seems like an RTS since that’s how it controls.  If you’re interested in the unique AI and it’s design, you can read more about that here:  <a href="http://christophermpark.blogspot.com/2009/06/designing-emergent-ai-part-1.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://christophermpark.blogspot.com/2009/06/designing-emergent-ai-part-1.html</a></p>

<p>Yeah, sounds like it.  Other more recent strategy titles that I enjoyed (in addition to the ones that you mentioned, which are tops) were AoEIII, SupCom and its expansion, and CivIV.  Rise of Legends was okay, but I didn’t feel like it measured up to the original RoN.  If you like the older-school games, Empire Earth was another all-time favorite for me.  The first expansion was good, if I recall, but I think the second one was a bit less impressive.  The two sequels did not incite me to buy, for various reasons.  I’m all about the logistics, grand strategy, and group tactics, rather than about microing individual units.  Originally I was thinking about just doing an AI mod for SupCom, since we had exhausted the wiles of even the other AI mods for that game, but then I realized it would be more interesting in a lot of ways if I just made my own RTS that did everything exactly the way my play group was looking for.  So I did. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I read through your blog on the AI, and (being a programmer myself) it was a very interesting read. Seems like your company is going very well, and as an indie-supporter i will definately be buying the game (i usually buy indie-games with new interesting ideas as i want the gaming market to progress and stop being so stale in development)</p>

        <p>Much appreciated!  Yes, we’re definitely doing pretty well, although still not well enough to quit the day jobs yet.  But we’re definitely one of the “quiet hits” of the year so far.  If sales keep up at all like they’ve been since our release on Steam, we should be able to support ourselves with the business within a few months, but I suppose we’ll see how it goes.
