This game is unbelievable. I know some of you are into RTS and this game is awe inspiring with games lasting over 16 hours.

I can&#39;t be bothered describing it, there&#39;s extensive information on the website but basically, you can do 8 player co-op, and people can and go as they please from the game. It&#39;s also possible to save the game, and all come back to it later, so we can play successive games and post saved games on the forum while the next people take over for a few hours.

You NEED to do the tutorials on this game, takes only 30-60 mins but the controls are varied and complex. I&#39;m still learning but I know a few people will be on this.

Get the game on steam for about £8 - definitely worth it.

EDIT: THIS TOPIC HAS BEEN BUMPED --&gt; Refer to latest post. OMG BAN ME.</description>

              <p>I’m bumping this topic because for various personal life reasons I stopped playing with the intent to come back.</p>
<p>It’s taken me a couple of years to find the find time to start gaming again but it’s happened \o/</p>
<p>AI War was top of my list and I’ve been playing several hours a day to get used to the complex controls again. If anyone wants to play, message me on IRC!</p>
<p>The game has been heavily refined! Now version 5.000 with a much improved interface, and plenty of additional tools to minimise micromanagement (basically most core game refinements come from the suggestions of players, with a small niche player base it seems that if you make a decent suggestion chance of it being implemented is pretty high!). In addition there are DLCs with extensive features (which I cannot currently afford) so I’ll review these in the future when I can obtain them.</p>
<p>On the off chance x4000 discovers this thread again, I’d like to thank him once again because the reminder of his input here really sparked my interest in this game originally. Even if I didn’t have the time to play back then. Since then I’ve noticed video tutorials by your youtube user, extensive articles on the AI wiki (which have really helped me! Read nearly the entire wiki in the past 2-3 days) and further helpful posts on the AI War forums, which I should probably sign up to (if i haven’t already and forgotten).</p>
<p>There is also a small sub-reddit for this game: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/aiwar" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.reddit.com/r/aiwar</a><br>
As I know many here are redditors. I’m sure /v/ discovered it at some point too.</p>
<p>Dev is also releasing new game this month, not RTS but could be great based on how good AI war was:<br>

<p>AI WAR I (think) is still available as a demo for anyone who wants to try before they buy!</p>

<p>I agree.  Fortunately, I don’t have aspirations of making Arcen grow huge, so hopefully we’ll always retain a good level of customer-facing support.  I’ve worked in small companies (under 20 employees) my entire professional life, and I wouldn’t have it any other way, especially not with my own company.  Right now there’s 5 of us, and we might grow to 10 over the years if we’re really successful, but I can’t see growing much beyond that.  I never understand the indies that seem to want to forge some giant empire out of their small company, that seems to be defeating the point of being indie to me.</p>

<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>but I really can’t stand (for example) C++.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you don’t mind me asking, why is that?  I suppose everyone is somewhat biased in terms of their “primary” language and will always support it, however I am curious as to why you have those views on, obviously specifically enough, C++.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t have anything against C++ programmers, don’t get me wrong.  But, I find that it is not a terribly efficient language in terms of time.  On a personal level I don’t like the syntax and find it inconvenient to type (a minor nit, and I would get faster at that with practice, but -&gt; is slower to type than . no matter how you cut it).  I also really find the way that header files and similar force organization to be very substandard.  I also really miss certain features such as dictionaries, arraylists, generics, reflection, and so forth.  A lot of that has analogues in C++, but it’s more difficult to use in various ways, in the main.  I really prefer a lot of the way C# handles multithreading, as well, and garbage collection is pretty much a must in my opinion – the alternative causes a lot more design challenges than it is worth.  Of course, there are ways around that, but then you’re coding to the machine rather than to OOP design patterns, which I’m a huge fan of.  And so, I guess lastly, I really don’t like the OOP implementation in C++ (which seems to be a common enough sentiment).</p>
<p>For me, when it comes to deign and programming, C# is efficient, very quick to program, and almost as quick to run. It’s not quite as cross-platform in a sense of Operating Systems (yet), but it’s more cross-platform in terms of CPU architecture (with a single build) and there are various interpreters that can be created for other platforms not yet supported, or in existence (e.g., Mono support for the PS3, iPhone, etc).</p>
<p>Part of it comes down to the fact that C# is what I know best.  But every time I have to do something in C++, I just shudder at so many aspects of that environment, and it really pushes me away.  C#, Javascript, and T-SQL are all languages that I know really well and really like.  Python, PHP, C, and Flex/Actionscript are all languages that I understand well enough, and respect, but which I don’t use overmuch because of the alternatives.  Although I do use PHP a fair bit, I don’t do anything fancy with it, I mean.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s all about efficiency.  As a one-man programming team, I’m wicked fast at programming in my preferred languages.  I can put together complicated programs with great architecture, using iterative design methods, and really come out ahead of the game.  I’ve been doing that for 7 years now, and having tasted that awesome workflow process there’s just not much incentive for me to step away from that process.  I’d love to support other platforms, but it’s not worth my putting out 1/2 to 1/3 as many games, or taking 2x to 3x as long to create games anyway.  The Mono/WINE support will be along before I’d finish a project in C++, anyway, I suspect, haha.</p>

<p>No better language than C#, in my opinion – except perhaps T-SQL.  We could argue semantics all day, but in the end I’m a C# programmer and that’s what I work in.  Java is pretty cool, certain things about their libraries and performance excepted from past experience, but I really can’t stand (for example) C++.  If it makes you feel any better, I can’t stand VB&lt; either. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Hey Mopar, thanks for the warm welcome, and I’m glad the game looks intersting to you. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  As Unhandled’s link shows, we’ve had players explore the WINE side of things with the game, and the results aren’t good at the moment just because of the .NET 3.5 (lack of) support between them and Mono, etc.  So hopefully as that progresses, Linux support will become a real thing.  For people on the Mac, both Boot Camp and VMWare work <span class="bbcode-i">really </span>well with the game, but I have yet to hear of anyone getting it running on Linux.</p>
<p>I have used Linux off and on over the years (mostly Red Hat and Mandrake, even managing a few Linux Bind servers and file servers that I convinced my company to put in instead of Windows boxes years back), so I’d certainly love to see that platform able to run the game.  Just waiting on WINE/Mono, for now…</p>
