Woman accused of having sex with boy, 14
The Camano Island woman reportedly moved to the Midwest to be nearer the boy.

A Camano Island woman accused of having sex with a 14-year-old boy she met over the Internet was arrested Monday when she moved to the Midwest to live closer to him.

Police found Julie Ann Welborn, 38, at a Red Roof Inn in Jackson Township, about 50 miles south of Cleveland. A U-Haul truck containing her belongings was parked outside.

She faces charges in Massillon Municipal Court of unlawful sex with a minor and using telecommunications to solicit sex from a minor. She was being held Wednesday in Stark County Jail on $500,000 bail.

Welborn and the 14-year-old boy met through an online role-playing game called RuneScape, a game played by more than 100,000 people, according to its Web site.

The boy was 12 when they first made contact online a little more than a year ago.

Welborn allegedly had sex with the boy in October when she traveled to Ohio to meet him in person.
