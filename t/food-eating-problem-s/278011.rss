    <title>Food eating problem :S</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/food-eating-problem-s/278011</link>
    <description>Whenever i eat any food, manta, shark etc.. and i&#39;m on a Mod (playerRights 1) or Admin/Owner (playerRights 2), it works.. heals and disappears, and says i eat it. Like it&#39;s meant too.

However, if i&#39;m on a character with playerRights 0, my food doesnt work. I can eat any type of food, it does nothing. No heal, disappear, emote, nothing.

What the hell? :P 

I really need help!! this basically means people can&#39;t play my server unless i make everyone a mod!!

Example:

[code]public boolean buryBones(int fromSlot)
	{
		if (playerItemsN[fromSlot]!=1 || playerItems[fromSlot] &lt; 1)
		{
			return false;
		}
		int buryItem = playerItems[fromSlot];
		int buryXP = 0;
                int addHerb = 0;
		int myHP = playerLevel[playerHitpoints];
		if ((buryItem-1) == 379) 
                {
                	if(myHP &lt;= 99)
			{               
				heal = 12;
                                hitDiff = -heal;
                                myHP += heal;
				updateRequired = true;
				hitUpdateRequired = true;
                                sendMessage(&quot;You eat the lobster, it heals 12 hitpoints.&quot;);
                                setAnimation(829);
			}[/code]

This piece of code doesn&#39;t seem to initialise at all.. I&#39;ve tested it and on a non-ranked character, it doesn&#39;t initialise..

There&#39;s also:

[code]		} else if (healing[1] &gt; 0) 
		{
                        setAnimation(829);
			healing[0] = 1;
			healing[4] = Item;
                        healing();
		}
                      return true;[/code]

That&#39;s the animation of eating that works if a ranked player eats.. but where does that go to activate the food?? lol

Please help if you can, sorry if this is complicated :S</description>
