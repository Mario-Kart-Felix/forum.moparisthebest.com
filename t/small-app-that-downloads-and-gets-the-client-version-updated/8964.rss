    <title>Small app that downloads and gets the client version. (Updated)</title>

    <description>Version finder now updates itself, to show how easy and powerful bcel is to directly change classes, and save them. Very useful for bots used in RS to update themselves, you write your code once, let the bot change and write what needs to be updated itself after a RS update!

Its left at the previous RS version, so the first time you run it, it will say RS has been updated, say its saving its updated self, and the current version of RS. The next time you run it, it will just say the version of RS (Until the next time RS updates...)

The downloader can be used to download any file off a url. First parameter is where to save it, and the filename. Second is the url to download from. Defaults to getting runescape.jar if ran with no arugements.
bcel.jar and regexp.jar is included, as they are required and not sure how many people would have it. Classes and source is included. 

Intended as examples for people that like to look, and be able to figure out what is being done. 

Tried to make it simplistic to understand, and used the most basic classes. All heavily commented. All java.

Three classes, as the main program is depenant upon the other two, but the downloader can be ran standalone, and the version finder can be used in a different app, just give it the client class. Up to the user to put in a getter method if they would like to integrate into something else to determine if there has been a update. Just takes one method added that returns the variable...</description>

              <p>Well what I posted is if its 503 || 765 || &lt; 422 || &gt; 800 it breaks, to get the next instruction that was found from the iterator</p>
<p>I have already changed it, just not posted. It keeps the current known version, checks for it, if it fails, then it increases the versoin to check for the next one, and recursively calls itsleft.</p>
<p>If the version increases from what is known, it it changes the  method for its own class, so the sipush instruction initilizing the knownVersion variable is set to the current version, and saves the class back to disk. So its set to the current version is changed again by jagex.</p>
<p>Less breakable, and the 503, 765 versions wont matter, and the extra useless parameter would have to be the previous versoin it knows about to break it. Othrwise it wont be affected and correctly id the version.</p>
<p>No idea why they would bother breaking something getting the version number on purpose, but assume the worst.</p>
<p>What I do myself, I look for a change in what it should be, if it is, update to whatever it changed to, version doesnt matter.</p>

              <p>Version finder now updates itself, to show how easy and powerful bcel is to directly change classes, and save them. Very useful for bots used in RS to update themselves, you write your code once, let the bot change and write what needs to be updated itself after a RS update!</p>
<p>Its left at the previous RS version, so the first time you run it, it will say RS has been updated, say its saving its updated self, and the current version of RS. The next time you run it, it will just say the version of RS (Until the next time RS updates…)</p>
<p>The downloader can be used to download any file off a url. First parameter is where to save it, and the filename. Second is the url to download from. Defaults to getting runescape.jar if ran with no arugements.<br>
bcel.jar and regexp.jar is included, as they are required and not sure how many people would have it. Classes and source is included.</p>
<p>Intended as examples for people that like to look, and be able to figure out what is being done.</p>
<p>Tried to make it simplistic to understand, and used the most basic classes. All heavily commented. All java.</p>
<p>Three classes, as the main program is depenant upon the other two, but the downloader can be ran standalone, and the version finder can be used in a different app, just give it the client class. Up to the user to put in a getter method if they would like to integrate into something else to determine if there has been a update. Just takes one method added that returns the variable…</p>
