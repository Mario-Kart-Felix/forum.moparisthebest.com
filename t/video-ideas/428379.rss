    <description>Well My mom recently got me a Video camera for christmas
since I told her I wanted to do business in video production
I want to help her out, My family is very small: Just me and my mom...
by you know take part earning life savings
One of my youtube accounts reached enough views and youtube sent me a message telling me to apply for Yt partnership
But I don&#39;t want to do it with that account, is because it has all anime videos and music videos of anime
I want to do funny videos or videos with great ideas

Can anyone give some suggestions? For someone with a camera</description>

              <p>I suggest making a new channel that has a good name. Not names like “OmGNooBSkITSH”. Make it like “Fred” or “Smosh”. Something simple that people can easily memorize. You might want to make skits with your friends. You can also make mini movies. You’re videos should be original. Don’t make stuff like famous Youtubers make. Sorry if you didn’t understrand anything. It’s 12 PM and I can’t think straight.</p>

              <p>If you do decide to get partnership on that anime channel, don’t do it yet.  Wait until it has A LOT of subs/views.  Youtube offered me partnership because one of my videos hit 150k + Views in a couple weeks, but I only had about 100 subs so they declined me.</p>
<p>Anyway, to answer your question;  My cousin’s and I make a lot of videos for fun.  They don’t get many views, but they’re fun to make.  We get our ideas by just things that randomly happen to us, or sometimes base it off another show/movie we’ve seen. We don’t ever actually write a script, just get a basic idea and improv the whole thing.  Then cut out parts where we’re laughing and stuff.  (Example: My cousin, Tyler, was trying to say he gained some weight for football, but he said, “I have grained some weight”.  And we made a 4 minute long video about “Graining” weight.  So, if you actually plan on doing Youtube for a job, you probably shouldn’t do what we do as my cousin’s channel where we upload all of these videos, she has 130 uploads and 20 subscribers.  You should plan them out more.  (Or just have a different sense of humor than us).</p>
<p>NOTE: I won’t be offended if this is tl;dr.  I rambled a bit</p>
