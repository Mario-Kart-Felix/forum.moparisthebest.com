    <title>Some random thing I wrote</title>

    <description>HI, I&#39;M GEORGE ZIMMER, FOUNDER AND CEO OF MEN&#39;S WAREHOUSE. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT AN ORCHESTRA DIRECTOR WHO AT A CONCERTS DECIDED TO NOT WEAR ONE OF MY INCREDIBLY DAPPER SUITS. THE CONCERT BEGAN, AND HE STARTED WAVING HIS BATON. AT THAT TIME I DECIDED TO GET MY VENGANCE. LIKE BATMAN AFTER STICKING HIS NOCTURNAL NIGHTLIGHT IN CATWOMAN&#39;S CORNUCOPIA I SWOOPED DOWN FROM THE LIGHTING AND GRABBED THE BATON WITH ONE OF MY INCREDIBLY MANLY HANDS. I YANKED IT OUT OF HIS HANDS LIKE A LOLI TAKING CANDY FROM THE HANDS OF A PEDO AND I PROCEEDED TO SHOVE IT INTO HIS RENEGADE RECTUM. HE BENT OVER IN PAIN AND I PROCEEDED TO SNAP THE BATON WHILE IT WAS INSIDE OF HIM, MAKING A PORTION PENETRATE HIS STOMACH. AT THAT POINT, I PULLED OUT MY PELVIC PALADIN AND SHOVED IT THROUGH THE HOLE IN HIS STOMACH. AFTER SEVERAL TYRANNASAURICAL THRUSTS, I DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO START A NEW GREAT FLOOD. THE DISCIPLE MARK WAS TAKING NOTES, AND HIS EYES OPENED AT THE SIGHT OF ME UNLEASHING MY BOISTERIOUS BOY BATTER INTO THE DIRECTOR&#39;S STOMACH. IT OVERFLOWED AND COVERED THE WORLD IN MY MANLY MUFFIN MIXTURE FOR 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS, UNTIL GOD DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO COME DOWN AND GET A PIECE OF IT FOR HIMSELF. HE ATE IT ALL UP, AND THE WORLD WENT BACK TO NORMAL. THE END.</description>
