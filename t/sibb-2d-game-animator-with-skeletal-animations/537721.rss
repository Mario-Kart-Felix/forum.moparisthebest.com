    <title>Sibb -- 2D game/animator with skeletal animations</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sibb-2d-game-animator-with-skeletal-animations/537721</link>
    <description>So this is a 2D game I&#39;ve been working on for quite some time. It was made entirely from scratch, no game engines were used. The only resources currently in use are the java library and netty for networking. 
A lot of the aspects of it were inspired by various games, most notably Baten Kaitos, Final Fantasy, and Maplestory.

The combat/fighting system will be as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;While traveling through areas, there will be monsters spawning on the maps. The maps are very maplestory-esque.
If a player runs into one of these monsters, a battle will ensue -- however, it will transition to a battle map for fighting where there will be several monsters to fight.
Player health will be a set amount that will not regenerate inside or outside of battle. Although, there will be different character types of course -- healer, fighter, mage. Healers will be able to heal (obviously), however all of the character types will be able to use items on one another for healing. This idea comes from a yu-gi-oh turn-based RTS.
The combat system is, however, [b]not[/b] turn-based. It will be free-style, similar to maplestory. This makes for the best multiplayer experiences in my opinion.
Players will have a wide variety of skills at their disposal, similar to many modern RPGs. It will not simply be click and attack as that is very dull.
Upon completion of the battle, the player(s) will be sent back to the map and location in the map where the battle first began, and the monster on that map will disappear.
Monsters will only respawn when all of the monsters on the map have been beaten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anyway, I haven&#39;t gotten incredibly far in the development yet -- still not even an alpha, really. The framework is made for the most part, though, so content creation isn&#39;t too far off.

Along with this game comes a 2d sketetal animator. Because I plan on having a lot of characters that I don&#39;t want to individually animate or create sprite sheets for, as well as a lot of weapons, I&#39;m creating a program to animate skeletons and attach images to the skeleton. An example of this is in this video, in the first 20 seconds or so: 
[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hRFEYFfDFs[/youtube]
I don&#39;t imagine mine will be quite as beautiful, but I do think it will be just as functional.

Anyway, here&#39;s a list of what is completed in each portion:

</aside>
<p>Much better performance? The performance would be identical, the only difference would be the amount of code I’m required to write. I can rely on Netty to not have any issues whereas with NIO I’d have to spend time tweaking and perfecting the base. And, unless I were to do it perfectly, NIO would not have the same scalability as Netty; a large number of users would not necessarily be an issue, but it would not be handled as well.</p>
