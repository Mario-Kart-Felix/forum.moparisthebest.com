    <title>PC Dilemma (New one or Old One)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pc-dilemma-new-one-or-old-one/399841</link>
    <description>So this is an old computer, i got it in 2003, this was the first new computer i got, ( i know its not good). And this is the only Desktop i have, i rarely find it useful, since i mostly use my Laptop, so this summer i want to use my Desktop, but the problem is its too slow...i reformatted it and still slow, i don&#39;t know if i should build a new comp or upgrade this one, i mean its Dvd driver is only few months old expect for that all of its are old and the case is fine. 

So i am not so sure what to do, i want to keep cost minimal, but have a computer that can support windows 7 and Debian as dual boot. I have limited knowledge with computer hardware so please help..attached is the specification of the computer, i wouldn&#39;t mind replacing everything (expect case, cause its fine i think, and DVD drive since its pretty much new).

My goal at least 100gb+ hard rive and at least , and 2gb+ram (even 1gb is ok i guess), manily used for programming, youtube surfing, email, word processing and definitely [b]not gaming[/b] . thanks you in advance.

<p>What do you mean by ‘objective reviews’?

Other people have had other experiences, it doesn’t make any of them more objective than the other ones.<br>

It’s not arguing, they are both objective reviews, though they conflict.  Obviously this would lead someone to realize that all manufacturers make some number of bad drives.</p>

              <p>Batteries are cheap. Like they give a fuck about a battery. Replacing an entire laptop is a different thing all together though. Also depends where you are, I am specifically talking about HP in the UK.</p>
<p>I agree Speljohan but like I said, no review is without bias. You either listen to other’s or you don’t. I can write a review and call it objective but here we are on the internet you have no idea what my motives for writing that review were, who paid me, what experience i have with other manufacturers etc etc.</p>
<p>Statistics could show you the brand with least risk involved but statistics are just statistics and individual cases can be completely different. That’s not to say people shouldn’t ask for others opinions though, everything you ever do is because people taught you or you learned to do it that way. Doesn’t mean it’s the best, just means that’s your way <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>For example I usually read Tomshardware and engadget for reviews but I’d be foolish to say their isn’t bias. Despite them both being pretty good at benchmarking and reviewing products.</p>

Incidentally this thread is so full of bias it isnt even funny. It’s just like the HDD-discussion, if you listen to people here you won’t be able to get ANY PC at all.<br>

<p>Can’t really speak without bias as everyone speaks from experience, which is their own personal bias. I can’t see how no bias is better as no bias means purely going off specs which we all know is a terrible idea. Build quality matters. Even when building your own the parts you buy need to come from somewhere with a decent reputation and decent warranty. Otherwise you risk compromising the whole machine. Obviously you can never be certain and for that reason bias sucks. Blame the capitalist world we live in  :rolleyes:[/quote]Listening to the people whining in this thread is a horrible idea though. Look at objective reviews for more accurate info, no single brand is bad, they all have pcs that arent good.</p>

<p>You could build a computer for a fairly cheap price (cheaper than buying a new computer). I would recommend looking on <a href="http://www.newegg.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.newegg.com</a><br>
