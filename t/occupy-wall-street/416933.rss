              <blockquote>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To understand how and why protest like this can work, you need some concrete and proven examples from the past. Let’s start with the most hopeless and wildly idealistic cause – and see how it won. The first ever attempt to hold a Gay Pride rally in Trafalgar Square was in 1965. Two dozen people turned up – and they were mostly beaten by the police and arrested. Gay people were imprisoned for having sex, and even the most compassionate defense of gay people offered in public life was that they should be pitied for being mentally ill.
<p>Imagine if you had stood in Trafalgar Square that day and told those two dozen brave men and women: “Forty-five years from now, they will stop the traffic in Central London for a Gay Pride parade on this very spot, and it will be attended by hundreds of thousands of people. There will be married gay couples, and representatives of every political party, and openly gay soldiers and government ministers and huge numbers of straight supporters – and it will be the homophobes who are regarded as freaks.” It would have seemed like a preposterous statement of science fiction. But it happened. It happened in one lifetime. Why? Not because the people in power spontaneously realized that millennia of persecuting gay people had been wrong, but because determined ordinary citizens banded together and demanded justice.</p>

<p>They’ve been pretty successful in getting thousands of angry people on the streets. The protests have spread far beyond Wall Street and New York.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of issues mixed in I see. From the class war where the majority of Americans have seen their incomes stagnate in the past 30 years while the incomes of the rich have sky-rocketed, to alarm about the corporate lobbying legalised-bribery of American democracy, to much of American public wealth being wasted on foreign wars rather than investment at home, to environmental concerns where corperations can dump pollution that we all have to pay for.</p>
<p>A video from a few days ago capturing a protest and how Wall Street champagne-swillers stand on balcony and laugh at protesters…<br>

<p>Slightly more in-depth analysis from the RT news channel<br>

<p>This news report from a few days ago shows how yahoo email were censoring all outgoing messages with the phrase <span class="bbcode-i"><a href="https://occupywallst.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://occupywallst.org/</a></span><br>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/frell">@Frell</a>, ‘entrepreneurs’ do vastly less than Reaganomics would lead you to believe. Virtually all of the actual work is done by working men and women. They who actually build roads, structures, railways, computers. They fix things, clean, protect, drive and operate.<br>
Your ‘entrepreneur’ rich bankers get an income merely for moving money around on various spreadsheets. They get money simply for being already rich. Most of them are only rich due to various kinds of inheritance (parents paid for private schools, college, found them a job with rich friends)</p>
<p>iirc Lothy and Pwnd are usually against this sort of thing (protesting, left wing politics) so I’d like to read their view on the matter.</p>
