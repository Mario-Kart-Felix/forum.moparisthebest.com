    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m looking for a team of talented individuals to develop a server source for the [b]#TBD[/b] revision. The purpose of assembling such a team is to create a source to collect the server status money offer posted by MITB. We&#39;re only looking for SERVER DEVELOPERS.

Want to be apart of a great project just for the notoriety? Are you someone who has great potential and would like to show Moparscape what you can do? Well this is your place.

You MUST have at minimum these prerequisites:

[ul][li]Great communication skills[/li]
[li]2 - 4 years of java experience
[list]
[li]Concurrency basics (synchronization blocks, locks, methods)[/li]
[li]Conventions knowledge[/li]
[li]Application of simple computer science algorithms[/li]
[/list]
[/li]
[li]Basic OOP design pattern knowledge[/li]
[li]Experience in ONE or more scripting languages[/li]
[li]Ability to learn in a fast paced environment[/li]
[li]Basic RSPS protocol knowledge[/li]
[li]Proper english, and documentation knowledge[/li][/ul]
 
The first stage of the project is refactoring a client and mapping out all the information found in documents before completely mapping out a server on paper before it is created.

If you are interested in this project leave a post, and I will get back to those of you I&#39;m interested in.</description>
