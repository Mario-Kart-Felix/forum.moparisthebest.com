    <title>2 step crash</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-step-crash/285601</link>
    <description>I&#39;m going to make this as simple as possible.
I open ANY client.
I take 1 step.
I take 2nd step it closes.
Can you help me.

I would say that if i was a noob.

Since i&#39;m a semi-noob i&#39;m going to say this
Any DOWNLOADED cleint i use crashes if i take two steps. the first step is fine though.
If i use moparscape webclient i press log in and then nothing happens it just says Loading please wait....
SILAB is the only client that works. it only works on the webclient though not the downloded.
oh just kidding AZN cheat client works too. nothing else</description>

Me and you both Im the exactly the same way literally every bit ofwhat you say is what I’m going  through! It’s amazing how it happeneded and Ive put 3 threads up in 3 different topics/ And nothing no answer. I even uploaded a thing on youtube no ocmments:/ Good thing is I know Im not the only one with this particular crash. I also can use silabs client but its laggy and gay. I cant play my servers and it gets very tiring maybe we will find the help we need soon. Until then stick with me. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>did you try to make your server compatible with bluurs client. i did that once and afterwords any time i tried to get on without bluurs client i disconected after a couple of steps. if you did all you have to do is delete the addition you needed for bluurs.</p>
