    <title>[solved]Ruby attributes reader/writer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solved-ruby-attributes-reader-writer/436641</link>
    <description>[s]Learning Ruby atm. But for some odd reason i just don&#39;t understand attribute readers and writers. What they do and how to call them. 
This is my class.
[code=ruby]
#A class for using attribute readers and writers.
class Dog

#An attribute reader for the dog&#39;s name.
attr_reader :name
#An attribute writer for the dog&#39;s name.
attr_writer :name

  #Initializes the dog object.
  def initialize
    @name = &quot;Dick&quot;
  end

#The class&#39; end.
end

dog = Dog.new

#Now I want to get the dog&#39;s name. How the fuck am I supposed to do that??
puts dog:name #?
puts dog.@name #?

[/code]

[s]Obviously I don&#39;t understand the big picture of attribute readers/writers. Explain pl0x
By the way. Ruby is my second language. My first is Java, so that&#39;s why I&#39;m not familiar with this concept.[/s]

Nevermind. Got it. I feel stupid right now.</description>
