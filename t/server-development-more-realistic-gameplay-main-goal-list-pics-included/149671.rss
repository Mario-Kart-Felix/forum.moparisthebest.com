    <description>PLEASE READ ALL BELOW:

This is the development thread for my RuneScape private server. My goal with this is to not create a generic server, but make it closer to the actual game, while still making it fun. What I mean by this is that you won&#39;t be able to attack something and instantly get 10 attack, or go to a ::shop place and buy dragon armor. 

On this thread you will see a TO DO list, along with pictures of my progress. There will also be ideas that I have not completely confirmed yet, and the possibility of a &#39;coder recruiting list&#39;, depending on my need of help. At the moment, I am coding this server by myself, with only the help of other servers (to search for missing voids etc.), and the help section. As a forewarning, updates may be slow. There is the possibility that with everything going on in my life, the development of my server will be halted for a week, or longer. Please be patient with me, as I have highschool 5 days a week, cross country meets weekly, and homework on a regular basis. With all of that said, I will begin my progress report

LEGEND:
:) == COMPLETED!
:confused: == IN PROGRESS!
:( == TO DO!

:confused: - Remove all object/case methods of training (dummies basically). Reduce EXP given from normal combat to ~50 + (skill level * 1.5)
:) - Add in working DragonFire Shield special (Dragon breath, max damage is depending on current health level.)

Due to the shield glitching out as above ^, I am not full finished, but here&#39;s the fire:
[img]http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/847/firemt4.png[/img]
it is pretty much done, Just a little bit of fix up
:( - Full X-bow specials, enchanted bolts only. I&#39;m going to skip out on making regular bolts and an enchantment spell..
:confused: - Realistic pking, lots of voids and cases to fix up. I want people to have the same &#39;ecstasy&#39; rush as in RS.
:( - Prayer, protect prayers with head icons (serverside)
:confused: - Deleting MOST noncombat skills, including the icons. Then working hella hard on creating FULL versions of the ones I keep. (Mining, RCing, Farming (possibly), woodcutting, fishing, cooking)
[img]http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/9148/statsrm0.png[/img]
theres the list cleaned out. Still have to clean out the actual skill voids.
:) - No shops that sell random rare items. Only realistic shops, that will buy the stuff you get from noncombat skills.
:) - Very few commands, more buttons. Teleports will not take any magic level, but will involve runes.
No screens of this yet.
:( - Making more items untradeable
-NOTE: I have made some untradeable, such as random event clothing, etc.
:confused: - Cluescrolls, fairly simplified though.
:confused: - Random voids to define, fixing simple errors such as not facing the enemy, range gfx, etc.
:( - Better savegamehandler
:( - Autoban for certain abuse (such as massing)
:( - Full spell book, including curse and bind etc.
:( - Fence in a portion of runescape to use for the whole server (the fucking map is too big for 30 players. I want people to have competition in the mining areas and such.
:( - Creating a better economy, so people do actual trading more (like varrock world 1). The main goal here is to make all items above rune (excluding dragon weapons) only availiable by killing npc&#39;s, or making them yourself.
:confused: - Tutorial island
-pics to come! ;D

I realize that all of the goals are in the &#39;to do&#39; status, although I have completed a few of them. I am just awaiting when I have time to update and screenshot. This page could take a long time to load once pics are abundant.

              <p>Well my server is fucked. After removing a few commands/changing it so all teleport commands are owner only, the majority of the commands no do not work. They don’t freeze the server, they just do nothing. I’m talking the majority of the kick/ban commands, all frame testing, etc. I have tried undoing all that I did, (notepad ++), with no luck. Major setback <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>EDIT: 4 hours of work. fixed commands. No clue what the hell was happening, but it’s fixed now.</p>
