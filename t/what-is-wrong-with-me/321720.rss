    <title>What is wrong with me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-wrong-with-me/321720</link>
    <description>I quit smoking marijuana a few weeks ago and it had always helped me relax. I have always had minor anxiety, but right now I have not been able to stop this anxiety attack and I can&#39;t stop shaking. I don&#39;t know what is causing this, and I almost just strangled my sister to death because she started yelling. My dad takes pills for anxiety and I don&#39;t know if this is going to go away. Right now im trying to listen to music to calm down and it isn&#39;t working.

Edit: Yeah thanks Daniel and Jme, I haven&#39;t had another since Christmas Eve so it&#39;s fine for now. If it happens again I&#39;ll probably just see a doctor.</description>

              <p>Research anxiety and figure out which disorder you probably have if any. If it’s not clear cut then go see a psychologist.</p>
<p>I have panic disorder and I keep away from caffeine and cigarettes, and cut down on alcohol. I take potassium supplements and they help. Realize that panic attacks are only so scary because they are different from the norm. You aren’t scared of a runny nose right? The adrenaline rush, the pounding heart, hot and cold flashes, shaking etc are all just symptoms like a cough or something. Once I realized that it helped a shitload.</p>
<p>It also might stop once you get the weed out of your system.</p>
