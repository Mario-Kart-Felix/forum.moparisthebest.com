You didn’t explain your question? However, seeing as this is his thread. I don’t even think it matters, feel free to create another thread though? :D[/quote]<br>

<p>You don’t have to be mean to him. Some people are new, and I’m sure you were new as well. Just be patient with the slow learners. -.-</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Others</span>: I don’t know what’s hard to understand or comprehend.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@I</span> will pwn u: You have to obtain Winrar. Then you can extract the downloaded files and this will leave a folder. Click on the folder and go to the server files for example and click run. An CMD prompt should appear and something about the server being online or something.</p>
