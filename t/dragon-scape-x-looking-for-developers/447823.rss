    <title>Dragon Scape X (Looking for developers)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dragon-scape-x-looking-for-developers/447823</link>
    <description>Hello, I think I should rather introduce myself first since it&#39;s the first time I ever request something on here.
So I&#39;am Jake, currently hosting Dragon Scape X which is basically 667/711, I have studied a little bit of Java, and I know the basics about setting up a private server, I have previously worked with almost all the past runescape revisions and decided to take a step ahead of me.
So all I&#39;m requesting is a couple of people who have experience in the 667/700+ revisions who can help me make something out of this server, and hopefully it will be something good.
So if anyone&#39;s interested, please leave me a comment.
The website for the server is http://dragonscapex.wix.com/rune
Just incase you want to have a look at it and try the server for yourself.
Thank you very much.</description>
