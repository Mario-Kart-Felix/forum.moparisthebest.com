    <description>Hello Moparscape Community!

I am new to rsps, and am working on my first one.

I am using this client/server : [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,443234.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,443234.0.html[/url]

I followed the instructions where it said to edit the &quot;server = &quot; line, and compiled the client, then opened the server and ran the client and got &quot;error connecting to server&quot;.

Then I found a line in the server.java file that said something like &quot;if playerrights = 2 then connect to server ___ &quot; so I changed the original server = back to default and changed this new one to my server. This worked for me, but i tried to run the client on my other computer and it failed! 

When I changed both server codes to mine nothing worked.

Help ?  :confused:</description>

              <p>Ok, basically the problem is that no other computer than my own can use the client while the server is running.</p>
<p>So what I’m saying is…</p>
<p>The computer running the server is the only one that the client will work on! I need it so that other people can play it!</p>
