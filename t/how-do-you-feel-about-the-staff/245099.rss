    <title>How do you feel about the Staff?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-feel-about-the-staff/245099</link>
    <description>I would just like to know, people have been complaining for the past two days now. But no one has really given a valid reason as to why they dislike them. I&#39;ve heard some about how they aren&#39;t objectional enough, and they struggle with elitism. And those are the only two good reasons to be angry with some of the staff members. But what else? I&#39;d just like to know why you all are so fixated with the administration and moderation of these forums. 

On a side note:
I&#39;d just like to say that I myself have complained about the staff, on multiple occasions. And I&#39;ve found recently, that it is just not worth it. I supported xxlegitxx back when he was around opposing Greeny, and a lot of good that did. He ended up leaving because nothing could be done. And I found that I liked Greeny as a Staff Member, mainly because he is very objectional. He struggles a bit with elitism I think. But he does a very successful job as a Moderator. That&#39;s why I supported him becoming a Global Moderator (Which obviously hasn&#39;t happened yet.) I also had issues with Tico recently, where I wasn&#39;t very sure of his ability to moderate, and with his maturity, but he has more than proved to me that he can moderate.

I think there are some issues with people perception of the staff, and not of the staff itself. People just don&#39;t want to have to fix themselves, because they don&#39;t think they&#39;re in the wrong. It&#39;s obvious that the staff are doing the very best job they can under extreme strain. I myself love to flame people, I absolutely adore it. But when I&#39;m punished I take it as a personal attack towards me, which shouldn&#39;t be the case. Who here actually thinks they have been wronged, that the staff didn&#39;t operate within the guidelines set before them? I highly doubt anyone here can name one.

Just an idea to possibly fix this fucked up community. It is very radical, and I&#39;m sure some people will tell me to shut my damn mouth. But I think it may be exactly what we need. If we all remember, before the separation of Moparscape from Moparisthebest. The community was in pretty good standing, except for the huge amount of nonsensical spam everywhere, and the fuckwits all over the place. It was very lively, and people loved the community. I suggest that they be returned to the way they were, that a category be made on this site, and move all the boards over here. But then introduce a requirement before members can post anywhere else on these forums. They must be deemed worthy to post on the other boards by a board of judges. 

It basically would be like the people post in a board for validation by a judge on the board, somebody quickly looks over their old posts and deems them worthy to be a regular on mitb. If somebody who comes here looking for help in another area, not for private servers they can immediately post in the validation board. That would pretty much give mitb a stream of new members on a regular basis, hopefully somewhat more intelligent that moparscapers. It would also give the mitb community a chance to grow, and liven up a bit.

I have pretty much gone off of course from my initial topic, but I think it was worth it.</description>

              <p>Just to clear things up a bit, the conflicts with the staff we’re talking about here don’t really have anything to do with cheating; the arguments most people have with the staff aren’t over issues like bot releases, withholding code, real issues, etc… The conflicts are about stupid pointless shit. So when people talk about their feelings toward the staff, I wonder what they are talking about.</p>
<p>Here’s an idea, if you don’t like the way things are, learn some code and contribute and don’t act like a total dumbass and you’ll probably get promoted to staff. Hey, if Mrs. Silabsoft could do it, you can do it ;). <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

True which makes me think I wouldn’t want to be a global mod, due to the fact I’ve visited <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a> about 5 times in the two and a half years I’ve been here.</p>

<p>Agreed about not doing their job, but I think most do it over there. I know post reports have to be done and still I’m sure they check around the forums whenever they can. Buttttt what I am saying is that the gmods are obviously not going to be active over there because there isn’t much for them to say if they aren’t interested in pservers.</p>

<p>Pretty much all of the global moderators have no interest in private servers, because they are all from these sides of the forums. Moparscape was just a seperation to keep all that garbage away from this site. This is why none of them visit very actively. That being said I know they still do go through post reports and stuff. And there’s not much of a selection over there for moparscape mods so that doesn’t help. I think those forums are just screwed forever it’s too much of a kiddie playground. im just rambling off high again[/quote]</p>
