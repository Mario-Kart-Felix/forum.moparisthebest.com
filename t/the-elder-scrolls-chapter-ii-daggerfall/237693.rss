    <title>The Elder Scrolls Chapter II: Daggerfall</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-elder-scrolls-chapter-ii-daggerfall/237693</link>
    <description>This is the best rpg you will ever play. Perhaps even the best game you will ever play.
It is rare now - often selling for well over $100, so [url=http://tinyurl.com/5gv35p]here[/url] is an abandonware link. You will need Dosbox from http://dosbox.com/ to play.
If you&#39;ve ever played any of the other Elder Scrolls games, you&#39;ll be pretty comfortable with the style of play/format of this game. Beware, though - if you were one of the people who likes to play without fast travel, you really shouldn&#39;t try that in Daggerfall. Morrowind was 6 sq miles, Oblivion was 16, Daggerfall is 63,125. Anyways, I&#39;ll get on to the story/background/etc.
You are called to the Emperor&#39;s chambers [more details are revealed under your characters history], and are tasked with doing two things in the Iliac Bay region [High Rock + Hammerfell]: Solve King Lysandus of Daggerfall&#39;s murder, and destroy a letter meant for the Queen of Daggerfall. However, one of the best parts about this game is that the main quest is completely optional, and that there are over 200 randomly generated quests you can take instead. It&#39;s a very open game - you can play it as many different types of character, and even create your own. You can also custom build spells + items. I&#39;ve been playing it for a few months, and just decided to try the main story today.
Probably the hardest part of the game are the dungeons. I&#39;ve spent hours navigating a single dungeon trying to find my task. There are, however, easier ways to do it than my way.

Anyways, this post isn&#39;t very good, it&#39;s only meant to get you to play the game.
Remember:
1) Game - [url=http://tinyurl.com/5gv35p]here[/url]
2) DosBox - http://dosbox.com/
3) Daggerfall Website, with lots of links/useful information - http://www.svatopluk.com
Get playing!</description>
