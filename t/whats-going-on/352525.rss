    <description>hey everyone,
kk ive got the source and a client, everything works fine when i log in with the ip 127.0.0.1 but i want to be able to log in with the ip that i made in the no-ip thing which is crisispkz.no-ip.org. ive made that ip and everything, thats all good. ive done the portforwarding, and ive allowed the port thing through my firewall and everything. but i still cant log on with the ip that ive made? the no-ip thing is running, says everything is fine. but when i got to canyouseeme.org, it says it cant see through my ports or whatever, the connection was refused. whats going on? what did i do wrong?
All help appreciated.</description>
