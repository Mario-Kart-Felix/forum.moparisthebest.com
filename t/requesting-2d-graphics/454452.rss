    <title>Requesting 2D Graphics?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/requesting-2d-graphics/454452</link>
    <description>Okay so I have previously posted a question about what&#39;s going on with my .JAR for my Server. 
It is working just fine for me. But when I send it out to a friend. It stops at about 40% and says requesting 2D Graphics.
Anyone have any idea on how to fix this or what&#39;s wrong?</description>
