    <description>Can someone help me fix the auto talker on my client? The frame and everything pops up, it types what text I put in but it doesn&#39;t actually say the text. When it says in the text, if I enter &quot;hi&quot; then another window pops up and says how many times would you want to loop it I put in something like 10 but it typed the text &quot;hi&quot; but it is left to where I can still edit it. I want the auto talker to type the text and press enter so that everyone can see the text. Can anyone help me please =)</description>
