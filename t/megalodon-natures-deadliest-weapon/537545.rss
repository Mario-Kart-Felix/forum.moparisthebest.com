    <description>The Megalodon shark is perhaps natures deadliest weapon created to date. A 40-60 foot shark at one time recorded to hit 100 feet.

A Megalodon Jaw Fossil;

Now it is said that these animals went extinct over 2 million years ago, due to cold climate change and scarce food source. However, a branch of pigmy whale, were thought to have been extinct around the same time, until; 

http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2012/1219/Extinct-whale-found-Odd-looking-pygmy-whale-traced-back-2-million-years

Now, with only %5 of our oceans explored, isn&#39;t it possible that the other %95 holds something big? I personally believe somewhere out there Megalodon is still roaming the oceans. Discovery channel ran a fake documentary on megalodon, where a team investigated a boat attack in South Africa. Even though the documentary was claimed fake, they showed some evidence in there which was true. Off the shore of Hawaii, a humpback whale was found on a beach with its tail completely ripped off. No average great white has the force to do that, which leads me to believe that even if it wasn&#39;t a megalodon that did that, then what did?</description>

There is no super deadly Megalodon at the bottom of the sea drinking tea with the Kraken. It needs huge amount food and you don’t find much food at deep sea.<br>

It’s the same reason dinosaurs aren’t around today. They were too big and needed too many calories so they died off. Same thing happened to the megalodon. Large mammals exist today because their metabolic rate is slow and they don’t expend a lot of energy to eat, such as the whale shark. It is highly unlikely the megalodon still exists.</p>

It needs food. Production of food happens near the ocean surface where photosynthesis is possible. If you want to be big and eat a lot, you need to live where you can find food.[/quote]<br>

<p>Hm, true, and i get what you’re saying but How do we know there isn’t food at the bottom? The ocean keeps surprising us, we discover life forms in abyss’s that know no light at the bottom, megalodons were eating machines kinda like tiger sharks so they’ll eat anything, and I’m pretty sure majority of the ocean isn’t lifeless.

"How do we know there isn’t food at the bottom?"<br>
Because there is no food production at the bottom.</p>

              <p>Of course anything is possible but I think the chances of the megalodon still existing in the ocean is less likely than there being aquatic apes. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>How wide was the tail? A megalodon’s jaw width is only 11 ft and a hump back whale’s fluke can be 18 ft wide, ruling out even a megalodon haha. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Perhaps it was torn off from a ship’s propeller.</p>

<p>That is a deep sea angler. I know this because I once encountered an identical fish, but in a fresh-water lake. In my case it can’t be a deep sea angler, but it sure looked like one. It was quite large, had the same teeth, and a tentacle with some sort of bulb. Me and 2 others saw it swimming in the water. It was unlike anything anyone has ever seen around here.</p>

<p>Understandable, but as a shark lover I’d love for the megalodon to surface . And there have been species of sea creatures that were thought to have been  extinct longer than the megalodon , but they have surfaced . So I’m hopinh it’s still out there but, idk.</p>

<p>Now, with only %5 of our oceans explored, isn’t it possible that the other %95 holds something big? I personally believe somewhere out there Megalodon is still roaming the oceans. Discovery channel ran a fake documentary on megalodon, where a team investigated a boat attack in South Africa. Even though the documentary was claimed fake, they showed some evidence in there which was true. Off the shore of Hawaii, a humpback whale was found on a beach with its tail completely ripped off. No average great white has the force to do that, which leads me to believe that even if it wasn’t a megalodon that did that, then what did?</p>
