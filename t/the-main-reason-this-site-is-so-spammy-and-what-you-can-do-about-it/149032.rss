    <description>Look, when you&#39;re put in the position of a mod, and you read post reports on a daily basis, it becomes blatently obvious why this site is so full of crap. It&#39;s because, when someone breaks a rule, 10 million people jump on it immediately, quote it, and scream random cusswords at him. 

Guess what folks, you are just making more spam for us to clear up and other people to burn their eyes on.

Most people are using the post report system a lot now, which is great. But once you&#39;ve reported it, do not reply. If you must reply, at least make it a calm, sensible reply, explaining what the original poster has done wrong.

Moparscape as a whole will thank you for it.



MOPARSCAPE MODS: I hope I didn&#39;t tread on your turf creating a sticky here - I don&#39;t plan on keeping it long, just until it&#39;s been read a bit, then I&#39;ll delete it.</description>

<p>I will quote. People are not idiots, they are just “ignorant” in what they do, it doesn’t make them an idiot. Just by calling them that, you’re just as bad as flamming someone.</p>

Only locking or deleting helps.<br>
But if they keep reposting it it will annoy you, no spare time.<br>

<p>Agreed, but that being said the chances of a new mod are little (unless you guys have polls on it or something). Besides it takes a good community along with a good staff to keep a community like this from dieing.</p>

<p>Highly agreed. That has kept this community alive for as long as it has, but it isnt enough anymore, many people just dont care, they just want to be dumb asses.<br>

Wouldn’t work.<br>
First I wanted to become a mod also, until Iki showed me a short vid of the reports.<br>
Moparscape Mods don’t have many powers, they can only Lock/Delete and move.<br>
You will get tired when people repost it every time you lock it.<br>
Iki does it great on his own lol.<br>
Sure something like Mrq will happen<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You can never be ‘sure’ something like Mrquarter will happen again because you don’t know. People are different and may not act the same as Mrquarter did, the hard thing is, people change when they become moderator’s. That can be a good thing, and yet a bad thing. That is why I am sure they haven’t chosen another moderator. Because they are eying a few member’s and possibly monitoring the posts and seeing if they can interperte how they may act if they became a moderator.</p>
<p>Yes, that hatred against mscp on mitb is insane. Almost every single member on mitb, hates mscp. They make fun of us for knowing server java, and I ask them, what other programming language do you know? As iker’s already know’s, io9 loves to come here and be an asshole. He has warned him before and I am sure he will do it again, as well as the other moparisthebestians that choose to come here.[/quote]<br>
True, however I don’t trust it anymore.<br>
There are too many wannabe-mods thinking they can handle modding and thinking it is fun like having your own smfforfree site to abuse on people.</p>

First I wanted to become a mod also, until Iki showed me a short vid of the reports.<br>
Moparscape Mods don’t have many powers, they can only Lock/Delete and move.<br>
You will get tired when people repost it every time you lock it.<br>
Iki does it great on his own lol.<br>
Sure something like Mrq will happen[/quote]</p>
<p>You can never be ‘sure’ something like Mrquarter will happen again because you don’t know. People are different and may not act the same as Mrquarter did, the hard thing is, people change when they become moderator’s. That can be a good thing, and yet a bad thing. That is why I am sure they haven’t chosen another moderator. Because they are eying a few member’s and possibly monitoring the posts and seeing if they can interperte how they may act if they became a moderator.</p>
<p>Yes, that hatred against mscp on mitb is insane. Almost every single member on mitb, hates mscp. They make fun of us for knowing server java, and I ask them, what other programming language do you know? As iker’s already know’s, io9 loves to come here and be an asshole. He has warned him before and I am sure he will do it again, as well as the other moparisthebestians that choose to come here.</p>
