    <title>Make money on fishing and cooking?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-money-on-fishing-and-cooking/405936</link>
    <description>So right now I&#39;m trying to get my fishing level up by fishing lobs and swords/tuna.  Right now I could sell everything I fished for X amount of gp.  However if I decide to cook the food and then sell it, I will make less gp than X because cooked food is worth less than raw food and also I&#39;d burn some.  Basically, is there a way for me to sell my raw fish, then buy ingredients to cook with that will give me fast xp and more money than if I were to cook the fish?</description>

<p>Shouldn’t loose that much with sharks, in fact you could pull of making a profit now the trade limit has gone (just cooking them).</p>

<p>Raw/cooked are both 68gp, maybe try that in the GE? You wouldn’t make anything, but you wouldn’t loose anything either. Another way which I’ve quickly thought of is that you could keep the raw tuna then get the following items:</p>
<p>potato - 35gp in GE, 11gp shop price<br>
bucket of milk -  52gp in GE, 12gp shop price<br>
sweetcorn - GE 25 coins<br>
raw tuna: 68gp GE (but you’ve fished that)</p>
<p>Then you can make tuna potato, make a profit and gain cooking XP. Profit should be around 921gp per potato, and 309.5 XP all together. I’m pretty sure they sell? So you’re gaining cooking/fishing levels and making gp + pretty good XP.</p>
