              <p>The thing i have found to help the most is an ipfilter. You can find plenty of copy and paste tutorials on various websites including this one. However the good ones i cant link you to because they are on another site. But what you need is an ip filter. it only allows so many connections before it just starts rejecting. Blocking names doesnâ€™t really work because if someone uses an allgofree spammer. They can change the name.</p>
