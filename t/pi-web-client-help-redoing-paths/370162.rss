    <title>[pi] web client. help redoing paths</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-web-client-help-redoing-paths/370162</link>
    <description>i recently made a web client from tragedy pk&#39;s client and it works but there is no loading cache% screen. the screen is whiter untill cache is done loading then u get the loin screen.
and also there is no animation players and npc&#39;s are stiff and they just slide across the ground and i dont think there is gfx either. so when i attack my arms dont move and when i walk i just slide.

a friend told me it has to do with the paths i guess like c:client/anim or whatever im not sure.
but if you have never seen t pks client there is no anim folder so what do i do pleas help..</description>
