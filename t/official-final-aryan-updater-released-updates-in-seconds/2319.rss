&lt;blockquote&gt;Linked at the bottom is a tarball of our updater suite.

It&#39;s not an easy process if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing, and I made no effort to make it intuitive for the uninitiated, but it&#39;s very stable. We&#39;ve had a handful of broken rules since 347, when Kamu and I tossed it together. There is no documentation provided.

You need to deal with the deobbing process on your own; as input, the run.sh script takes two different jar files: one containing the class files which have been run through saev&#39;s deobber and ZKM, and another which contains the decompiled forms of those. You will need a publiciser transformer for the deobber, that&#39;s up to you, unless Sean releases his class. Disabling the ubfolder transformer in the deobber&#39;s run.xml will prevent the animation error from occuring, so you should do that, as well. All source files should have standard Unix newlines -- you will need to run dos2unix on the .java files if you&#39;re in win32.

Beyond that, just read the run.sh script to see the individual steps. Some of them, such as packaging the client and running middleman.pl, are not necessary for the Aryan version which most people have, but they are for the version which was just leaked. If you can&#39;t manage to understand the run.sh script, just give up now, this updater is not for you.

All of my code is being released under an implicit BSD license. Meaning you can do whatever the hell you want with it, provided you (theoretically) give credit. Since you&#39;re all 12 years old, or at least exhibit the mindsets of prepubescent little boys, I&#39;m not getting my hopes up.

Best of luck.

<blockquote>Linked at the bottom is a tarball of our updater suite.
<p>It’s not an easy process if you don’t know what you’re doing, and I made no effort to make it intuitive for the uninitiated, but it’s very stable. We’ve had a handful of broken rules since 347, when Kamu and I tossed it together. There is no documentation provided.</p>
<p>You need to deal with the deobbing process on your own; as input, the run.sh script takes two different jar files: one containing the class files which have been run through saev’s deobber and ZKM, and another which contains the decompiled forms of those. You will need a publiciser transformer for the deobber, that’s up to you, unless Sean releases his class. Disabling the ubfolder transformer in the deobber’s run.xml will prevent the animation error from occuring, so you should do that, as well. All source files should have standard Unix newlines – you will need to run dos2unix on the .java files if you’re in win32.</p>
<p>Beyond that, just read the run.sh script to see the individual steps. Some of them, such as packaging the client and running middleman.pl, are not necessary for the Aryan version which most people have, but they are for the version which was just leaked. If you can’t manage to understand the run.sh script, just give up now, this updater is not for you.</p>
<p>All of my code is being released under an implicit BSD license. Meaning you can do whatever the hell you want with it, provided you (theoretically) give credit. Since you’re all 12 years old, or at least exhibit the mindsets of prepubescent little boys, I’m not getting my hopes up.</p>
<p>Best of luck.</p>
