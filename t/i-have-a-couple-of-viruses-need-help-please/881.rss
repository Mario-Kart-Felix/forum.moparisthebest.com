    <title>I have a couple of viruses. Need help please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-a-couple-of-viruses-need-help-please/881</link>
    <description>I took a couple of screenshots of some of the problems incase anyone might know what&#39;s going on.
I tried to get onto MoparScape when I woke up this morning, and all of my batch files are inaccessible. When I logged on this morning, my Windows OneCare told me it had found viruses named &#39;onoes.exe&#39; and &#39;b.exe&#39; . It can&#39;t clean them it just quarentines them, which I see does nothing. It won&#39;t let me open up task manager or regedit either. It tells me regedit is not a valid win32 application and that another program is currently using it. It also tells me another program is currently using task mgr. It tells me the same thing with MoparScape. Does anyone know the problem and how to fix it and get rid of these damn viruses?</description>

<p>The second you turn on your computer, start pressing f8 rapidly until it asks you if you wanna go into sfae mode. Say yes. Now that your in safe mode, scan with every virus cleaner you have, and every spyware program you have.</p>

<p>So go download avg anti-virus, and ad-aware, and spybot. Trust me, scanners are much more effective in safe-mode. Take note of the viruses you had if they dont go away even after cleaning them iwth an anti virus, and search google for manual removal. You almost never have to re-format because of a virus, although sometimes you do.</p>

              <p>I took a couple of screenshots of some of the problems incase anyone might know what's going on.<br>I tried to get onto MoparScape when I woke up this morning, and all of my batch files are inaccessible. When I logged on this morning, my Windows OneCare told me it had found viruses named 'onoes.exe' and 'b.exe' . It can't clean them it just quarentines them, which I see does nothing. It won't let me open up task manager or regedit either. It tells me regedit is not a valid win32 application and that another program is currently using it. It also tells me another program is currently using task mgr. It tells me the same thing with MoparScape. Does anyone know the problem and how to fix it and get rid of these damn viruses?</p>
