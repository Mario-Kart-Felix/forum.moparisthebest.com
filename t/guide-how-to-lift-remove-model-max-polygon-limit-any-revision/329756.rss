    <title>[Guide] How to lift/ remove model max polygon limit [Any revision]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/guide-how-to-lift-remove-model-max-polygon-limit-any-revision/329756</link>
    <description>It&#39;s very easy to find for any revision, I&#39;ll quickly guide through how to do it for 317 and 508, but it&#39;s generally same thing for any revision, just that it&#39;s stored in different classes.

[U][B]508:[/B][/U]

open up [B]Class1_Sub3_Sub1.java[/B] and scroll down to very bottom.
The rest should be dead obvious, just change the 4096&#39;s to anything you please, for e.g. 65536.

[U][B]317:[/B][/U]

open up [B]Models.java[/B] if you have renamed client.
Very bottom again and do same thing as I said for 508. Manipulate the 4096, 2000, 1500. I dunno which one it is exactly, because I only tested for 508, so just try changing all or some until it works, [B]just don&#39;t touch the 12&#39;s and 10&#39;s. [/B]
If you have non renamed client then look below.

[U][B]Any other revision or non renamed 317:[/B][/U]

Simply do a search of [B]&quot;new int[4096]&quot;[/B] including quotation marks, it will usually find 1-6 classes. 
Look through each one and find one that has a lot of 4096 ints, or looks something similar to this:
[CODE]
	aByteArray3370 = new byte[1];
	anIntArray3372 = new int[10];
	anIntArray3371 = new int[12];
	anIntArray3373 = new int[4096];
	anIntArray3368 = new int[4096];
	anIntArray3380 = new int[4096];
	aBooleanArray3381 = new boolean[4096];
	anIntArray3374 = new int[4096];
	anIntArray3382 = new int[4096];
	anIntArrayArray3379 = new int[12][4096];
	anIntArray3384 = new int[4096];
	aBooleanArray3375 = new boolean[4096];
	anIntArray3378 = new int[10];
	anIntArray3388 = new int[12];
	anIntArray3385 = new int[10];
	anIntArray3386 = new int[4096];
	anIntArray3383 = new int[4096];
	anIntArray3389 = new int[1600];
	anIntArrayArray3387 = new int[1600][512];
  [/CODE]

And you&#39;re good to go ;)

don&#39;t worry, it do any harm to your client, you will simply lift up the polygon limit. You should all use models with higher polygons, Runescape has hundreds of thousands of players online at same time in a huge world, so they set that limit, whereas we have like what.. 100-500? lol.
I successfully loaded few models with ~30k polygons each at same time and it didn&#39;t lagg at all ^^
Also, the higher polygon models would look much better in HD client, so if anyone could add custom model loading to 508 or some other revision HD client, I&#39;d be really pleased :)

Have fun.

a big difference from the new engines than the old is the fact native code is used for rendering (direct x, opengl and the like).</p>

Over a years old topic dude cmon. Also, this is not in class8.java, as said, search your client for a class with a ton of int arrays containing 4096 for the length.</p>

<p>Don’t worry too much about the [1500] this is for model extents, means the maximum x,y,z value is +/-1024… sqrt(1024²*1024²) = 1448.1546 (so they use 1500 to make sure)</p>
<p>You changed the gzip buffer limit as well? will need to…</p>
<p>Now the really boring bit…<br>
Be realistic in the new value you set, 30k polygons is stupid, the client uses fixed point arithmatic which basically means any vertices less than 4 units in distance will end up at the same point on the screen. That means the client would do lots of calculations and end up not drawing half the triangles. 8k polygons is probably more than you’ll need without having the client waste its time calculating stuff that won’t be drawn.[/quote]<br>
I see, thanks.</p>
<p>How’s it going with the new datmaker, by the way?</p>

              <p>Ok you can do this [4096]=max number of triangles<br>
the [2000]=max number of triangles with a priority, this is for when priority values are given in the file and not just using the flag value. NEED TO CHANGE THIS TO YOUR NEW VALUE</p>
<p>Don’t worry too much about the [1500] this is for model extents, means the maximum x,y,z value is +/-1024… sqrt(1024²*1024²) = 1448.1546 (so they use 1500 to make sure)</p>
<p>You changed the gzip buffer limit as well? will need to…</p>
<p>Now the really boring bit…<br>
Be realistic in the new value you set, 30k polygons is stupid, the client uses fixed point arithmatic which basically means any vertices less than 4 units in distance will end up at the same point on the screen. That means the client would do lots of calculations and end up not drawing half the triangles. 8k polygons is probably more than you’ll need without having the client waste its time calculating stuff that won’t be drawn.</p>

<p>The only reason they have that limit is because they have hundreds of thousands of players online and as they said, their main aim of Runescape is for it to be available to play anywhere on any computer, therefore they don’t want to have a bigger polygon limit so players who have shitty computers would be able to play without lagg.

<p>Also, I am not suggesting you to add models with 30k polygons or so lol, it was just an experiment that I done.<br>
Normal polygon count used by games these days is anywhere up to 2k-5k, more or less. Runescape is way too low, using like max 500-1k polys per model. If they used textures with the models, then even the 500 polygons per model would look just fine, but since they use shitty coloring, it looks just awful -.-</p>

<p>I had already figured it out, im just trying to convince you to clear stuff up, because i know that 80% of mopar wont know enough to look around. 60% of that 80% will just say “nope not there” and stop, thinking you must be working with a custom client. The other 40% will scroll around for 5 minutes, and about 50% of those people will actually find and figure it out.</p>

<p>Are not in Class30_Sub2_Sub4_Sub6.java (Model.java) Nore does it count that high in that file. Obviously your not giving 317, possibly 377, but not 317</p>

they have a reason for limiting polygon count.<br>
[/quote]<br>
The only reason they have that limit is because they have hundreds of thousands of players online and as they said, their main aim of Runescape is for it to be available to play anywhere on any computer, therefore they don’t want to have a bigger polygon limit so players who have shitty computers would be able to play without lagg. Nothing for us to worry about, when we have like few hundred users online.</p>
<p>Also, I am not suggesting you to add models with 30k polygons or so lol, it was just an experiment that I done.<br>
Normal polygon count used by games these days is anywhere up to 2k-5k, more or less. Runescape is way too low, using like max 500-1k polys per model. If they used textures with the models, then even the 500 polygons per model would look just fine, but since they use shitty coloring, it looks just awful -.-</p>
<p>Thanks[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure she knows what she’s talking about. As she did revolutionize Runescape P-Servers</p>

<p>Runescapes 525+ HD has a texture on nearly every item/model. Also, the poly limit already is 2k, so i wouldnt increase it past that.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/stuff">@Stuff</a> you gave me to change - Your giving 508+ ints, and booleans. Please, to avoid MAJOR confusion, i would do a bit of reasearch and have each one for the correct version[/quote]<br>
High detail doesn’t have proper textures for everything. They “faked” it to look like as if everything was textured with a method called “procedural texturing”, which is literally shit. They are caring about users with lame pc’s too much, that’s why they’re using it instead of normal texturing. Of course it would take longer to load and stuff, but who cares if it takes few minutes longer than it usually does…? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/stuff">@Stuff</a> I gave you to change - I’m not giving 508+. I’m giving 508, then 317 and lastly any other revision…</p>
