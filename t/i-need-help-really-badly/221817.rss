    <description>hey people what is happen well i came to ask all of you how do you close the connection of the server then reopen it though a single bat file this is also know as restarting the server this is what my bat file says so far i put a timer on it 
[code]:Restart
cls
java -Xmx1024m -cp 
.;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.
0.17-ga-bin.jar server

ping localhost -n 7200 &gt; nul

[/code]
the [code]ping localhost -n 7200 &gt; nul[/code] is what you use to restart the server every 2 hours well i am trying to make it work like that well i need help from some that know really well about .bat files so they can tell me how to close the server for like 10 sec&#39;s then the server connections reopen and restarts thanks for reading i also think i might of help some people though to... well again thanks for reading and leave a post if you know what to do thanks</description>
