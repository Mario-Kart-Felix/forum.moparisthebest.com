    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-the-world-today/437612</link>
    <description>Nah this is small problem compared to the real world problems but this video is funny because all this punk as bitch keeps saying is &quot;fucking lawsuit&quot; &quot;im going to sue you&quot; etc... is that what we do today? waste the courts time with shit like this, every-time a little fucking problem arises the first thing people do is sue someone, that fucking kid got the short end of what he really deserved, getting his ask kicked

Anyways discuss what you would have liked to see happen in this video

<p>I agree, the whole pushing started when the guy tried to walk past both of the bouncers, but as you said the red bouncer let that guy get to him and made it more personal than it had to be</p>
