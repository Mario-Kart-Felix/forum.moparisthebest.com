    <title>[508] Some Weird Problem!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-some-weird-problem/275071</link>
    <description>Okay, so I&#39;m trying to get my 508 going... but as you can guess, I&#39;m getting a compiling problem. Now before you hit &quot;back&quot; on your browser, just read.

I CAN compile the server and make changes etc with NO errors whatsoever. But, when I start the server AFTER the compiled changes, nothing has been changed at all in the server. I did speak to some people in the mopar IRC chat, and someone said that it may be that my compiler may not be saving the compiled files in the correct folder(s) (how would I fix this?) or that the server isn&#39;t reading the files from the right folder(s).

Anyone have any ideas?</description>
