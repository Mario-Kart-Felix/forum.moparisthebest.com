    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-will-be-of-us/377255</link>
    <description>I didnt think this would go in the rs section, because im talking about private servers, eh, anyways, with the free trade enabled and pking, what will become of us private servers?? Wont we die out? I mean when jagex releases retarded updates, thats a win win for us, because more people play private servers, but when they release a good update like this, then we just may loose all players!</description>

Correct me if I am wrong but I’m pretty sure that this site was made when the wilderness still existed, and was at its peak when it still existed, so I do not think anything will happen. PK’ing is only one of the traits that private servers have.<br>

<p>Agreed completely.</p>
<p>This site has already started to die, and especially with this community not very interested in RSPS (we are based on it, yes, but look around at the topics, there are no advancements).</p>

I think that we will actually get more people. If RuneScape gets more players from the update, more of them will be interested in private servers.<br>
[/quote]<br>
The proportion will remain relatively constant…[/quote]Which is why I’m saying we will get more people?</p>
<p>More RS players = More RSPS players</p>
<p>I guess I phrased this wrong:<br>
“more of them” should be “more people”</p>

Like me, i came because im bored of runescape, i think others have too which is where they can come here and learn and chill without faggots reporting you for saying somebodys name which is a censor.</p>
