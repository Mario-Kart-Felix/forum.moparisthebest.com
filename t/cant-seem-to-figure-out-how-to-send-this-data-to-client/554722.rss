    <description>Hey guys, 

I found this code in my 550 client...
[code=java]
int j5 = Class142_Sub27_Sub3.incomingVector.readUnsignedByteA();
int y = Class40.anInt699 + (j5 &amp; 7);
int x = KeyHandler.anInt2380 + (7 &amp; j5 &gt;&gt; 4);
[/code]

Looks pretty simple enough. I just wanted to know how I should send var j5 to the client. What would the method look like? 

What I have tried is...
[code=java]
j5 = ((x &lt;&lt; 4) &amp; 0x7) | (y &amp; 0x7);
[/code]

However that just returns 0. 

Any suggestions?</description>

<p>That makes no sense. I am already sending the correct data type.</p>
<p>Notice:</p>
<p><code>int y = Class40.anInt699 + (j5 &amp; 7);
int x = KeyHandler.anInt2380 + (7 &amp; j5 &gt;&gt; 4);</code></p>
<p>The X/Y are generated from the j5 variable. What I was trying to work out was how to generate the value the client needs.<br>
I can now do this already.</p>
