[i][size=14pt]About[/size][/i]

[size=9pt]
ValorScape is an old server name of mine. A server that I use to host back in 06, when I first joined RSPS. Since then, I have improved [i]a lot[/i] in RSPS development. So, I thought it would be nice to give this project the name!
This server is based off [u][url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=473538.0]Rs2 Server 474 (Hyperion)[/url][/u], [u]improved[/u] immensely by me.
All the content added onto this base was done by [b]me[/b], no one else, no &#39;development teams&#39;, just [b]me[/b]. All my work!

I&#39;ve been working on this source for a year exact, and still today. I do not plan on moving on to another source at all; I&#39;m going to keep improving the base over time!
For those who think this is a 317; IT ISN&#39;T! Rs2 Server is based off a [b]real 474[/b], with a [b]real 474[/b] client/cache!
I choose the 474 because I really don&#39;t like the interface system on the 317 Revision! That&#39;s the only reason why I refuse to work with 317 bases because of it&#39;s UGLY UGLY interface system! 377+ have suuuuch a better interface system and that&#39;s why I prefer to use any revision other than 317 :) but that&#39;s just me.
[/size]

[i][size=14pt]Code[/size][/i][size=9pt]I&#39;m very OCD when it comes to programming the server... literally, I will take my time fixing someone until it&#39;s done right! I really love the OO design of Hyperion, so nothing is ever cramped into one file..
I try to keep every classes as clean as possible with documentation, no useless/unused methods, and everything else just done in a neat way.
I am aware kinda aware of performance, i&#39;ll start going on to that next week.

[b]CutScene System:[/b]
This is a flexible system I first made. As seen in Rs2&#39;s introduction login, you start in Falador Castle and automatically walk towards this NPC that talks to you etc, it&#39;s all in here:

[/size][code]package org.hyperion.rs2.model.cutscene.impl;

import org.hyperion.rs2.Constants;
import org.hyperion.rs2.model.*;
import org.hyperion.rs2.net.ActionSender;
import org.hyperion.rs2.tickable.Tickable;
import org.hyperion.rs2.util.NameUtils;

import java.io.File;

public class SquireCutScene extends AbstractCutScene {

    /**
     * The singleton instance.
     */
    private static final SquireCutScene INSTANCE = new SquireCutScene();

    /**
     * Gets the singleton instance.
     *
     * @return The singleton instance.
     */
    public static SquireCutScene getScene() {
        return INSTANCE;
    }

    @Override
    public String getAttributeName() {
        return &quot;squire&quot;;
    }

    @Override
    public void start(final Player player) {
        player.getActionSender().sendWindowPane(Constants.MAIN_WINDOW);
        File f = new File(&quot;data/savedGames/&quot; + NameUtils.formatNameForProtocol(player.getName()) + &quot;.dat.gz&quot;);
        if (!f.exists()) {
            NPC npc = new NPC(NPCDefinition.forId(606), Location.create(2965, 3367, player.getIndex() * 4), null, null, 6);
            World.getWorld().register(npc);
            player.setAttribute(&quot;squire&quot;, npc);

            World.getWorld().submit(new Tickable(2) {
                @Override
                public void execute() {
                    player.getWalkingQueue().reset();
                    player.getWalkingQueue().addStep(2965, 3365);
                    player.getWalkingQueue().finish();
                }
            });

            World.getWorld().submit(new Tickable(20) {
                @Override
                public void execute() {
                    getDialogues(player, 1);
                    this.stop();
                }
            });
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void getDialogues(Player player, int id) {
        switch (id) {
            case 1:
                player.getActionSender().sendDialogue(&quot;Squire&quot;, ActionSender.DialogueType.NPC, 606, Animation.FacialAnimation.DEFAULT,
                        &quot;Congratulations, &quot; + player.getName() + &quot;! You have just completed&quot;,
                        &quot;the White Knight training course. Now it is time for you&quot;,
                        &quot;to venture out into our wide world, and defend it as an&quot;,
                        &quot;honourable White Knight.&quot;);
                player.getInterfaceState().setNextDialogueId(0, 2);
                break;
            case 2:
                player.getActionSender().sendDialogue(&quot;Squire&quot;, ActionSender.DialogueType.NPC, 606, Animation.FacialAnimation.DEFAULT,
                        &quot;Here is your complimentary starter pack.&quot;);
                player.getInterfaceState().setNextDialogueId(0, 3);
                break;
            case 3:
                stop(player);
                break;
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void stop(Player player) {
        super.stop(player);
        if (player.getAttribute(getAttributeName()) != null) {
            World.getWorld().unregister((NPC) player.getAttribute(getAttributeName()));
            Location teleport = Location.create(2965, 3365, 0);
            player.setLocation(teleport);
            player.setTeleportTarget(teleport);
            player.removeAttribute(getAttributeName());
            player.getActionSender().removeAllInterfaces().sendDefaultChatbox().sendSidebarInterfaces();
        }
    }
}
[/code][size=9pt]
How do you you use it?
[/size][code]SquireCutScene squireScene = new SquireCutScene(); //or use a singleton
player.setCutscene(squireScene); //only ONE cutscene can be happening!
squireScene.start(player);[/code][size=9pt]

[i][b]What&#39;s a &#39;CustomInput&#39; ?[/b][/i]
I didn&#39;t know what else to name it, but it&#39;s another flexible system I made for custom inputs! As shown below:
[/size]&lt;blockquote&gt;[size=9pt][img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/66646093/RuneScape/RSPS/valor/10.png[/img]
[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/66646093/RuneScape/RSPS/valor/11.png[/img]
[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/66646093/RuneScape/RSPS/valor/12.png[/img]

[CODE]               CustomInput preach = new CustomInput(player, &quot;What would you like to say?&quot;) {

                    @Override
                    public void doActions() {
                        player.getActionSender().removeChatboxInterface();
                        player.forceChat(getInputText());
                        player.playAnimation(Animation.PREACH);
                    }
                };
                preach.execute();[/CODE][/size]&lt;/blockquote&gt;[size=9pt]

[i][b]Quest System[/b][/i]
Probably one of the most interesting ones that i&#39;ve added! Took for ever and still does needs improvement, but as of right now, it&#39;s pretty good!
First quest you&#39;ll see on the server is the Dwarf Cannon quest, I added a custom Werewolf quest before but I decided to remove it =p

The quest system is very easy to use, very easy to make a custom quest of your own all in a class file without jumping here to there etc.
[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/66646093/RuneScape/RSPS/474%20SQL/images/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-19%20at%2012.54.41%20AM.png[/img]
Shown in this pic, only one quest works which is dwarf cannon
[/size][code]register(15, new DwarfCannonQuest());[/code][code]register(BUTTON_ID, QUEST_CLASS);[/code][size=9pt]
Any other quest you try to open will just return a message &quot;it&#39;s not added yet&quot; 
I won&#39;t be showing you the full code but i&#39;ll explain some:
[/size][code]    @Override
    public boolean deathHook(Player player) {
//blank
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    public void killHook(Mob killer, Mob victim) {
//blank
    }

    @Override
    public void logoutHook(Player player) {
//blank
    }[/code][size=9pt]
In most custom user made quests, people like adding &#39;Zombie minigames&#39; or some things like that. The quest systems hooks up onto player deaths, when you kill a player, and what happens when you logout! All you gotta do is fill in the blanks, once again it&#39;s [i]really easy[/i] adding your own custom quests with this system

[i][b]Listeners[/b][/i]
I did not make this one, this actually was released on another forum. 
[/size]&lt;blockquote&gt;[size=9pt]Description
The PlayerListener system I shall be explaining here, is a simple implementation of the system I&#39;ve added to my own source. It allows a more stable, convenient and better performing way to perform certain actions when certain events occur. This tutorial will not add any specific features, but will allow an easier access to actually add them.

For example, I currently have the bank deposit box, the trading system, and a start of personal shops. And they are all using this system to secure their actions in a more convenient way than currently seen in the private server scene. In the future, I plan on creating a lot more features with the use of this system.

The concept of it is quite simple, really. It&#39;s just a far better performing way to e.g. revert a trade when a player gets disconnected. Instead of having one or more methods which check if the player is trading when it got disconnected and perform actions if so, this will just allow you to actually perform these actions while the player is in a trade. When the player is no longer in a trade, you simply remove the assigned PlayerListener implementation and it will no longer perform the desired actions within.

Because this system is quite extensible, I will not be giving you everything of it. I will show you how to implement it, and give you an example to demonstrate how it works. So if you&#39;re not up to learning some basic Java or are just aiming to cram as much as tutorials as possible into your source, this thread (or the entire Hyperion source for that matter) is not meant for you.[/size]&lt;/blockquote&gt;[size=9pt]
Credits to him!
I&#39;ve changed it up a LOT though. The server does have a scripting system (JavaScript, Ruby, &amp; Python), it&#39;s very easy to hook up let&#39;s say a ActionButtonListener to a script file. I do not feel like explaining it.

Example usages of the Listener System:
[/size][code]    /**
     * Listens for when an Entity dies.
     */
    public interface DeathListener extends AbstractListener {

        /**
         * Executes once the mob revives
         */
        public abstract void afterDeath(Mob killer, Mob victim);

        /**
         * Executes once the mob dies
         */
        public abstract void beforeDeath(Mob killer, Mob victim);

    }[/code][size=9pt]                                 

Might be confused why there is two stages of dying; let me explain: Let&#39;s say when you die, the grim reaper shows up, like RIGHT when you die, he&#39;ll be there taunting you for like 3 seconds then disappear, then you respond at Lumbridge or something idk.    

Not a good shot but here&#39;s a grim reaper showing up

[/size]
[i][size=14pt]Server[/size][/i][size=7pt]
This isn&#39;t no &#39;old school remake,&#39; although it does have the look &amp; feel to it. This server is [b]SQL BASED[/b]! 
[b]Player saving and loading is done via SQL[/b], it is NOT recommended running a source like this connected to a virtual host unless it&#39;s from the same computer it&#39;s running on!
I made the server to work with the [b][url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=564369.0]RuneScape Community Script[/url][/b]. I&#39;ve programmed the server to work with the site, well like share thing with each other.. The RCS script that i&#39;m using it modified by a lot by [i]me[/i].

The server does require a registered account on the site to play! There is NO CONNECTION TO THE DATABASE between this time of checking wether the player is registered or not!
Sounds weird, but well, the checking is done from the website, as seen in one of Martin&#39;s tutorial

[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/66646093/RuneScape/RSPS/474%20SQL/images/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-18%20at%202.55.12%20PM.png[/img]

Another neat thing i&#39;ve added was the Login Screen checkings! Since the RSC Website Script comes with a full functional Recovery system, message centre and forums, it was very easy integrating it to the server: Unread private [b]message from the site[/b], and [u]seen in game[/u]
[img]http://dl.dropbox.com/u/66646093/RuneScape/RSPS/474%20SQL/images/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-18%20at%203.09.47%20PM.png[/img]

I&#39;m not going to waste time on what skills finished and what skills aren&#39;t added, but if you really want to know (losers):
[/size]&lt;blockquote&gt;[size=7pt]Green = done
Yellow = almost
Red = not added[/size]&lt;/blockquote&gt;[size=7pt]

[i][b]Skills:[/b][/i]
[/size]
[ul][li]Agility (not all courses added yet)[/li]
	[li]Fletching[/li]
	[li]Herblore[/li]
	[li]Mining[/li]
	[li]Theiving (pickpocketing &amp; stalls)[/li]
	[li]Smithing (interface bug[/li]
	[li]Woodcutting[/li][/ul]
[i][b]Combat:[/b][/i]
What could I say? Rs2&#39;s combat seems pretty flawless to me..
Add-ons i&#39;ve added/fixes:

[ul][li]Added Full Void + bonuses[/li]
	[li]Added more weapons (Barrelchest Anchor)[/li]
	[li]Weapons can be assigned a specific hit time (how long it takes for the hit to register in ticks) in XML files[/li]
	[li]King Black Dragon with random attacks (fire, melee vice versa at random times)[/li][/ul]
Sorry for being vague with combat details, trust me, it&#39;s good!

[i][b]Miscellanies [/b][/i]

[ul][li]Sound System (All spells, all prayers, item pickup/drop, doors, etc.) EXCEPT ENTITY&amp;WEAPON sounds[/li]
	[li]Map Fixes (client side)[/li][/ul]

[ul][li]More that i&#39;ll go in depth with...[/li][/ul]

Media[/b][/size]

Telegrab was added months ago; I made it use the same action system as picking up an item so there wouldn&#39;t be two different Action Systems when picking up an item o.O 
I&#39;ve tested all the possible ways of duping in telegrab, I tried picking it up then telegrabbing, telegrab then pickup, one player telegrabs while player two tries to pick it up etc
works 100% =P (yay) it even has sounds i think

As I was saying about my last custom quest, it will be possible to obtain  ring that can turn you into a werewolf (worgen)
That&#39;s not top priority right now, i&#39;m still working on SQL saving &amp; other website/server related. Content is the last thing to add!

[size=18pt][i][b]Upcoming Goals/Updates[/b][/i][/size]
The membership system is different, it&#39;s not a &#39;true or false&#39;, wether the player is a member or not!
In Rs2 it goes by days, ex: quick write up

[code]public boolean isMember(){
  if(memberDays &gt; 0)
    return false
return true;
}[/code]

There&#39;s also an expiration date too. I plan on using the membership features for donators! I&#39;m currently working on this PayPal IPN system so for anyone who donates gets 40 membership days and will expire at one point etc. 

For those who read this thread, thank you haha
This took awhile to type up. Updates will be posted at the very top, any more pictures will be under the media section.

<p>Use configs, you won’t have the colours on the text wrong then.</p>

</aside>
<p>Oh yeah forgot about those!<br>
**It’s gonna take for ever adding those… cause it has to be an exact number e.g.:<br>
Doric’s quest:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>anything past 101 goes back to yellow, but if it’s on 101 it’s green</p>
<p>Dragon Slayer:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>it’s all random :s</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Make a command to loop through the configs every 2 ticks or so and watch the quest tab.[/quote]</p>
<p>i’ve found a list for the Free Quests, that’s done but Members is gonna take awhile… I think i’m just going to stick with what I have and change the colors to as close as the real thing<br>
I don’t really plan on remaking all the quests anyways, they’re all gonna be custom :s</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=14pt]About[/size]</span></p>
<p>[size=9pt]<br>
ValorScape is an old server name of mine. A server that I use to host back in 06, when I first joined RSPS. Since then, I have improved <span class="bbcode-i">a lot</span> in RSPS development. So, I thought it would be nice to give this project the name!<br>
This server is based off <span class="bbcode-u"><a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=473538.0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Rs2 Server 474 (Hyperion)</a></span>, <span class="bbcode-u">improved</span> immensely by me.<br>
All the content added onto this base was done by <span class="bbcode-b">me</span>, no one else, no ‘development teams’, just <span class="bbcode-b">me</span>. All my work!</p>
<p>I’ve been working on this source for a year exact, and still today. I do not plan on moving on to another source at all; I’m going to keep improving the base over time!<br>
For those who think this is a 317; IT ISN’T! Rs2 Server is based off a <span class="bbcode-b">real 474</span>, with a <span class="bbcode-b">real 474</span> client/cache!<br>
I choose the 474 because I really don’t like the interface system on the 317 Revision! That’s the only reason why I refuse to work with 317 bases because of it’s UGLY UGLY interface system! 377+ have suuuuch a better interface system and that’s why I prefer to use any revision other than 317 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> but that’s just me.<br>
[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">[size=14pt]Code[/size]</span>[size=9pt]I’m very OCD when it comes to programming the server… literally, I will take my time fixing someone until it’s done right! I really love the OO design of Hyperion, so nothing is ever cramped into one file…<br>
I try to keep every classes as clean as possible with documentation, no useless/unused methods, and everything else just done in a neat way.<br>
I am aware kinda aware of performance, i’ll start going on to that next week.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">CutScene System:</span><br>
This is a flexible system I first made. As seen in Rs2’s introduction login, you start in Falador Castle and automatically walk towards this NPC that talks to you etc, it’s all in here:</p>

How do you you use it?<br>
[/size]<code>SquireCutScene squireScene = new SquireCutScene(); //or use a singleton
player.setCutscene(squireScene); //only ONE cutscene can be happening!
squireScene.start(player);</code>[size=9pt]</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">What’s a ‘CustomInput’ ?</span></span><br>
I didn’t know what else to name it, but it’s another flexible system I made for custom inputs! As shown below:<br>

<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Quest System</span></span><br>
Probably one of the most interesting ones that i’ve added! Took for ever and still does needs improvement, but as of right now, it’s pretty good!<br>
First quest you’ll see on the server is the Dwarf Cannon quest, I added a custom Werewolf quest before but I decided to remove it =p</p>
<p>The quest system is very easy to use, very easy to make a custom quest of your own all in a class file without jumping here to there etc.<br>
<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/66646093/RuneScape/RSPS/474%20SQL/images/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-19%20at%2012.54.41%20AM.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Shown in this pic, only one quest works which is dwarf cannon<br>
[/size]<code>register(15, new DwarfCannonQuest());</code><code>register(BUTTON_ID, QUEST_CLASS);</code>[size=9pt]<br>
Any other quest you try to open will just return a message “it’s not added yet”<br>
I won’t be showing you the full code but i’ll explain some:<br>
[/size][code]    <a class="mention" href="/u/override">@Override</a><br>
public boolean deathHook(Player player) {<br>
//blank<br>
return true;<br>
}</p>
<pre><code>@Override
public void killHook(Mob killer, Mob victim) {
</code></pre>
<p>//blank<br>
}</p>
<pre><code>@Override
public void logoutHook(Player player) {
</code></pre>
<p>//blank<br>
}[/code][size=9pt]<br>
In most custom user made quests, people like adding ‘Zombie minigames’ or some things like that. The quest systems hooks up onto player deaths, when you kill a player, and what happens when you logout! All you gotta do is fill in the blanks, once again it’s <span class="bbcode-i">really easy</span> adding your own custom quests with this system</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Listeners</span></span><br>
I did not make this one, this actually was released on another forum.<br>
[/size]</p>
<blockquote>[size=9pt]Description<br>
The PlayerListener system I shall be explaining here, is a simple implementation of the system I’ve added to my own source. It allows a more stable, convenient and better performing way to perform certain actions when certain events occur. This tutorial will not add any specific features, but will allow an easier access to actually add them.
<p>For example, I currently have the bank deposit box, the trading system, and a start of personal shops. And they are all using this system to secure their actions in a more convenient way than currently seen in the private server scene. In the future, I plan on creating a lot more features with the use of this system.</p>
<p>The concept of it is quite simple, really. It’s just a far better performing way to e.g. revert a trade when a player gets disconnected. Instead of having one or more methods which check if the player is trading when it got disconnected and perform actions if so, this will just allow you to actually perform these actions while the player is in a trade. When the player is no longer in a trade, you simply remove the assigned PlayerListener implementation and it will no longer perform the desired actions within.</p>
<p>Because this system is quite extensible, I will not be giving you everything of it. I will show you how to implement it, and give you an example to demonstrate how it works. So if you’re not up to learning some basic Java or are just aiming to cram as much as tutorials as possible into your source, this thread (or the entire Hyperion source for that matter) is not meant for you.[/size]</p>

Credits to him!<br>
I’ve changed it up a LOT though. The server does have a scripting system (JavaScript, Ruby, &amp; Python), it’s very easy to hook up let’s say a ActionButtonListener to a script file. I do not feel like explaining it.
<p>Example usages of the Listener System:<br>
[/size][code]    /**<br>
* Listens for when an Entity dies.<br>
*/<br>
public interface DeathListener extends AbstractListener {</p>
<pre><code>    /**
     * Executes once the mob revives
     */
    public abstract void afterDeath(Mob killer, Mob victim);

    /**
     * Executes once the mob dies
     */
    public abstract void beforeDeath(Mob killer, Mob victim);

}[/code][size=9pt]                                 
</code></pre>
<p>Might be confused why there is two stages of dying; let me explain: Let’s say when you die, the grim reaper shows up, like RIGHT when you die, he’ll be there taunting you for like 3 seconds then disappear, then you respond at Lumbridge or something idk.</p>
<p>Not a good shot but here’s a grim reaper showing up<br>

<span class="bbcode-i">[size=14pt]Server[/size]</span>[size=7pt]<br>
This isn’t no ‘old school remake,’ although it does have the look &amp; feel to it. This server is <span class="bbcode-b">SQL BASED</span>!<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Player saving and loading is done via SQL</span>, it is NOT recommended running a source like this connected to a virtual host unless it’s from the same computer it’s running on!<br>
I made the server to work with the <span class="bbcode-b"><a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=564369.0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">RuneScape Community Script</a></span>. I’ve programmed the server to work with the site, well like share thing with each other… The RCS script that i’m using it modified by a lot by <span class="bbcode-i">me</span>.</p>
<p>The server does require a registered account on the site to play! There is NO CONNECTION TO THE DATABASE between this time of checking wether the player is registered or not!<br>
Sounds weird, but well, the checking is done from the website, as seen in one of Martin’s tutorial</p>
<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/66646093/RuneScape/RSPS/474%20SQL/images/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-18%20at%202.55.12%20PM.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Another neat thing i’ve added was the Login Screen checkings! Since the RSC Website Script comes with a full functional Recovery system, message centre and forums, it was very easy integrating it to the server: Unread private <span class="bbcode-b">message from the site</span>, and <span class="bbcode-u">seen in game</span><br>

<p>Telegrab was added months ago; I made it use the same action system as picking up an item so there wouldn’t be two different Action Systems when picking up an item o.O<br>
I’ve tested all the possible ways of duping in telegrab, I tried picking it up then telegrabbing, telegrab then pickup, one player telegrabs while player two tries to pick it up etc<br>
works 100% =P (yay) it even has sounds i think<br>

<p>As I was saying about my last custom quest, it will be possible to obtain  ring that can turn you into a werewolf (worgen)<br>
That’s not top priority right now, i’m still working on SQL saving &amp; other website/server related. Content is the last thing to add!<br>

The membership system is different, it’s not a ‘true or false’, wether the player is a member or not!<br>
In Rs2 it goes by days, ex: quick write up</p>
<p><code>public boolean isMember(){
  if(memberDays &gt; 0)
    return false
return true;
}</code></p>
<p>There’s also an expiration date too. I plan on using the membership features for donators! I’m currently working on this PayPal IPN system so for anyone who donates gets 40 membership days and will expire at one point etc.</p>
<p>For those who read this thread, thank you haha<br>
This took awhile to type up. Updates will be posted at the very top, any more pictures will be under the media section.</p>
