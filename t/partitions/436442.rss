    <description>So basically I want to delete Windows 7 from my file system. But on every tutorial they say I need to delete the partition.
So my question is, dafuq is a partition? And also, when I delete my C partition, does it delete my whole C drive or something?</description>

              <p>The only way you’re going to be able to do that is boot into a LiveCD of some sort (linux, Hiren’s, Windows Rescue CD, etc) Then just open up a partition manager, delete the partition, save changes, reboot.</p>
<p>Just be sure that you have some method of installing another OS, or else you’ll have a nice paperweight.</p>

<p>do you have any idea of what your saying. he is talking about ubuntu.<br>
First of all, install Ubuntu first as a partion, a partion is a part of the drive that you are going to separate for your ubuntu, then what you do is you is go through ubuntu and into the other partion, and delete it. Though I don’t see why you should not keep it, W7 is useful at times.<br>

Yes I got that part. Got another question. If I delete all my partitions and install Ubuntu again, will that just work?<br>

Like I said; just over-write it mate, no need to go through all that trouble.[/quote]<br>
no.</p>
<p>delete the partitions you won’t be using - you need to anyway if you wish to create a layout for your linux install. a few clicks in a UI or a few commands in a CLI isn’t that much trouble.</p>

protip: minimally linux needs two partitions to operate.<br>
protip2: there’s a partition phase of the install that occurs right before copying the system files for linux, soooo you can just do it then.</p>
