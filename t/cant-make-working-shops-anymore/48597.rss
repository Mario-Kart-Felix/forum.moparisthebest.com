    <title>Can&#39;t make working shops anymore</title>

    <description>Hi,
After i solved the &quot; all my npcs just started to act like a bank&quot; problem, i just found another one.
I cant make anymore shops =\ I did it all the correct way though. I made an npc spawn where i wanted to shop, added new shop to client. 
And added it in shops.cfg but when i talk to them, nothing happens.
When i just copy the old code from another shop to test it out, that wont work either. 
This is realy freaking me out all my npcs are going crazy *oh noes*
Some help please.</description>
