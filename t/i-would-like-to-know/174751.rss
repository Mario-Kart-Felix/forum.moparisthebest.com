    <description>[u][b]Are there people with this problem :[/b][/u]

I have no-ip DUC enabled, my run.bat server is running, opened firewall exceptions and opened ports on my router... (btw my router is a modem at the same time, its not a router connected through my modem, its literally a modem and a router at the same time) (i have vista)

The first time i did all of those things, my server was running very well and i had at least 15 people on, but ever since that day, I can&#39;t register my server on the status page, because it says my server is off line and i have just proved to you (reader) that it&#39;s not off line.

All help appreciated, Mike.</description>
