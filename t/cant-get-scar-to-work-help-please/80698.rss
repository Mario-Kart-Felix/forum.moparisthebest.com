    <title>Can&#39;t Get Scar To Work, Help Please!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-get-scar-to-work-help-please/80698</link>
    <description>So this is my first time trying to use SCAR. I&#39;ve tried a bunch of woodcutting programs, but can&#39;t get any to work. I downloaded both 3.01 and 2.03 versions, along with the latest includes and SRLs to my knowledge. There are 2 programs that I&#39;d like to get help with, cuz if I can figure out the problems with these two then I might be able to get others to work. Here they are:

1.
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,11863.0.html

I run this and get the error:
[Runtime Error] : Out Of Range in line 46 in script C:\DOCUME~1\Keegan\LOCALS~1\Temp\PCutter-6.scar

(its a line where you enter your username and password)

2. 
http://www.srl-forums.com/forum/powerkut-smartzkid-t9270.html (had to download version 2.03 for this)

I run this, SCAR does not identify any errors, but absolutely NOTHING happens in the game.

Honestly I have no idea what to do, after trying everything I can think of for a few hours. I&#39;m using the default RS client on runescape.com, and run the program when I&#39;m logged in. Is there a special client needed for SCAR scripts? Amd I supposed to run these programs after logging in or what?

I&#39;d appreciate any help. Thanks in advance!

              <p>Nevermind, the problem with the macro that did nothing was that it was actually updating itself lol. It works very well now. Autochops, autodetects trees according to my level, and auto lights them once the inventory is full. Thanks for those of you who posted.</p>
