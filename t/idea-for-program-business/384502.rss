    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/idea-for-program-business/384502</link>
    <description>At my university, we have a timetabling system whereby you enrol yourself into your desired classes. Each subject has it&#39;s own lectures, tutorials, seminars and practise sessions you can choose from. 

A program which calculates all the possible combinations of classes and produces a graphical representation thereof would be VERY convenient. This could be developed into an applet and if a website is made specifically for this, I believe it could be decently popular/profitable.

All you need is a simple interface where the user inputs their available class options and timings. The software should then calculate all the possible combinations without clashes, and generate small 250*400(or some similar size) images with representations of possible timetable combinations. The images don&#39;t need to display any text, all they need is multiple colours so that the student can differentiate between different classes. If a particular timetable appeals to a student, the student can simply click on it and the program provides specific details of which classes have been selected for that particular combination.

Example of small images:
[IMG]http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/5503/timetablerepresentation.png[/img]
This image shows how two possible combinations of timetables can be represented by the program. Each red rectangular block represents a tutorial/seminar/lecture.

If you don&#39;t want to write the program yourself, please share ideas as to the algorithm that you can use to generate possible combinations?</description>

Turns out there is software of this nature available on the internet, as lawl pointed out. Most of it is tailored to a particular university because it would be a hassle if the user is asked to fill in every single available lesson. I did find a site yesterday which allows you to fill in your own classes and I’ll probably use it next semester.<br>
[/quote]<br>
So then it is no point for me making something like this…[/quote]<br>
If you can make a better one and think you can market it better, it might well be worth making.</p>

<p>though at my uni we get to pick what times we get courses out of a few different sections, we dont have people picking it for us[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for that. The problem with that is that it’s built for your particular university where it looks up the times. In case anyone was confused about what I was talking about, lawl’s link is almost exactly what I wanted. The only difference is that I wanted something where the user specifies the times.</p>
<p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:9, topic:384502”]I bet that should not be hard to do, but I would not rely on me to do anything with it, since I tend not get distracted by things, and I’m not very experienced. But I will look into it tomorrow just to see if I’m able to make something like this.<br>
But you will have better luck getting someone else to do it…</p>
<p>EDIT: Sorry for my bad grammar. If I make something like this it would be in Actionscript, so it could be released to iPhone’s appstore or with ads as a flash applet for Android or the web.[/quote]</p>
<p>I guess it would be up to you, but I’d say that not everyone has an Iphone and so it wouldn’t be a good idea to model it for the iOS.</p>

<p>Yes, that’s exactly how it should work. I can’t really link you to my uni’s timetable system as you’d need login details.</p>

<p>Assuming that all universities allow you to choose your timetable, you can use it for any uni. The program doesn’t need to be pre-programmed with possible timings, rather the user should input them into the interface.</p>
<p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:7, topic:384502”]Ah, this is your classic scheduling problem.  Those are fun.  I remember working on them in algorithms class in college.  Personally, I’d probably go with PHP using the gd library to create the images, but an applet would work just as well.</p>
<p>As to those images, you mean it would display your schedule for one day on those?  If so, what about when different days are different?  Like many classes are only on Tuesday and Thursday, while others are MWF.[/quote]<br>
Those images each represent a possible week and each row represents a day. Since the program should be able to generate many combinations, I found that those images would probably be the best way a user can choose between large numbers of possible combinations.</p>
<p>My university gives me the option to choose from three different lecture timings. For example there might be only three scheduled classes for an Engineering Design lecture. I would have the option to choose from the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>01030-1230 Monday or</li>
<li>1430-1630 Tuesday or</li>
<li>1330-1530 Thursday</li>
</ul>
<p>That is only for one lecture. When you have 4 subjects with 4 lectures each, it can be hard to choose a decent timetable without clashes. For me personally, I am stuck in this semester with classes from 1430 - 1930 every Monday.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, here’s how I imagine it would work:<br>
<img src="http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/460/timetablemaker.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>All the program needs to do is generate all the different possible combinations of a,b,c or d - and not generate combinations that produce clashes. After calculating the possible combinations, it represents them using images like this:<br>
<img src="http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/5503/timetablerepresentation.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Edit: Is there anywhere I can suggest this to google?</p>

<p>Different courses, different timetables. The project would be pretty huge and they already have automated timetable generators, so they’re not going to help support this when they’re strapped for cash.</p>

              <p>At my university, we have a timetabling system whereby you enrol yourself into your desired classes. Each subject has it’s own lectures, tutorials, seminars and practise sessions you can choose from.</p>
<p>A program which calculates all the possible combinations of classes and produces a graphical representation thereof would be VERY convenient. This could be developed into an applet and if a website is made specifically for this, I believe it could be decently popular/profitable.</p>
<p>All you need is a simple interface where the user inputs their available class options and timings. The software should then calculate all the possible combinations without clashes, and generate small 250*400(or some similar size) images with representations of possible timetable combinations. The images don’t need to display any text, all they need is multiple colours so that the student can differentiate between different classes. If a particular timetable appeals to a student, the student can simply click on it and the program provides specific details of which classes have been selected for that particular combination.</p>
<p>Example of small images:<br>
<img src="http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/5503/timetablerepresentation.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
This image shows how two possible combinations of timetables can be represented by the program. Each red rectangular block represents a tutorial/seminar/lecture.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to write the program yourself, please share ideas as to the algorithm that you can use to generate possible combinations?</p>
