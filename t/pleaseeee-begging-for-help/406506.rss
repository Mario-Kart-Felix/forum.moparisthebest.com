              <p>Well i indeed have been able to get my server up, only after switching my ISP.</p>
<p>Please make sure that your ISP (Internet Service Provider) will actually allow you to forward ports through your modem (I’m assuming you have a router which you forward the ports in).</p>
<p>I use to have satillite internet, and tried every single type of hosting method, to no avail.</p>
<p>This could very well be the problem. My suggestion is to search for your ISP’s support site, or a forum on the subject of you’re ISP. Then check to see if your <span class="bbcode-b">actually aloud to forward ports with them</span></p>
<p>That’s all i can come up with.</p>
