    <title>Make it so that when a player is PKed they drop cash...?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-it-so-that-when-a-player-is-pked-they-drop-cash/302377</link>
    <description>How would i go about making it so that when a player was Pked they would drop a certain amount of cash, 995? I&#39;m using a 317 server.

Sorry if I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re talking about, if you answer... please try to answer with some detail. I wont understand if you don&#39;t explain it at all. It doesn&#39;t have to have HUGE detail, since i&#39;m not 100% new... but just some so that i could kind of understand it. I have good common sense, so i think I&#39;ll understand.

THANK YOU! :D</description>

<p>Prbably the easiest way you be to give the player the cash just before the drop item method. This may cause dupes but its easy. Another way would be just to make it create the item on the ground but im not sure how to make it show for just one person, it would be global.</p>

<p>How would i make the cash appear in the pkers inventory?</p>

              <p>Player death methods, so when the player dies they will drop money, is that what you mean? Or when he his killed by another player? Either way, the first thing i said would work.</p>
