    <title>Arma 3 [Arma 3 Lite Giveaway]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/arma-3-arma-3-lite-giveaway/507378</link>
    <description>Personally, I hated the new controls but the new crouches are not that half bad of an idea. Also was looking forward to being able to dive over things but I guess, this isn&#39;t Battlefield (which is completely overrated compared to this game). Had fun with it while I had it and cant wait to get it again. The fps hasn&#39;t really improved as much as I was anticipating but it was a few steps. I do however absolutely love the customization weapons, cannot wait to see what we can do with the Sniper Rifles. 

Bought the wrong package on the day of release so I have to wait a couple of working days before I can get my refund to buy the standard, lol.

So... wbu?

Btw, buy it now while it&#39;s cheap. The price is around $35USD and will be around $90USD when it&#39;s out of for full release, once you&#39;ve got Alpha you have Beta and the full game :)
