    <title>Class 8 [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/class-8-317/351302</link>
    <description>My class 8 got really screwed up and it had LOTS of items and now it doesn&#39;t work.
I was wondering if any of you guys have a class 8 with almost every item could upload your class 8 and send me a download link. Thanks.</description>
