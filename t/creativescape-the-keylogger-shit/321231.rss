    <description>Don&#39;t download Creativescape - the owner made development thread about the server and its in beta. I downloaded client today and when i runned the exe file, the client came up and i could play. I also got a keylogger of the fucking shit! I lost my lvl 98 and my lil brothers 87. When i was gonna login to runescape i visited world 54 and then i dueled some guys, then i had to switch world. 

i went to toilet and my lil dumb brother went on the computer and logged into runescape, he could login at that time. later he tried and said it was invalid username or password. bammmmm?! hacked, i tried with mine, i got: invalid username or password. i was like omfg!!?!

 He&#39;s crying and he&#39;s really upset. I&#39;m so fucking angry, can someone tell me how to get rid of it? I cant go on msn or anything bcuz im scared to get hacked again, my father maybe have to pay stuff on the internet, who knows what can happen? I had the same problem before. What should i do? I recommend to not play Creativescape, douchebag keylogger...

I would appreciate if someone gave me a new account and i&#39;ll train it up, gonna restart the computer and get windows 7. Then i&#39;ll never download that shit again. 

GOD DAMN!
