    <title>Weird error with equpping items</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weird-error-with-equpping-items/70292</link>
    <description>Hi,
I need some help with a little problem with items...
(Sorry if i make topics too often lets hope this is the last for today :P)

There were a few tutorials about &quot;fixing bad equippable items&quot; they were about to fix that you wear medhelms in your weapon slot, and your hair/beard is sticking out of it, i&#39;ve tried to follow their instructions, done everything right, but some of these just wont work!

For example, bronze medhelm. (ID: 1139)
As far as we know, we need to put the ID-s into the correct category.
(The categories are: capes, boots, gloves, shields, hats, amulets, arrows, rings, body, legs, platebody, fullhelm, fullmask)
Now, the bronze med only equips into the head slot if i put it into &#39;hats&#39; category, but the hair is sticking out. So i guess i need to put it into &#39;fullhelm&#39; because i think fullhelms particially remove hair so it wont stick out. I&#39;ve put it in there, but the hair still sticked out, and it was worn into the WEAPON slot!!! but how the hell? Some items like bronze med, just WONT WANNA WORK! =&#39;( I also tried fullmask. i guess the other categories wont work....

Any ideas?</description>
