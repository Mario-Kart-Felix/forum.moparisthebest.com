<p>It would be funny if those guys weren’t completely serious. Uganda has been in the news a lot lately for its draconian anti-gay laws. It seems some American evangelicals visited Uganda, made speeches and got them to pass laws like this.</p>

<p>Why does that concern you, though? Africa is a dump that has little to no effect on your day to day life.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t see why you can’t have a bit of compassion for your fellow human being.</p>
<p>edit: I’ll say more then that.<br>
Conservatives like you are well known for a lack of compassion, I’ve started to expect it.<br>
[/quote]<br>
You’re shitting me right? Countries like Australia, America, Britain etc still have homeless people on the streets. Thousands of them, every night.<br>
It makes more sense to me to display compassion for people in my country than it does for me to care about a foreign land. And for the record, homelessness does concern me.</p>
<p>Too many do-gooders in the world, such as yourself, only put on the act that they care – while drinking expensive coffee or eating expensive food, or while driving to their high-paying job in their expensive car.<br>
You donate for the gratification associated with it, not because you <span class="bbcode-b">really</span> care.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t see why caring about your own nationals more then others makes any sense at all when you think about how somebody becomes a citizen.<br>
The vast majority of people are citizens of the country they were born in, they didn’t choose their country any more then they chose their skin colour. When you say “I’ll support people from my own country more then other countries”, you’re giving out support for something that was a <span class="bbcode-b">complete accident</span>.</p>
<p>One of the pragmatic reasons for watching what other countries do is their bad policies could easily spread. Ireland had a blasphemy law but Pakistani lobbyists copypasted their wording and tried to push through a similar recommendation in the UN which would have required all countries to implement laws against drawing pictures of muhammad. Creationism which was predominantly an American phenomenon has attempted to spread to Britain and Australia. Climate change denial started with the American right wing and has rapidly spread around the world now. Holocaust denial started with German nationalists but spread to the middle-east due to anti-zionism. When America declared its independence and founded a country based on Enlightenment values, it soon spread to France where they had a revolution and seriously worried the British monarchy.</p>
<p>In this Uganda case we’ve seen rampant American homophobia spread to Africa, and who knows where else. How long until other countries get proposals, with the lobbyists saying “Well its working in the USA and Africa”</p>
<p>If the entire world become homophobic, except one nation, there would massive amounts of gay refugees who we cant send back because they would be executed.</p>

<p>Not true at all. There are numerous hurdles for a person to overcome before they get any assistance from centrelink (our social services).<br>
One of them is having an address to send paperwork to.<br>
Secondly, housing assistance has thousands of people that are in line to receive some sort of accommodation.</p>
<p>There are services like food vans and ‘hostel’-type places where you can seek shelter, but they’re overcrowded to the point that they have to turn people away all the time.</p>
<p>Virtually nobody chooses to be homeless. You get beaten or stabbed, robbed, you freeze and so on. There’d be maybe 1 in 1000 that goes out of their way to continue living on the streets; everyone else is there due to a series of unfortunate events, be it job loss or struggling to pay the rent despite having some form of income.</p>
