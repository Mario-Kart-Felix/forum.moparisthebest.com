              <p>You need to check that your Path environment variable is set correctly. This variable stores the location of the commands your computer uses. You’re probably familiar with some of them if you’ve ever used command prompt.</p>
<p>First you need to figure out your jdk version. To do this, go to C:\Program Files\Java\ and then select the folder with the highest jdk version number in its name and copy the name to your clipboard (ctrl + c). Now you need to go open your start menu and right click on “My computer” (Just “Computer” if you’re on windows vista/7) then click “Properties”.</p>
<p>If you’re on windows XP:<br>
Click on “Advanced settings” then click on “Environment variables”.</p>
<p>If you’re on windows vista/7:<br>
Look at the left of the window, there should be an option saying “Advanced system settings”. Click on that, then click on “Environment variables”.</p>
<p>Once you’re in the environment variables window, look for a variable in your system settings called “PATH”. Once you find it, double click on it then if there isn’t a semi-colon at the end, add a “;” to the end then add “C:\Program Files\Java&lt;your jdk version&gt;\bin;”. Be sure to replace the part in the &lt;&gt; brackets with your jdk version number(the one you copied to your clipboard earlier). Also don’t forget to remove the quotes before you add anything in.</p>
<p>If you encounter any problems, post here and I’ll try to help.</p>
<p>PS: it would be nice if you were to search the forums for your problem before asking about it as this has been asked a few times already.</p>

              <p>i need a blank client + source that is [PI] but i cant find one anywhere, i believe thats what i used to have.<br>
i remember it having a sprites folder and in notes it had something in there that said something like “ha, the passwords are encripted” and i remember being able to easily place enemies by puting in simple coordinates and typing in a few numbers to ID the monster i want to spawn, i know that it sounds like im asking for alot right? but ive been googling for over an hour now and cant find one thats the same as my old one…</p>
