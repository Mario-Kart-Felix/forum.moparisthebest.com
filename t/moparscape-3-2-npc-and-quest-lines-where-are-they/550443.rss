              <p>Moparscape 3.2 is no longer managed by the community, or anyone. It’s recommended you take a source &amp; client from the <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Downloads</a> section and to work on one of those.</p>
<p>There are thousands of beginner tutorials, and it’s highly recommended that you google before asking questions, as your question may have already been answered.</p>
