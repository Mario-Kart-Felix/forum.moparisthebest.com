              <p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">A preist was on the roof of his church as a freak flood swept through his town.  Every second the water was rising higher and higer, flowing into all the houses, and drowning many people.  But the priest had a plan.  He was going to pray to God to save him.
"Oh mightly Lord, i have only done what you wish all my life.  please save me from this flood."
Seconds passed, with the priest still hoping, but nothing happened.  A man in a boat came by and offered the priest a ride to safety.
"No," said the priest.  "God will save me."
He looked up again, and placed his hands together.
"Please God, have mercy on my soul."
Again, nothing spectacular happened.  A yatch came by, spotted the priest and the sailor offered the priest a ride to safety.
"No," the priest replied again.  "I have faith in my God.  He will save me."
The priest prayed for the last time.
"I beg of you.  Please save me God."
Minutes passed by with nothing happening.  Many more people passed the priest, some in boats, some in cruise ships, but the priest refused all of their offers, again saying that his God would save him.
The Water got too much, covered the priest and unfortunately he drowned.
Inside heaven, the priest went up to God and asked for an explination.
"Why God, why?  I have only done what you asked for all my life, and i have been a good person.  why did you not save me?"
And God replied:
"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK ALL THE DAMN BOATS WERE FOR THEN?!"</code></pre>

<p>Hahaha, nice one star!</p>

<blockquote>If Microsoft Built Cars... 

<ol>
<li><p>A particular model year of car wouldn't be available until after that year instead of before it. </p></li>
<li><p>Every time they repainted the lines on the road, you'd have to buy a new car. </p></li>
<li><p>Occasionally your car would just die for no reason, and you'd have to restart it. For some strange reason, you'd just accept this. </p></li>
<li><p>You could only have one person in the car at a time, unless you bought a Car 95 or a Car NT. But then you'd have to buy more seats. </p></li>
<li><p>Sun Motorsystems would make a car that was powered by the sun, twice as reliable, and five times as fast - but it would only run on 5 percent of the roads. </p></li>
<li><p>The oil, engine, gas, and alternator warning lights would be replaced with a single "General Car Fault" warning light. </p></li>
<li><p>People would get excited about the "new" features in Microsoft cars, forgetting completely that they had been available in other cars for years. </p></li>
<li><p>We'd all have to switch to Microsoft gas. </p></li>
<li><p>The U.S. government would be GETTING subsidies from an automaker, instead of giving them. </p></li>
<li><p>New seats would force everyone to have the same-size butt.</p></li>

<blockquote>Last year a friend of mine upgraded GirlFriend 1.0 to Wife 1.0 and found that it's a memory hog leaving very little system resources for other applications. He is only now noticing that Wife 1.0 also is spawning Child-Processes which are further consuming valuable resources. No mention of this particular phenomena was included in the product brochure or the documentation, though other users have informed him that this is to be expected due to the nature of the application. Not only that, Wife 1.0 installs itself such that it is always launched at system initialization where it can monitor all other system activity. He's finding that some applications such as PokerNight 10.3, BeerBash 2.5, and PubNight 7.0 are no longer able to run in the system at all, crashing the system when selected (even though they always worked fine before). 

<p>At installation, Wife 1.0 provides no option as to the installation of undesired Plug-Ins such as MotherInLaw 55.8 and BrotherInLaw Beta release. Also, system performance seems to diminish with each passing day. </p>

<p>The features he'd like to see in the upcoming Wife 2.0 include: </p>

<ul>
<li>A"Don't remind me again" button </li>
<li>Minimize button </li>
<li>An install shield feature that allows Wife 2.0 to be installed with the option to uninstall at anytime without the loss of cache and other system resources. <br>An option to run the network driver in promiscuous mode which would allow the systems hardware <br>probe feature to be much more useful. </li>
</ul>

<p>I myself decided to avoid all of the headaches associated with Wife 1.0 by sticking with Girlfriend 2.0. Even here, however, I found many problems. Apparently you cannot install Girlfriend 2.0 on top of Girlfriend 1.0. You must uninstall Girlfriend 1.0 first. Other users say this is a long standing bug which I should have been aware of. Apparently the versions of Girlfriend have conflicts over shared use of the I/O port. You think they would have fixed such a stupid bug by now. To make matters worse, The uninstall program for Girlfriend 1.0 doesn't work very well leaving undesirable <br>traces of the application in the system. </p>

<p>Another thing that sucks -- all versions of Girlfriend continually pop-up little annoying messages about the advantages of upgrading to Wife 1.0 </p>

<p>BUG WARNING </p>

<p>Wife 1.0 has an undocumented bug. If you try to install Mistress 1.1 before uninstalling Wife 1.0, Wife 1.0 will delete MSMoney files before doing the uninstall itself. Then Mistress 1.1 will refuse to install, claiming insufficient resources. </p>

<p>BUG WORK-AROUNDS <br>To avoid the above bug, try installing Mistress 1.1 on a different system and never run any file transfer applications such as LapLink 6.0. Also, beware of similar shareware applications that have been known to carry viruses that may affect Wife 1.0. </p>

<p>Another solution would be to run Mistress 1.0 via a UseNet provider under an anonymous name. Here again, beware of the viruses which can accidentally be downloaded from the UseNet.</p>

<p>I have another computer Type Joke:</p>

<p>A young son came running to his Daddy and asked, "Daddy, Daddy, how was I <br>born?"</p>

<p>Daddy said, "Oh, very well, my blessed son, one day you will find that out <br>anyway! Your Mom and I got together in a chat room on AOL. I, your Dad, set up a <br>date via e-mail<br>with your mom and we met at a cybercafe. We sneaked into a private room, and<br>then your mom stuck dad's memory stick into her USB port for downloading your <br>file. An excited Dad could not refuse went on to fully upload. It was <br>discovered that neither one of them had used a firewall. </p>

<p>Since it was too late to hit the delete button, nine months later the blessed <br>virus appeared."</p>

              <p>A preist was on the roof of his church as a freak flood swept through his town.  Every second the water was rising higher and higer, flowing into all the houses, and drowning many people.  But the priest had a plan.  He was going to pray to God to save him.</p>

<p>"Oh mightly Lord, i have only done what you wish all my life.  please save me from this flood."</p>

<p>Seconds passed, with the priest still hoping, but nothing happened.  A man in a boat came by and offered the priest a ride to safety.</p>

<p>"No," said the priest.  "God will save me."</p>

<p>He looked up again, and placed his hands together.</p>

<p>"Please God, have mercy on my soul."</p>

<p>Again, nothing spectacular happened.  A yatch came by, spotted the priest and the sailor offered the priest a ride to safety.</p>

<p>"No," the priest replied again.  "I have faith in my God.  He will save me."</p>

<p>The priest prayed for the last time.</p>

<p>"I beg of you.  Please save me God."</p>

<p>Minutes passed by with nothing happening.  Many more people passed the priest, some in boats, some in cruise ships, but the priest refused all of their offers, again saying that his God would save him.</p>

<p>The Water got too much, covered the priest and unfortunately he drowned.</p>

<p>Inside heaven, the priest went up to God and asked for an explination.</p>

<p>"Why God, why?  I have only done what you asked for all my life, and i have been a good person.  why did you not save me?"</p>

<p>And God replied:</p>

<p>"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK ALL THE DAMN BOATS WERE FOR THEN?!"</p>

<p>Think of it this way Mopar. The more jokes we create/copy-paste, the more words there are, and the more traffic will be driven to your website, which equals $$$$!!!</p>

<p>You like $$$ right? So let's get a new section, baby! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Jesus and Satan were having an argument as to who was the better programmer. This went on for days until they agreed to hold a contest with God as the judge. They sat at their computers and began.</p>

<p>They typed furiously for several hours, lines of code streaming up on the screen. Seconds before the end of the competition, a bolt of lightning struck, taking out the electricity. Moments later, the power was restored, and God announced that the contest was over. He asked Satan to show what he had come up with. Satan was visibly upset, and cried, "I have nothing! I lost it all when the power went out."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," God said, "Let us see if Jesus did any better."</p>

<p>Jesus entered a command, and the screen came to life in vivid display, the voices of an angelic choir poured forth from the speakers. Satan was astonished. He stuttered, "But how?! I lost everything, yet Jesus' program is intact! How did he do it?"</p>

<p>God chuckled, "Jesus saves"</p>
