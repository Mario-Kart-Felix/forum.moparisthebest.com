Every second the water was rising higher and higer, flowing into all the houses, and drowning many people.  But the priest had a plan.  He was going to pray to God to save him.
"Oh mightly Lord, i have only done what you wish all my life.  please save me from this flood."
Seconds passed, with the priest still hoping, but nothing happened.  A man in a boat came by and offered the priest a ride to safety.
"No," said the priest.  "God will save me."
He looked up again, and placed his hands together.
"Please God, have mercy on my soul."
Again, nothing spectacular happened.  A yatch came by, spotted the priest and the sailor offered the priest a ride to safety.
"No," the priest replied again.  "I have faith in my God.  He will save me."
The priest prayed for the last time.
"I beg of you.  Please save me God."
Minutes passed by with nothing happening.  Many more people passed the priest, some in boats, some in cruise ships, but the priest refused all of their offers, again saying that his God would save him.
The Water got too much, covered the priest and unfortunately he drowned.
Inside heaven, the priest went up to God and asked for an explination.
"Why God, why?  I have only done what you asked for all my life, and i have been a good person.  why did you not save me?"
And God replied:
"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK ALL THE DAMN BOATS WERE FOR THEN?!"</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>Two ints and a Float are in a bar. They spot an attractive Double on her own. The first int walks up to her. 'Hey, baby', he says, 'my VM or yours?'. She slaps him and he walks back dejected. The second int walks over. 'Hey, cute-stuff, can I cook your Beans for breakfast?'. After a quick slapping, he too walks back. The Float then ambles over casually. 'Were those two primitive types bothering you?', he remarks. 'Yes. I'm so glad you're here', she says. 'They just had no Class!'</p></blockquote></aside>
