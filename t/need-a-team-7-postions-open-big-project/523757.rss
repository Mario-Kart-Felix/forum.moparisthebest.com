    <title>Need A Team! 7 Postions Open. Big Project!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-team-7-postions-open-big-project/523757</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently looking for :

[ul][li]3 Programmers[/li]
[li]2-3 Graphic Designers (Create Custom Items/NPC)[/li]
[li]1 Web Developer [/li][/ul]
 
This will be a huge project because we are starting from a blank 474 server. There are a lot of ideas I have and hopefully you will as well. Once we have the team together I will describe all the details and ideas i have for the server, but till then it will remain unsaid to help not spread the ideas to other servers. As far as server cost go, I bought a IBM E server so we will be hosting it off that. So no need to worry about server costs. There will be a lot of work and we will all need to work as a team, so if your not good in team environments this is probably not for you :/

Feel free to contact me at [email]Inception.eScape@gmail.com[/email].

Make Sure to leave the following.

[ul][li]Name[/li]
[li]Field (Programmer, Graphic Design, Web Developer)[/li]
[li]Experience in field[/li]
[li]Why you should join the team?[/li][/ul]


Hope to meet you soon!
