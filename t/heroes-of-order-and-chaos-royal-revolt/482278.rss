    <description>Heroes Of Order and Chaos

Royal Revolt

I just love those two games. Looks childish, but it&#39;s whole loads of fun.

On Heroes Of Order And Chaos, it&#39;s a battle against Order And Chaos. You can play 3v3 Co-Op or 3v3 Pvp, or 3v3 solo. And 5v5 co-op and so on. You can use Free Heroes every week. There&#39;s no &quot;buy membership&quot;, You get the full content. BUT, you can buy gems.

Royal Revolt is a fun game in which you must get your rightful place on the throne. Your Auntie and Uncle (i think) steal the place. You and your army of: Knights, Rangers, Magers, Ballista&#39;s must defeat their soldiers through 42 levels with additional 10 or 11 levels. 

AMAZING.
