    <title>Maybe there is way</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/maybe-there-is-way/287062</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve been thinking, maybe there is a way to sell MoparScape items legally through your server. How you ask? If you made the model yourself. Technically, your selling [b]YOUR[/b] game model through a server you developed. You are not selling anything that is JaGex&#39;s property. 

Our models suck though, thats the problem, but there is a solution. You grab the 3d model of a God Sword for example, and build a replica of one, but not exactly the same. And there you go, you have your god sword model.  The only problem is, the specials, etc. So a god sword wouldn&#39;t be the best, but on most servers, people literally sell phats for real life money. Just make a party hat replica and we&#39;re all good.


What do you think?</description>
