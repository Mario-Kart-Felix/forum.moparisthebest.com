    <title>[718] So uhh dumb question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-so-uhh-dumb-question/554687</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to get a 718 client and server to connect but there&#39;s a error...

[code]error_game_js5connect[/code]

I&#39;m absolutely 100% sure i&#39;m missing something incredibly simple and before you say it...

1. Yes I changed the ip&amp;port to match the server.
2. Yes it has been CORRECTLY port forwarded.
3. Yes the cache is exactly where it needs to be and works fine.
4. Yes the revisions match for client and server.
5. Yes the port has been confirmed open and google can see the server service running.
6. Server is completely loaded b4 Client

A bit of additional information for some reason or another it works perfectly on 127.0.0.1
but fails to connect when hosted either by direct ip or no-ip.

And i set up a debug message to figure out where its attempting to connect to and when
the client does attempt a connection it does try the correct ip.

Debug messages also show a login was never attempted.

Note: This is in the server section because it deals with both client and server and cache and i had no idea where to stick it... And i know sk8r is about and he/she/they/it is awesome :)</description>

<p>You have to connect it like so:<br>
If the client and server are on the same machine: Localhost.<br>
If the client and server are on the same network, but different machines:  local address (the one you port forward with).<br>
If the client and server are on different networks: public address (see: <a href="http://ip4.me" rel="nofollow noopener">http://ip4.me</a> )</p>

I wonder why…</p>
<p>Out of mere curriosity…<br>
Is it something to do with the ports?<br>

Wait… Are you trying to login to the server, that’s running on localhost, via a client connecting to your IP? That won’t work, whatsoever.<br>
If the server is on the same pc as the client, you have to use localhost. Otherwise your pc tries to connect to the IP on the internet, and will never find it… because it’s your IP.</p>

<p>You really didn’t. You said to edit the char files, which the OP said couldn’t because they’re encoded in .dat format.</p>
<p>Are you sure you’re using the correct client/server pair? The client might be trying to read a value the server isn’t sending.</p>

<p>Besides if you can’t do the most basic things then your going to have problems and advising someone to learn a language before they try to build a empire on it isn’t such a bad idea…</p>
