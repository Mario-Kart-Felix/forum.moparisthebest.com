<p>Survival Games is a completely survival game.<br>
All players gets teleported to the map and spawns around the started loot.</p>
<p>A timer will begin, and count down from 10 to 0. Once the timer hits 0, players can attack each other.</p>
<p>The point is to survive, and be the last standing player.<br>
After the timer hits 0, people are able to move, and open the center chests.</p>
<p>The system will spawn random chests around the map. We have four types of chests.</p>
<p>Bronze, Maple, Gold, Treasure.</p>
<p>Treasure chest only spawns upon Treasure Drop, or at Final stages. There can be total of four Treasure Chests in the game.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Chesting</span></p>
<p>We have a very advanced chesting system, allows players to see what items there are, take them aswell. The chests are live, means anyone can take items at the same time, the first to click gets the item he selected.</p>
<p>We also have implemented a very nice chest interface aswell.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Treasure Drop</span></p>
<p>Treasure drop is a situation where a 10x10 place spawns anywhere in the map, and gets announced. The Treasure Drop contains 2 Gold chests, 1 Treasure chest, and 4 Maple chests.<br>
There will only be two Treasure Drops in the tournament.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Servers</span></p>
<p>After the game starts, you will have to wait for the game to end, but don’t worry! We have multiple servers to offer you with automatic server switching.</p>
