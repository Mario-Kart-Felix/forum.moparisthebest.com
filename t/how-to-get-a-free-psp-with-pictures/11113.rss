How To Get Free PSP![/u][/size]

Introduction:

I have gotten a ton of messages from people asking me if my signature about getting free real PSPs is true, so I thought I would make a little TUT :)

This is a pretty simple TUT, just follow every single step and in no-time you will have a free PSP (Or PS2 or $250, whatever you want!) in your hands! Anyways...

Steps:

1. Open a new browser (If using IE) or open a new tab (if using FF).

2. In your new browser or tab copy &amp; paste this in the address bar: http://www.freeplaystations.com/?ref=78LV11

3. Sign up with the site.

Make sure you click on the item you want.

4. After signing up go to Members Login.

5. After you’re logged in, go to Offers. If you have already completed your offer it will say continue to referral page.

6. Now here’s the part where it gets tricky. Most of the offers you have to complete say there free, but there’s always a catch. The only offer you can do which would cost you practically nothing is Video Professor.

If you want you can do some of the other offers but I haven’t tried half of them because at the end they ask for money Lol.

7. After you completed your offer (may take 1-3 days to register on the site) continue to the referral page.

Conclusion:

Now if you’re the decent and honest type like me then you would just post your referral link in your signature or something close. You must wait till 5 people go to your link, sign up and complete an offer. Or if you’re the cheating type, you would get 5 different proxies, click on your link 5 different times with those 5 different proxy and complete steps 1-6, simple. On the FreePlayStation.com site don’t forget to read the &quot;How it works&quot; and &quot;Faq&quot; sections. 

If you have any feedback or questions don’t be shy to post it here :) 
Enjoy your new PSP  :)


*Edit*
I took out the [TUT] in my title  ;)

*Edit2*
Oh and everyone I got pictures of my PSP, take a look.
Sorry I didn&#39;t post this earlier, but seeing as I dont have a camera or web cam-it wasn&#39;t possible for me. This is everything I got for free (I not only got a free PSP, I also got 2 games; Prince Of Persia and Lumines-It was a different offer then) back then.

Heres a closer look:

*Edit3* 
Oh and everyone please excuse Drunk On Java and his bamblings about this being fake, hes a proven liar. I assure you that this is real and that [b]I have already gotten my free PSP[/b].

My hotmail account, I have had in 2 years and got literally 3.6 million unread messages. From tons of newbies here on the forum and ads etc.

Funny thing that&#39;s CRAP.

If each email was 1kb (I&#39;m being wayy fair here, they are each about 2-3kb), and multiply that by 3,600,000 that would equal around 3515mb

Hotmail only offers 250mb. zomghax[/quote]

I have been to it before. Tons of ads, this is probably a hoax. I mean you have to have 5 people do it before you get it? F that.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>First of all, if you actually have freinds, just simply tell them to do the same FREE offer you did over msn/aim.<br>
second, it’ll only work in the US, cos it when trying to sign up for that video professer, even though it actually says ‘zip/<span class="bbcode-b">POSTAL CODE</span>’ it doesnt let you write a postal code as it’s to the US only.<br>
would probably work if i were american <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
good guide.</p>
<p>PS you gotta pay for postage ;[/quote]</p>
<p>Maybe they already did it for my PSP?</p>
<p>Anyways I can’t believe this thread is still up. Well it doesn’t matter because I already got my PS2. I don’t care what people have to say because the purpose of this thread was fulfilled.</p>
<p>And Avistetto, I know the rules, I have been here much longer then you. It doesn’t matter if I post a referral link or not, it takes you to the same page. But if your going to be like that then so be it.</p>
<p>If I see anymore spam/flame about this topic then I will close it. Theres no reason why a couple of poor kids who can’t afford shipping should wreck this for the kids who can. Would you rather pay $200 for it at your local Walmart, or $10 for just the shipping.</p>
<h2>So again, anymore spamming/flaming and this thread will be closed.</h2>
<p>Oh and Thank you to all the people who signed up and got me my free PS2 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
