Yes, I know people are going to say &quot;assassin&#39;s creed much?&quot; but they&#39;re using their own engine that they have been developing for years. I pre-ordered the game ages ago, can&#39;t wait for it to finally release Sept. 30  :D. There is loads of gameplay videos on Youtube from E3 and other companies asking them to showcase the domincation system, etc.

My only bitch is that they already have DLC and a season pass announced, which pisses me off. Really hoping the game is as fully developed as they&#39;re promising if they&#39;re going to announce DLC a month before the game&#39;s release.
