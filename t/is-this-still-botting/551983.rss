    <title>Is this still &quot;Botting&quot;?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-this-still-botting/551983</link>
    <description>EDIT:
TL;DR: I&#39;m using a servo to simulate clicks on runescape. Is this bannable?

Before I start, I want to be clear that I&#39;m basing all of this off of [url=http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Macroing_and_third-party_software]Macroing and third party software[/url].

On there, it generally says you can&#39;t use software to gain an advantage on the game. So no using literal bots like Pbot or epic (Not saying full names just in case)..

You also can&#39;t modify the game client to cheat for you.. That&#39;s sort f (Not 100% exactly) what the bots I mentioned above do.. to an extent.


Well.. What if I use this method:
[url=http://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/2pnepx/hefin_agility_course_without_moving_mouse/cmyg85y]Hefin agility Course with 1 click[/url]

Along with one of these things:
[img]http://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/ArduinoUno_r2_front450px.jpg[/img]
And this:
[img height=300]http://www.conrad.com/medias/global/ce/2000_2999/2000/2090/2090/209089_LB_00_FB.EPS_1000.jpg[/img]
(Yes, the white things too)


This is the idea (Already tested and etc etc).

I write up a script in the arduino IDE to control the servo. The server moves the white &quot;Arm&quot; (Those plastic things in pic above) down to simulate a mouse click. As it is LITERALLY CLICKING THE MOUSE, there&#39;s no way to detect that it&#39;s not me inputting the click.
The next step is/was to write in delays for each part of the Hefin course. I haven&#39;t done this, but the longest part of it is 11 seconds.

Basically, what I&#39;m doing is making a timer for the servo to click (I&#39;ma try and add in a randomized time to the delay, to make it seem more human) on the specified part of the Hefin course. As that one spot makes it possible for me to consistently do laps..

The reason this works, is because I&#39;m on a laptop. While it will work just fine on a desktop, laptops have the mouse buttons that are stationary. So if you do this on a desktop, you will need to find a way to hold the mouse still as your servo will use enough force to slide the mouse, not only preventing it from clicking, but also losing the one click agility spot.


But. Is this &quot;Safe&quot;? Like, could they decide to somehow ban me for running countless laps on the hefin course? I&#39;m not seeing how they would be able to detect that I&#39;m doing this, as I plug the arduino in to my pc only when I&#39;m running the IDE to write code for it, not like they&#39;d even know what I&#39;m using the arduino for. After that it runs on a seperate power supply.. So there&#39;s no way to detect that I&#39;m sending &quot;false input&quot;.
The only thing that could get me in trouble for doing what I&#39;m saying (I BELIEVE) is... This post here. But am I wrong?</description>

I don’t know their exact way of doing this but I’m sure they revealed some details as to how they did it when they did the bot nuke thing. Along with that they also said that new bots could circumvent their detection methods and new bot busting methods would be implemented as the bots adapted. This was several years back, I’m pretty sure they’ve got most if not all ways of botting mapped out by now.</p>

I’m not understanding how they’d “detect” it being botted vs it being me clicked.<br>
The clicking patterns that I’d be demonstrating using the microcontroller are the exact same clicking patterns that’d be used when I actually run the prif course.<br>
I’ll get the course sometimes as a daily challenge, which requires 20+ runs usually. All I do is set my screen up so I can do the one click run method, and then do it.<br>
The only difference is that there’s a piece of plastic that’s triggered by a semi-random timer clicking, instead of me.</p>
<p>To be clear I’m not saying “It’s not bannable” here. I’m saying, I don’t get how they would register the difference.</p>

I’ve done the course many times… Before I even thought about using my microcontroller, without moving the mouse a single pixel.<br>
You want to know how that’s possible? I have a laptop.<br>
I set the mouse into position. And then I click the button. I never have to touch my trackpad again, so the mouse doesn’t move again. Whether on purpose or on accident.</p>

Not just saying because they checked software.<br>
I’m wondering if they<br>
A) Noticed he was clicking the exact same pixel for X hours…<br>
B) Noticed his mouse rarely (If at all) moved.<br>
C) Player reports<br>
D) A combination of the above.<br>
So get your snarky attitude out of here.</p>

<p>I’d assume the reason they busted him is because he was around other players… Which means they see him there for 6+ hours.<br>
And like I said, people love to screw with seren stone miners. I’ve seen countless posts about seren stone auto clickers being lured to their death, and then looted.</p>

The first line of their rules page for Third Party Software is pretty spot-on about this…</p>
<aside class="quote">
<blockquote>
<p>Software that can be used to gain an unfair advantage in our games may not be used. This includes automation tools, macros, bots, auto-typers and any other tools that circumvent any of our mechanisms designed to automatically log out inactive users.</p>

</aside>
<p>You as a player, is not moving, clicking, or otherwise messing with the mouse yourself and allowing a third party to do so itself - for you. I’d say that it’d still warrant a ban should you be caught. Are you going to be caught with something like this? I don’t know, maybe you won’t even be looked at in the first place. Their rule, however, is pretty spot-on about it though.<br>
