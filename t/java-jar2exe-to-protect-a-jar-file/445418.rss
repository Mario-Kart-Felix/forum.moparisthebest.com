    <title>[Java] Jar2exe to protect a JAR file</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-jar2exe-to-protect-a-jar-file/445418</link>
    <description>How well does Jar2exe actually protect a JAR file from modification?

Say you make your JAR, obfuscate it, and then add make it an exe with Jar2exe, how easily could you get the code and/or modify it?

What Jar2exe offers:
[code]Encrypted java program will not generate temporary files when runs:
    Comparing with other encrypt tools, the encrypted java program by this software will not generate temporary files when runs. So, the protected java program could not be gotten by monitoring disk I/O.[/code]

[code]Generated exe files can encrypt and protect java programs, no temporary files will be generated when program runs. [/code]

<p>i was talking about specifically gcj in relation to the concept.[/quote]ok, but we’re still stuck with the problem of gcj’s library’s limitations and how one might have to resort to ‘portable’ native libraries in certain scenarios. despite this, GCJ seems kinda dead anyway (excelsior jet really is a better alternative)</p>

<p>That actually takes the java source code or class files containing bytecode, converts it assembly and assembles it to object code just like gcc does with C source code.

<p>Jar2Exe using the “hide” mechanism instead places the archive in a type 10 RCDATA resource, which is somehow processed prior to being fed through the ZipArchive library for unpacking.<br>
The encryption option merely adds an additional layer to this hide mechanism by employing a homebrew stream cipher named XOR256 to the data. XOR256 used to be documented <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1261/XOR256-Stream-Encryption-with-Arcfour-PRNG" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, but as you can see the page is suspended, likely because the code went proprietary. You can find it here, however:<br>
<a href="https://scenarioframework.svn.codeplex.com/svn/src/Scenario%20Libraries/cppbOSCrypto/Crypto/bOSXOR256Stream.h" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://scenarioframework.svn.codeplex.com/svn/src/Scenario%20Libraries/cppbOSCrypto/Crypto/bOSXOR256Stream.h</a><br>

<p>That all being said, all of these techniques can be readily defeated using a JVM debugging agent.</p>

No, this is a client of a rsps that is ‘converted’ to .exe.<br>

I believe that will suffice? It’s an example of a windows GUI application. It comes with the regular JAR, an exe, a console exe, and the class files.</p>

              <p>How well does Jar2exe actually protect a JAR file from modification?</p>
<p>Say you make your JAR, obfuscate it, and then add make it an exe with Jar2exe, how easily could you get the code and/or modify it?</p>
<p>What Jar2exe offers:</p>
<p><code>Encrypted java program will not generate temporary files when runs:
    Comparing with other encrypt tools, the encrypted java program by this software will not generate temporary files when runs. So, the protected java program could not be gotten by monitoring disk I/O.</code></p>
