    <title>Msn Was Hacked: Possible virus?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/msn-was-hacked-possible-virus/385708</link>
    <description>My MSN: Marcisboss@hotmail.com was hacked and the guy changed all the information and stuff. I even just found out today he tried to add several hacked credit cards to my paypal account and paypal ended up limiting it.

This brings up 2 questions:

1) I think I have some kind of keylogger on my computer. AVG and AntiMalewarebites doesnt show anything. What should I use?

2) Whats a good technique to recover my msn? I am currently in the recover process but the guy changed all the information so basically the only thing that I was able to input was my IP so hopefully they can see that 99% of the connections made on it were from my IP</description>
