    <title>Hard Drive Not Exist</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hard-drive-not-exist/371587</link>
    <description>I bought a new laptop less than two weeks ago and I&#39;ve been using it without any problems until today. I was watching a video, as I usually do, and the laptop suddenly crashed. After turning it on again it gave me this screen with the following information: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Boot Device Not Found

Please install an operating system on your hard disk

Hard Disk - (3F0)

F2 System Diagnostics

For more information, please visit www.hp.com/go/techcenter/startup&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Like I said, the laptop is brand new and the operating system is Windows 7. I just can&#39;t understand what could&#39;ve caused this. The diagnosis tool in the BIOS can&#39;t find the hard drive, or any drive for that matter, nor does a Ubuntu live cd boot (I changed boot orders, didn&#39;t help). In addition, the laptop keeps making this clicking sound, as if something&#39;s not quite right. You know when you put in a CD in the cd drive and it&#39;s not fully attached to the ring that holds it? Bad explanation but meh, if you know anything, please help.

EDIT: The diagnosis tool does really say &quot;Hard Drive Not Exist&quot;

EDIT2: I finally got the laptop back after well over a month&#39;s wait, and it turns out the motherboard was borked. They fixed the issue and now everything&#39;s back to normal, thanks for the help.</description>

UPDATE:</p>
<p>The new hard drive along with the recovery disks HP sent me arrived today. I had the HDD replaced and started installing Win7, however, the clicking sound remains. The installation process says that the estimated completion time is 85 minutes BUT IT GETS STUCK AT 3% and doesn’t move no matter how long I wait. What on earth could the problem possibly be if it’s not the hard drive? I’m pretty sure it’s not the fans because they’re working fine. FYI, the clicking is coming from the upper right corner of the laptop (number pad etc). I already sent HP an email regarding the issue and I’m eagerly waiting for a response.<br>

<p>Is it the CD-ROM?[/quote]I’m not sure, perhaps. Before any of this happened I was using the cd-drive normally, listening to songs etc. and everything was working as it should be. I tried installing win7 on it again just now and it seems the CD starts spinning a little bit but then stops completely and ends up making a sound as if it’s stuck or something, in addition to the clicking. After I took the CD out it had some scratches on the upper side for some reason (cds are all brand new). Also, I don’t understand how a “broken” cd drive could affect the laptop as a whole.</p>

              <p>It sounds like the read/write heads have crashed into the platter.  This is very dangerous as it (as you noticed) can stop the hard drive spinning up, also if used much more then it will scratch the platters and destroy all your data.

<p>Bad hard drives have a tendency to act like that sometimes, I’d backup anything important to you right away and still take it back, once that happens it WILL happen again.</p>
