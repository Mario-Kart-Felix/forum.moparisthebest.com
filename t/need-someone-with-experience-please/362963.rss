              <p>Right click your .bat and select ‘edit’, now once you have done that a text document should of opened.</p>
<p>You should see something along the lines of,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">start javaw -Xmx500m -cp .;Theme.jar Gui</code></pre>
<p>You will want to change the, <code>start javaw</code> to this,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">"C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe"</code></pre>
<p>Or to your Javas file location.</p>
<p>Now for an alternative, you can download a .bat to .exe converter and convert your current .bat to a .exe. It should work fine after you complete one of those above. Good luck hun.</p>
