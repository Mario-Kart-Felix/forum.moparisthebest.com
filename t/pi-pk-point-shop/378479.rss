    <description>Here&#39;s my problems.

My PK point shop has prices that range from 50 points - 300 points.

When you value an item it says the correct price, but when you go to buy it, it says you do not have enough PK points. For an item that should be 50 points, it costs 1,000,000 points. How do I fix that?</description>
