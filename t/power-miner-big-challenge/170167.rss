    <title>Power miner BIG CHALLENGE</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/power-miner-big-challenge/170167</link>
    <description>Hello.

I am looking for a script that find iron ores at the mines south of Falador, mine them, but only when they come back, not when they are empy, based on color. You should not have to wield anything, or wear anything, just click run. Once the ores are mined, your character will drop spaces 2-28, leaving space one sill there. The clicks should be random, so that jagex doesn&#39;t detect you. (i meant, at different times, not different locations...)

The reason I made this topic is to get a miner that can automaticly repond to people talking to your character, set off by &quot;key&quot; words.
If your name was lolzers...

[ul]1. your response to your name, or part of your name, lolzers would be: hi, sup, sup man, hello, hola, wats goin on, etc.
2. your response to hi, sup, sup man, hello, hola, wats goin on, etc., would be...hi, sup, sup man, hello, hola, wats goin on, etc., but not the same one they asked you.

Much more detail then what I put.


If you are getting te general idea, then please help. The phrases need to sound like you screw up sometimes, and also that the program doesn&#39;t instantly say it, or type it, it has to be the speed of a human, not a superhuman.

This should be anti-random.

P.S. - If someone were to ask your mining level, is there a way to &quot;auto-detect&quot; your level, then say... &quot;mines 47&quot; ???
P.S.S. - The chat answers need to be in depth, not just, &quot;hey&quot;
P.S.S.S - I see only one problem with my whole theory. Your name is going to have to be put in the scipt, so that it knows who you are, and so that it can respond to your name. Maybe a window that asks for your name, the level you are trying to reach, the time it will take (most likely it wil not be acurate 100%)[/ul]</description>

Just read tutorials.  It may not always be the most fun method, but they work.</p>

              <p>p.s.1: yes<br>
p.s.3: It is simple to make the ‘username’ a variable that you enter into a form when the script is started.</p>
<p>This actually isnt that difficult, and I’m sure people have already worked on some and implemented them into checking for randoms / anti-ban.  Its a pretty easy concept.<br>
If I remember correctly, there was a [very] large script written for aryan which had this.</p>
<p>Just learn to script a bit, then do it yourself.  It would really be a waste to put a large AI together and release it to a whole community.  You could probably write it all by yourself with about 1 weeks training.</p>
<p>If you want to, you could find a good miner that works for you, then (after asking for permission :P) add your file as if it were a srl include.  Just place it into an anti-ban procedure or call it up every few ores.</p>
