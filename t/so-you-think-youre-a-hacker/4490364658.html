it was more on the accused difficulty of UI design in swing.</p>
<p>in regards to VB being bad: VB programmers do not focus on useful programming paradigms, instead they rely on wizards and bloated tools. the development process turns in to a mindless copy/paste and doesn’t focus on the underlying implementations. VB is also a simple language (not that there’s anything wrong with that), but it’s meant for elementary programmers… ie, what a grade school would push. based on the aforementioned, i would say VB is only a shit language because of its userbase and its values.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BSD, Lunix, Debian and Mandrake are all versions of an illegal hacker operation system, invented by a Soviet computer hacker named Linyos Torovoltos, before the Russians lost the Cold War. It is based on a program called “xenix”, which was written by Microsoft for the US government. These programs are used by hackers to break into other people’s computer systems to steal credit card numbers. They may also be used to break into people’s stereos to steal their music, using the “mp3” program. Torovoltos is a notorious hacker, responsible for writing many hacker programs, such as “telnet”, which is used by hackers to connect to machines on the internet without using a telephone.</p>
