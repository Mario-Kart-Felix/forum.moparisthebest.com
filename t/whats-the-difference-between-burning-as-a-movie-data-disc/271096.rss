    <title>What&#39;s the difference between burning as a movie/data disc?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-the-difference-between-burning-as-a-movie-data-disc/271096</link>
    <description>Today I wanted to burn Yes Man to a dvd so I can watch it tonight. So I start ashampoo, and select &quot;burn a movie from a prepared folder&quot;. That&#39;s what I always do. But it fails to do so. It comes up with a media error, which I can fix by using a different brand of dvds, using a lower burning speed (Doh!, on my laptop the max is 2x), updating my firmware etc... So after having to throw away 3 dvd&#39;s I decide to try and burn it as a data disc. I use the same prepared folder (containing .vob files) and it works! 

So I&#39;m wondering: what&#39;s the difference between burning it as a movie disc and as a data disc?</description>

              <p>So my problem lies in the fact that somehow the burning software fucks up the formatting? I tried it on my laptop and my desktop, and both gave me the same error.</p>
<p>Oh well, I got to see Yes Man, so my night wasn’t wasted completely.</p>

              <p>A movie disc you can watch on a DVD player and whatnot, with a data disc, all if does is burn the source files on it, it doesn’t format the disc so you can watch it on your TV or other devices.</p>

              <p>Your DVD Player is oviously pretty good and can read data disc’s while older appliances can only play movie disk.<br>
Data Disks keep the movie in files while Movie disks are written so the laser can easily read the movie in sequence like a record player (accept a bit more complicated)</p>
