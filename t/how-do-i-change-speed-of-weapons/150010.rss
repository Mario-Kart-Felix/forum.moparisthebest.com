    <title>How Do I Change Speed of Weapons?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-change-speed-of-weapons/150010</link>
    <description>I figured out how to change the speed of my weapons when attack other players, this is what it looks like
[code]else
{
PkingDelay = 10;
wepdelay = 10;
}  [/code]
I found that under public boolean attack

But, that only changes &#39;attack other players&#39;, How do I change the weapon speed of attacking NPCs?

Thanks,
