    <title>NPC Speak help</title>

    <description>Ok. I have the Allstar Scape source... and I&#39;ve seen this is a big problem for lots of people.. I can&#39;t get the Genies or ANY npc in the game to change what they say.

I went into npchandler.java and changed the Genies to say &quot;Welcome to myserver&quot;. I saved then compiled. I then ran my server and they still said &quot;Welcome to AllstarScape&quot;

I know I compiled right because it said all files compiled correctly and I can change other stuff in the server, but not what NPCs say.. Any help please?



EDIT: NEVER MIND :D There was an error in my coding in client.java and because of the error, it never FULLY compiled. Once I fixed the errors it fully compiled and it worked :D</description>
