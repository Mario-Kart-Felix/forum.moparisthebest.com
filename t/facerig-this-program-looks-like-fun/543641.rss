    <title>FaceRig - This program looks like fun</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/facerig-this-program-looks-like-fun/543641</link>
    <description>For years, as I&#39;ve grown up with the internet I&#39;ve always wanted to &quot;cosplay&quot; online as characters. Like in a video chat, others would see you as your favorite RPG character, or one of the LoL characters. And when you&#39;d talk, your voice would be emulated to that of the characters (Assuming it had some form of voice).

I always thought I&#39;d need some green screen, and a bunch of high tech. like they do with Star Wars (the newest one), or plenty other movies.

Soon, it won&#39;t be. A team of developers started working on a project some time ago (idk when they officially started) called &quot;FaceRig&quot;. When they started their Indiegogo campaign, it was a slow beginning for them. Eventually, they had gone viral, and soon they exploded with donations (Sadly that time frame is over, you can no longer donate on the indiegogo page). Now that the product is nearing beta (It&#39;s in like August) I&#39;m just getting more and more anxious (as I was one of the backers to the project) for it&#39;s release.

Are you guys ready to see me in Skype as some random creatures? Because I know I am:
https://facerig.com/

Note: it&#39;s unknown if they will actually have skype support. But I&#39;d love it 1000x more if they did.

Here&#39;s some media if you didn&#39;t go to the site above:
