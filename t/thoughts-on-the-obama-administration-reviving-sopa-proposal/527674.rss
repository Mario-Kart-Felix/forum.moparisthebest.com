    <title>Thoughts on The Obama Administration Reviving SOPA Proposal</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thoughts-on-the-obama-administration-reviving-sopa-proposal/527674</link>
    <description>So with all the hype about SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) a few months ago, it seemed like everything stopped and went back to normal. Until I was reading down the news headlines and saw this article: [url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/07/unauthorized-streaming-felony_n_3720479.html]Obama Administration Revives SOPA Proposal To Make Unauthorized Streaming A Felony[/url].

Unauthorized streaming would be a crime! Think about it. Think about all of the every-day tutorials for virtually [i]anything [/i]that you can find on YouTube. All of that would be gone. YouTube would either close their site, or remove most videos, except those who have legal permission (such as music videos, VEVO). How do you guys think this will change the internet and will it effect you, personally? 

I think [i]YouTube [/i]will become like [i]google [/i]or other file-sharing sites where they get a server in a different country. (Ex. YouTube.eu)

Thoughts? Discuss. 

* I wasn&#39;t completely sure if this falls into Intellectual Discussions and Debates, it involves politics and legalities. So excuse me if it doesn&#39;t. 

** Let me also throw in, before people start saying &quot;You are a just stupid republican and you just don&#39;t like Obama.&quot;, I&#39;m not Republican, or Democrat. I have nothing against Obama. I have something against the whole government though. (Survivalist Egoist-Anarchism)</description>

              <p>Almost everything about your post is incorrect. What they mean by unauthorized streaming, is that you can’t stream content that you do not own/not authorized by the owner. This is ALREADY the law. So if you make a tutorial for something and post it on youtube, that is just fine because you own it.</p>
<p>Youtube relocating servers to countries without copyright laws will never happen. youtube is estimated to have between 50,000 to 1,000,000 servers. They can function and profit better by following the laws. Nothing will change besides the fact that law enforcement will be able to remove copyright content quicker and easier than before and block americans from connecting to whichever sites they don’t like.</p>
<p>.eu is just the domain name and has nothing to do with where servers are located.</p>
<p>So as I said your concern about not being able to stream unauthorized content is already a real law. This bill is basically going to force websites to be responsible for their users and what their users post/upload. Law enforcement will be able to shut down access to any site violating copyright laws and also ban them from advertising networks.</p>
