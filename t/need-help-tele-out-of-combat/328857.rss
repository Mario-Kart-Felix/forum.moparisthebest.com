<p>As for removing equipment, there is a packet ( Don’t know it for 562.)</p>
<p>Find it in the client, write a server sided method for it. Use it to remove the equipment into your inventory and then do the same thing. Then you need to   use the packet for creating ground items (use the one in your drop item if you have that working.)</p>
<p>Btw, I don’t think you need to use the remove equipment method, you can just probably loop through equipment too and delete it and then just use the drop method to make the equipment appear on the ground.</p>
