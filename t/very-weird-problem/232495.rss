    <title>Very weird problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/very-weird-problem/232495</link>
    <description>okay, i made my own server and i could log in fine
but once some1 else logs into my server and i log out then everytime i try to log in it goes like its ganna log in but it goes black and says loading please wait then it goes to the log in screen saying error conecting to server
and then i try again and it says account loged in please wait 60 seconds and  i waited like 30 mins and it still said that
and then i went to another acc and got on and when i am in the server the npc that says the owner is offline/online says that the account is online but it isnt were it last was
the only way i have been able to fix this was buy deleting the owner account and then making it again and making him owner again
but now the npc says its offline even when im online its very annoying
but then once some1 else gets on and i log off i does it again
so im kinda tired of making my acc over again everytime some1 logs on

any1 know what to do??</description>
