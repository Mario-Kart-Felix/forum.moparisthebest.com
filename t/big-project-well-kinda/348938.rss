    <description>I know how to code but lately i have been in HTML creating a loader to read if you have voted once you have voted it generates a code and sends to your email. Then that code is used to get your item. But the thing is i need a code ingame but what would it be A ::pickup commands with &#39;This can only be used once a day&#39; &#39;Please try again in 23 hours&#39;

And i was thinking for the code generator it is hosted online but the codes sources from a folder like &#39;Charecters&#39; it updates itself everytime someone creates an account . But i want to change that to codes and for it to terminate itself so it can&#39;t be used again . 

We have really good Coders here Please help me :]</description>
