    <title>How do i use moparscape servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-use-moparscape-servers/231632</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve searched all over the furoms and i would like to know how to use someones server. I do not want i guide on making one (there are plenty of those) I just want to know how to use one that has been set up. I downloaded all their stuff and unzipped it, but i have no idea how to use it. Right now all i have is a bunch of computer data and no game . So could someone please direct to a tutorial or just explain on this thread how to use servers. (you&#39;ll have to be patience i&#39;m completly new to this kind of thing)

I was told this as the correct place to post this.

Also, would anyone tell my how to find out what kind of router i have?</description>

              <p>[quote=“elyad, post:4, topic:231632”]I suggest you look at my previous post’s, This should help you a great deal.</p>
<p>Well, This thread may stop all the pointless posts &amp; demands for tutorials flooding the forums, So Im just going to add a few tutorials ive posted in the past week or so, Please add to it with any tutorials you may see on the forums and il update the list. Evrey little helps i guess, Least now people can scroll down the topic and see if the help they need is listed all in one thread. I doubt it will do any good, but may cut back a few pointless posts.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How to setup basic RSC Private Server using demonik/Divinepk 5.0 Source.</span></p>
<p>First of all <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.google.com</a></p>
<p>Download Apache Ant, Wamp, JDK &amp; You need to PORT FORWARD, Port 43595 &amp; 80 Only if using Router, Go into Control Panel - Network connections, Right Click on Local Area Connection, Selet Status, Click the Support Tab on top, And click the ‘‘details’’ Button. Get your Default Gateway Adress and type this into your Browsers address bar, Then look for something like games/application sharing? It can vary. And Figure your way round port forwarding.If you get stuck, may i suggest to you <a href="http://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm</a> &amp; select your router from the list. Now…</p>
<p>Place the Apache Ant folder into your C:/</p>
<p>Install Wamp &amp; JDK</p>
<p>Now you will need an RSC Server Source, I’ll suggest Demonik/Divine 5.0 for beginners.</p>
<p>Here’s the download link - <a href="http://uppit.com/WY362S" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uppit.com/WY362S</a></p>
<p>Now with the source file you just download Divine 5.0.rar, Right click and extract it.</p>
<p>Now find your divine 5.0 folder, and inside it go into MysqlDatabase folder, In here there should be a .txt file named demonik_lsd. Remember that for a second.</p>
<p>Now if you have installed wamp correctly, Goto start menu and run wamp server, A little half clock dial image should appear on your taskbar next to your clock? Left click on this and select from the list phpMyadmin. It should load a webpage in your browser, iexplore or mozilla depending what you use? Now towards the bottom of this page theres a list of selections in blue font, select ‘‘import’’ Now it will load another page in your browser, now this is where you need to upload the demonik_lsd file, so click browse and find your demonik_lsd file. Then scroll down and click the ‘‘go’’ button. Ok now that is your database uploaded and ready.</p>
<p>Now for your website files so your able to register an account to login with. Go into your divine 5.0 folder again, there should be a folder named ‘‘www’’ copy this folder. Now goto My computer - C:/ - wamp. There should already be a www folder here? Delete it and paste the 1 you have just copied from Divine 5.0 folder. That is your website ready. Now to register.</p>
<p>Ok now on your taskbar, left click the wamp clock/dial icon again and select from the list localhost. This will load in your browser your website page, Then obviously, select register on the webpage and register an account for yourself to login with.</p>
<p>Ok now to run the server, Go into your Divine 5.0 folder and then into ‘‘Server’’ folder, you should see a file called run.bat? Right click on this and select ‘‘edit’’ You will see this.<code>set PATH=%PATH%;C:\apache-ant-1.7.0\bin
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program\Java\jdk1.6.0_04
ant demonikp2p</code></p>
<p>Now what you need to do is edit these, to where your java path is and your ant path is, so for e.g where you placed your apache ant folder, go into untill u get to the directory ‘’ C:\apache-ant-1.7.0\bin ‘’ and same with the java, C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06. Just edit the text from C:\ on wards, do not change the set PATH= etc…</p>
<p>Once this is done, its time to run the client. Go into your Divine 5.0 folder once again, Go into the ‘‘client’’ folder and there should be a divinepk client.rar file? Right click and ‘‘extract here’’ Now when you have done this, go into the divinepk client folder. And double click the ‘‘run.bat’’ it will begin to load, type your username and password you registerd with on website and change the server number from 1 to 2. VERY IMPORTANT.</p>
<p>If this didnt help, ive no idea what will. :S Hope it did though. Dayle.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">How to edit item stats/aim/power etc…</span></p>
<p>Ok, Go into your Divinepk 5.0 folder, Conf, defs, extras.</p>
<p>Now Right click on ItemWieldableDef.xml, click ‘‘open with’’ select word pad or notepad, any txt editor you like.</p>
<p><code>		&lt;ItemWieldableDef&gt;
			&lt;sprite&gt;118&lt;/sprite&gt;
			&lt;type&gt;16&lt;/type&gt;
			&lt;wieldPos&gt;4&lt;/wieldPos&gt;
			&lt;armourPoints&gt;0&lt;/armourPoints&gt;
			&lt;weaponAimPoints&gt;8&lt;/weaponAimPoints&gt;
			&lt;weaponPowerPoints&gt;6&lt;/weaponPowerPoints&gt;
			&lt;magicPoints&gt;0&lt;/magicPoints&gt;
			&lt;prayerPoints&gt;0&lt;/prayerPoints&gt;
			&lt;rangePoints&gt;0&lt;/rangePoints&gt;
			&lt;requiredStats&gt;
			&lt;/requiredStats&gt;
			&lt;femaleOnly&gt;false&lt;/femaleOnly&gt;
		&lt;/ItemWieldableDef&gt;</code></p>
<p>Now you will see this, edit which stats of an item you would like, e.g weapon aim? Then were it says ‘‘8’’ Change the number from eight to whatever you would like. Now save and close this.</p>
<p>You will need a compression tool now, Here. <a href="http://uppit.com/4EP68J" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uppit.com/4EP68J</a></p>
<p>In this there will be an input folder, place your edited itemwieldabledef.xml into this, then go back and double click the compress all.bat now go into the output folder and u will now have an itemwieldabledef.xml.gz. Right click on copy this file.</p>
<p>Now go back to your server folder, and delete the itemwieldabledef.xml and itemwieldabledef.xml.gz and paste the new itemwieldabledef.xml.gz, right click and extract it. Now go and run your server, and your items stats will be edited.</p>

That to a moparscaper would be like asking someone what 55664455X3455453= equals in under three seconds.<br>
There not going to get it.</p>

I do not want i guide on making one (there are plenty of those) I just want to know how to use one that has been set up. I downloaded all their stuff and unzipped it, but i have no idea how to use it. Right now all i have is a bunch of computer data and no game . So could someone please direct to a tutorial or just explain on this thread how to use servers. (you’ll have to be patience i’m completly new to this kind of thing)</p>
<p>I was told this as the correct place to post this.</p>
<p>Also, would anyone tell my how to find out what kind of router i have?</p>
