    <title>Help with client crash</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-client-crash/546219</link>
    <description>Hey guys. A Little new here but Need some help. I have downloaded about 3-4 client/sources and all the clients have crashed. I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with the Java path as the server is working fine. Here are some screenshots that may help you diagnose the problem.

There is the client compiler.  There seems to be a few warnings in there.  I don&#39;t know if that is what is contributing to the problem as I am very new to the server coding area.  I am starting a test server so I can learn the basics.

That&#39;s what I get when I run the client.

I hope this can be sorted out.  I can print screen any code you need to look at etc.</description>

<p>whats your ip set to in loader.java, port also.</p>
<p>if your trying to run in localhost  put it to 127.0.0.1 port 43594</p>
<p>if that fails, you probably have the wrong client and should use foxtrots client<br>
just google it.</p>
<p>could be your cache too but then again you wouldn’t have been able to run the server.</p>
<p>but justincase i guess, make sure its in the data folder.   SERVER\data\cache</p>
