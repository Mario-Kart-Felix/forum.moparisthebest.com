    <title>[Help Please] Quest Tab + Clickable Cmds</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-please-quest-tab-clickable-cmds/340853</link>
    <description>Mkay guys this has been annoying me because I cant figure it out. lol

This is regarding the quest tab.

My server has a text lets say &quot;Achievement Diary&quot; its in the quest tab where the quests usually go. And when I click it, it replaces the quest tab with, say, another quests tab with the achievement diary stuff on it.

I want to be able to make another text like that in the quests tab but called &quot;Commands List&quot; So when I click it, it will bring up a new quests tab of commands that I will have in there to give items when you click it, like &quot;barrows&quot; etc.

Problem: Is pretty much I dont know how to make a clickable text that will bring up a new quest interface without all the quests on it + A clickable text that will give items.

Can anyone help explain how to do this?

Im using a palidino76 508 source, if that helps. Thanks!</description>
