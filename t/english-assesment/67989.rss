    <description>This is what is says on the sheet

This is an Across the Board assessment task that will form part of your Yearly Assessment.
It will be marked by one teacher so it is very important to ensure your name and the name of your
teacher is clearly marked on your assignment.
This sheet must be attached to your assignment for marking purposes.
TASK
On ONE sheet of A4 paper you are to create a collage (visual representation) of the concept
REFLECTIONS OF AUSTRALIA’S CULTURAL IDENTITY
This may include painting, drawing, cut out pictures or graphics.
You are not being marked on your artistic ability but rather the thought and effort put into your representation.
On the reverse side of the paper you are to explain in 300 words, in your own handwriting, why you positioned the images in the particular way to represent the concept. You might consider colour, layout, juxtaposition and reading paths (vectors).
