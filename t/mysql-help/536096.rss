    <description>hi guys im adding highscores to my server, i think i have done most of it but i jsut have 1 problem.

i have a databasepool.java implented into my server and when i run my server it tells me in my cmd that the databasepool has successfully connected to my websites database. now then i added in all the stuff to update highscores to website, and i made a command in order to update highscores, but when i type the command to update highscores it says in my cmd &quot; error connecting, could not save highscores&quot; 

i don&#39;t understand why its not updating if the databasepool is alredy connected fine?</description>
