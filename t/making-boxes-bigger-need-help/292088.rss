    <description>Ok, i need help with making boxes on interfaces bigger, and i interfaces i mean are like the friends list,ignore, the Male and female Tab boxes on the Character design interface, and in the attack interface also.
what im asing for is how can i change it to make the boxes a litte bigger like 2cm bigger or so.
i am certain this is possible as i seen many people do this, but i need to know how to.
