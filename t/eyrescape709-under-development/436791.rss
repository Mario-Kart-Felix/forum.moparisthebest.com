<p>All you did was download the stolen copy of my source from Rune-Server and then put it online immediately.</p>
<p>Just to let you know, this is only 700, not 709 you fuckin moron.<br>
The idiot who thought they stole my 704 got the 700.</p>
<p>So inb4 every single post you get is flame, I would shut this topic down. Because it’s obvious your incapable of doing anything.</p>
<p>And btw, Every single thing your claiming credit for, e.g. trading, mem leak fixes, GPI fixes, are all STOLEN from me. So gtfo moron.[/quote]</p>
