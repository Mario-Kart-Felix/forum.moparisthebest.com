              <p>Dell451, some people portray him as the Grim Reaper, other give him the name Death, which is much more Elusive. I don’t necessarily believe there is a being such as this, but, there can be mass murderers who pass off as this Sinister creature.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <blockquote>The portrayal of the scythe originates from a Hellenistic etymological misconception relating the god Cronus with time. Cronus was a harvest deity who is often shown with a sickle, which he also uses to castrate his father, Uranus. Etymologists from the Hellenistic period erroneously correlated Cronus with time due to the similarity with the prefix chrono-. From this mistake, Cronus was often depicted as Father Time, carrying a scythe, which is a harvesting tool related to the sickle. The characters of Father Time and the Grim Reaper frequently overlap, leading to the common portrayal of the Grim Reaper brandishing a scythe.</blockquote>
<p>Is has become a stereotype because of a mistake. I don’t doubt that you have seen it, only because you made this topic in the first place. An un-dead skeleton with a sickle however, does not exist.</p>
