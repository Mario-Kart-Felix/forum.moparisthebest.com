<p>people overlook the amount of work he put in, they see RSCA and think of me and peeter as the people doing the work, his work does not really stand out, but i can tell you if it was just me and peeter running RSCA without KO9 then nobody would even remember the name RSCA. But i do agree for KO9 shutting down the server was a good thing, he used to be all happy and stuff, towards the last 6 months of RSCA he turned into a faggot tbh (&lt;3) lots of people noticed, he also got fairly lazy as anyone would (like me now, with RSCE). But now that hes free hes a better person, like weight lifted off his back, same thing i felt after i left RSCA.</p>
<p>it seriously is a huge commitment dealing with that shit, KO9 used to ring me at 2am waking me up to fix important bugs n shit, im sure he woke up many times premature for server management reasons. His position in the team was very important, he was like a hybrid. the lead administrator, bought the server, configured it, maintained it, set up me and pets tools to make our life easier, knew his way around the web shit and server code, knew how it all worked and even fixed a couple of bugs in game now and then. dealt with all ddos shit, he seriously took the role of a few guys and did what he could and we got through just fine.</p>
<p>i always had a lot of respect for KO9 and others should too, even under the hardest of DDoS situations i kept telling him lets attack back and get aggressive, instead he stood his grounds and dealt with it, not once did he try anything malicious against anyone else the whole time we were running RSCA which is why i guess RSCA was known as a good, positive server.[/quote]<br>
Soppy, but it means a lot to me knowing you understand that^. I was quite miserable towards the end of RSCA really. I was a cunt to lots of people, including the ones just trying to help me so heh, apologies all round :/.</p>
<p>With regards to Project P2P Luke, those who may remember when I first started posting on mopar, I was a lot more positive and helpful towards others. I helped Matt (Project P2P) for the first 8 months of his server. I had root access to his server and I helped admin it with him as I did with Pets, when he asked me for help now and then. He never posted about it on his forums when I helped him, gave me minimal credit and was a cunt to me in the end. I thought you (Luke) were doing the same thing, which is why I was a cunt to you also. So apologies to you a bit too.</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel liberated. Let’s move on (:.</p>
<p>Edit: FTR: When I say Matt, I mean Matt punKrockeR, not ProjectP2P…</p>

<p>In my opinion (off topic here I know) only KO9 has run a successful server, xEnt and Peeter joined after it was successful. Sure they coded more than you and without the their help it wouldn’t be anywhere near as good as it was, but I personally see dealing with all the server management, DDoS, community problems and so on is harder than sitting staring at Eclipse. I certainly know what I’d sooner be doing… Take Zilent for example, he’s committed far more code than anyone to RSCEmulation but that’s literally all he’s done. I’m not sure if that’s classed as ‘running’ a successful server but I guess that’s a matter of opinion. Not really relevant just a thought I had when reading your post.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I do agree with you, without sounding big headed****. But conversations with some people and really… naming no names. I just feel proud of what I did in those two years and really can’t give two shits what anyone else thinks anymore. I am happy people are using the RSCA source though, or at least looking and playing with it.</p>
<p>**** I mean with regards to RSCA btw not the comments RE: servers. Luke you haven’t been here long enough to say that. xEnt and Pets have contributed more towards this community than I have. I did do a lot for RSCA though:-</p>
<p>Website: PHP, XHTML, Forums + Addons/coding, Main site some code tweaking etc.<br>
Community: Always expected to reply to every suggestion thread or apparently there is no reason for one. Expected to be in-game personally all the time. Expected to be on IRC whenever I am highlighted, within minutes (many people saw 1 minute join/quitters).Etc etc. Don’t get me wrong, I got on with a lot of people.<br>
Server: I did code a lot more than people think. I was the logic and reason behind a lot of the development with the ideas for sleeping, quests (first at the time, I used punk’s original system before I knew him.), halloween events that were unique, candy cane staff was dropped first by me and the image was made by nec as per my request when the other guy disappeared… So many ideas I never bothered to say well hey, I did that because at the time I was too busy doing ^^^ to do etc… Fighting botters hardcore for a while - 8 months?<br>
Staff: Set up development stuff for pets, xent, matt… Help brainstorm ideas to problem solve coding problems and other logic etc (I love this shit, I think I helped a lot w/o blowing my trumpet and I hope xEnt vouches for me because he knows I know my coding logic and puzzle solving skillz…). Looking after mods, constantly trying to look for honest and trustworthy mods because of people constantly abusing.<br>
ABUSE DDOS: I spent the first 7 months writing a new linux bash script to null route based on todays attack… I got calls from Meh/Moose/Ryan telling me to get on and sort shit at 4am etc. I got a call from Ryan shortly after i moved saying my ‘dox’ had been leaked because Hixk/Tewl went to the <a href="http://rscangel.org" rel="nofollow noopener">rscangel.org</a> ssl and I stupidly left indexing on… log files for the gc address details etc… Worst thing is I had to apologise to the people who I took money off for subs because I had their trust and I let their ‘dox’ get released too.<br>
MOAR DDOS: Well I lost 2/3 nice servers due to ddos’s, all the while the price of dedis increases etc… The server was strictly non-profit for the first 9 months until we did just straight donations for /nothing/ in return for 3-4 months until xEnt joined… The old skool RSCA’ers will verify this^. The server nearly died 7 months ago before Pets joined as an admin. The DDoS attacks were getting to 6Gbps (honestly…) and fucking UK2/SoftLayer (SOFTLAYER HAVE 50GiGe BW/s :@) dropped us so the bill raised to $500/mo+ because of staminus…</p>
<p>Anyway… I never really told anyone the entire story. I hope people understand why people like I, Luke, Peeter, Hayden, Sean, Jamie, Alex, Matt, etc… Alll the talent this forum lost when you get shit like ^that for 2 years. I do feel bad for the people who enjoyed it but I am ultimately glad I am free… Finally, so I tip my hat off to you Luke, Kryptix o/.</p>

<p>I’m sure that would benefit you having your server more visible and more at the top, however most of the inactive servers are already locked (mine was, st o rk etc, rscd, they were all locked…).</p>
