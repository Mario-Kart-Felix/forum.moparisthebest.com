When i fakely woke up  :rolleyes:, i went into the other room where my parents were. I was like  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=9" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> , so my mom is like “hey bryan, didn’t you get your progress report today?” I was thinking to my self “What the fuck!!!” lol , so i said “yes i did” . i was pulling it out my pocket when my father says “what are you hiding it?” im like “no… <em>laughing</em>  :P” lol. my mom is like “4+!” (a d+, my worste grade ever on a mid term or grades. except quizes  ;D. well anyways , i told my mom a lame excuse and they never really talked about it again. “Thank God!”  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
