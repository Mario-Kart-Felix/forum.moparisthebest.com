    <description>I am using a Delta server. (Dont judge me, Ive always liked delta)

Anyways my dad reset our computer and now my client doesnt work right it bugs up and glitches alot.. I was wondering where is a very basic client that works with delta that i can download? I would like something very very basic, as i am using dialup at this house. I usually download stuff at a different location, but i cannot get to that computer to download my things. 

[b]I DONT WANT TO HEAR ANYONE DISSING ME BECAUSE I GOT DIALUP AT HOME, THAT WOULD SHOW WHAT A NO LIFE YOU REALLY ARE.[/b]

JUST ANSWER MY QUESTION, IF YOU CANNOT ANSWER MY QUESTION PLEASE MOVE ON
