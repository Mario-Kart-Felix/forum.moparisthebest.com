    <title>Cool, I mean Hello</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cool-i-mean-hello/9817</link>
    <description>Wow so really I deleted every thing that had to do with rs cheating when I gave up on rs. Recently I got back to playing, I went looking for kaitnieks to see that it was gone, of course I did not bother to look any further. 

Well after a complete 24 hours of no sleep playing a silly game I got to remembering what wonderful times my pc had playing rs with out me  there  :D  

Thanks to scar I can mine rune loved that program loved those scrips. Sadly enough I&#39;m a leach, I could never get my brain around Perl, think I just lacked the devotion to write a script of my own. 

Happy to see that scar is still around and kicking.  :cool:
I might have to give it a second try.

Really like to get my mage up to 94 with that new enchant onyx spell.  ;)</description>
