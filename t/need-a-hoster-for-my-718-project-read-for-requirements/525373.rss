    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-hoster-for-my-718-project-read-for-requirements/525373</link>
    <description>Hey guys (:   i am trying to start a little something to have fun with ... i need a hoster because i have failed to find a way to get into my router because i dont know any of the credentials and yes i have tried admin in both (sucks cause i have good internet) but yea guys enough of that i need a hoster!  

 requirements.
-MUST have skype and voice chat.
-Must be 14 years of age or older.
-IF you are able to code i will choose you over anyone else that wants to host...
-Thats it guys i think thats easy enough if you lack either of the two requirements above dont even add me on skype.


If you meet the requirements and would like to host hit me up ASAP on skype: ryan.julien1</description>
