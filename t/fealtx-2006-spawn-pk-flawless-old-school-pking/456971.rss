    <title>Fealtx [2006] Spawn PK || Flawless Old-School Pking</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fealtx-2006-spawn-pk-flawless-old-school-pking/456971</link>
    <description>*This was originally posted on Rune-Server under the title of FallenPkz, but that has since been changed, as I have stopped working with Fallen Ashe as he is very immature, which led to his ban on rune-server for forever.

[center][COLOR=blue]Fealtx, the revolution of spawn servers (Not really lol)This will be a 317(2006) Spawn server, with Pkpoints and no customs (Meaning only items from 2006). Featuring flawless pking, this is the server to go to if you want to quench your thirst for oldschool pking, while not having to grind on a poorly coded remake with douchebag staff.[/COLOR]  ;)[/center]

[COLOR=green]
Features:

*Full clipping
*Flawless 2006 pking
*Perfect Potions
*Perfect shops
*Only 317 items, include zerker rings, Fire Cape and Abby whip etc.
*Perfect Dharoks
*Friendly staff (Forum staff and mods will be needed)
*Super Donators get custom yell command
*Only Staff and Donators can yell
*Pkpoints challenging and rewarding
*Pure, Master and setlevel commands

And More!

These are pictures taken by ex-coowner Fallen Ashe. This was before we he was kicked and we changed the name.

Me: %20 for redoing things to it, adding some combat formulas and leeching his base :)

This is a pretty big leech, but Im learning stuff, and hopefully will be able to convert it to hyperion, and writing hyperion combat, therefore releasing this. Once I get a Vps and finish removing npc&#39;s I will host it.

Thank you for reading :)</description>
