<p>[quote=“casey., post:19, topic:328219”]<span class="mention">@Religious</span> views.<br>
I’m honestly not really sure how religious I am in some senses. I’ve been raised as a Catholic my whole life, attending Catholic school for my whole entire schooling life. The one question that I’ve always posed is if there is a God, than why is the world like it is? There’s enough violence in the world, and I would think the “True God” would step in and stop it. I take an extremely agnostic view to my religious ideas. I believe something of a higher power created us, but I question what or who it is. Those who say there is no God or person of creation I find idiotic, because how did we get here? Some will argue evolution, but who put the animals here? Obviously there’s so many unanswered questions that the world has, but what can we do? I suppose and wait till we die and see if there is some form of an after life.</p>

What? The big bang was an explosion bro. When things explode they expand…</p>
<p>Also, are you saying that the constant gravitational pull on every physical matter is God constantly pushing it that way? Because it’s the same physical force as the universe…<br>
[/quote]Yea, but that does not at all me the <span class="bbcode-b">only</span> thing that causes expansion is explosions…</p>
<p>No, I never said anything like that? I was just saying the fact that the universe expands does not mean that an explosion took place.<br>
[/quote]You said God created that motion. So is he creating the same exact motion we have on earth? Or did he just push everything in the fucking universe in opposite directions for fun?<br>
[/quote]God created space and time, which you probably know most scientists say makes gravity. Chances are scientists don’t know everything about the world right now, and if you think they do, you are more naive than most. Where scientific theories have changed over the years and been disproved, the Bible has never changed. I can’t explain why God would make the universe expand, when you die and go to judgment ask him yourself.<br>
[/quote]You can’t explain anything because it’s so broad. Which is also why the Bible doesn’t have to change. Science is specific and all about facts. The Bible can remain broad and catch the masses that it wants while science has the ability to capture the beauty with reason. I know “scientists” don’t know everything about the world. I never said I don’t believe in God, btw.<br>
[/quote]What the hell are you talking about… please give examples about broadness in the Bible…<br>
That’s also one of the main flaw about Science, they try to explain everything and then they end up wrong.<br>
[/quote]But they always revise. There are so many proven facts provided by science. You cannot give one fact from the Bible (that I can think of). And that is because they give broad stories on things you cannot explain rightfully (I’m talking about your “miracles” in the Bible, not the actual stories). They’re open ended, allowing you to say “it’s because God wanted it like that”. Every religion is like that. It’s because anything that you can’t explain you determine that the decision was made by God, where in science they look for what actually caused it.<br>
[/quote]You heard or morals? Life lessons? All of them have roots in religion. And that is what the Bible is. It is not a science textbook to be read to understand how things work, or how things will be. Scientists use what they can to explain what they can, but they have some things wrong. Who’s to say that the universe is even expanding? Perhaps our carbon dating system does not work properly? Scientists continue to revise and revise their information. When people try to prove God doesn’t exist, they use scientific ‘facts’ to do it. Who’s to say that in 20 years that ‘fact’ will even be relevant, or unchanged?[/quote]Carbon dating has nothing to do with universal expansion. Most facts that have survived for 20 years stay true, ex. the discovery of earths round surface, gravity, electricity, etc. It’s progression built on progression, fueled by facts. Yes, the Bible is filled with morals and stories but how can you prove any of it is real. Imo it’s there for lessons, not factual knowledge.</p>

[/quote]But they always revise. There are so many proven facts provided by science. You cannot give one fact from the Bible (that I can think of). And that is because they give broad stories on things you cannot explain rightfully (I’m talking about your “miracles” in the Bible, not the actual stories). They’re open ended, allowing you to say “it’s because God wanted it like that”. Every religion is like that. It’s because anything that you can’t explain you determine that the decision was made by God, where in science they look for what actually caused it.<br>
[/quote]You heard or morals? Life lessons? All of them have roots in religion. And that is what the Bible is. It is not a science textbook to be read to understand how things work, or how things will be. Scientists use what they can to explain what they can, but they have some things wrong. Who’s to say that the universe is even expanding? Perhaps our carbon dating system does not work properly? Scientists continue to revise and revise their information. When people try to prove God doesn’t exist, they use scientific ‘facts’ to do it. Who’s to say that in 20 years that ‘fact’ will even be relevant, or unchanged?<br>
[/quote]Carbon dating has nothing to do with universal expansion. Most facts that have survived for 20 years stay true, ex. the discovery of earths round surface, gravity, electricity, etc. It’s progression built on progression, fueled by facts. Yes, the Bible is filled with morals and stories but how can you prove any of it is real. Imo it’s there for lessons, not factual knowledge.<br>

What? The big bang was an explosion bro. When things explode they expand…</p>
<p>Also, are you saying that the constant gravitational pull on every physical matter is God constantly pushing it that way? Because it’s the same physical force as the universe…<br>
[/quote]Yea, but that does not at all me the <span class="bbcode-b">only</span> thing that causes expansion is explosions…</p>
<p>No, I never said anything like that? I was just saying the fact that the universe expands does not mean that an explosion took place.<br>
[/quote]You said God created that motion. So is he creating the same exact motion we have on earth? Or did he just push everything in the fucking universe in opposite directions for fun?<br>
[/quote]God created space and time, which you probably know most scientists say makes gravity. Chances are scientists don’t know everything about the world right now, and if you think they do, you are more naive than most. Where scientific theories have changed over the years and been disproved, the Bible has never changed. I can’t explain why God would make the universe expand, when you die and go to judgment ask him yourself.<br>
[/quote]You can’t explain anything because it’s so broad. Which is also why the Bible doesn’t have to change. Science is specific and all about facts. The Bible can remain broad and catch the masses that it wants while science has the ability to capture the beauty with reason. I know “scientists” don’t know everything about the world. I never said I don’t believe in God, btw.<br>

Never changed, only added too. (Unless you’re counting the different translations/versions… which would make you retarded) Get this: The old testament was before Christ, and the new testament was after. Go figure!<br>
(Also, if you guys are wondering, my parents aren’t Christian)</p>

        <p>Well I know some people will think I’m a bit off the wall with this post but heres my religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Right now I consider myself an agnostic deist. Since most of you are twats, that means I do believe there is a “God”, though I don’t really know what or who he is, and this “God” doesn’t intervene in human life. I can’t see us evolving from animals nor our planet being formed from the big bang theory. Most people overlook the true beauty of our planet. For example, I don’t think anyone can disagree that if you climb a mountain and take a look around you what awesome things you will see. Though humans are incapable of understanding what has been given to us. Instead we continuously destroy our planet.  I believe this “God” gave us everything for us to appreciate. Even human life is something we take for granted. Wars, murders, everything evil we do defies our creators wishes. Though like I said, I believe that God doesn’t intervene with humans. Whether he’s given up on us or is just waiting to see what happens in the future, so until he makes up his decision, society will continue on it’s downfall.</p>
<p>Now I believe I was given some sort of roles as a messenger to Earth. My goal is to bring peace to Earth. I’m tired of seeing our planet and everything that was given to us destroyed. I want the world to feel the pain that they have shown to our planet and creator. Kill enough people and they will know what pain is. Families losing loved ones and being separated will eventually grow to know what the true meaning of peace is. They will appreciate what has been given to them and not disrespect the planet nor human life because they fear suffering from pain again. Though killing humans is not an act of peace, which means I can’t bring myself to serve these actions. My plan is create a society of peace. Just as the bullshit catholicism was hammered into me, I will hammer it into future generations. These generations know the ideals of our creator, that of peace and appreciation. As time goes on, they will spread the ideals of God. And if society can’t learn from it’s past actions, I guarantee you a new messenger will be born who will be able to bring pain to the world, something I could never bring myself to do and teach the world it’s pain. Though this pain will be artificial until the generations die off and the world will be taught what true peace is.</p>
