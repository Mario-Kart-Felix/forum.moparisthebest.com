    <description>Moparscape has had some difficulties in the past pertaining to religious opinions mixed with inconsiderate comments towards others&#39; beliefs. The fact that any one person on this earth is granted free will, we&#39;re also granted the right to our own opinion. You may believe that it is your duty to right these &quot;wrong&quot; opinions, in which case I&#39;d like to inform you that anyone can say the same thing as you.

To start the thread, I would like to inform you all that this is not going to be a place of flame, elitism, retaliation, discrimination, or spam. Anything going off-topic or that could potentially initiate a flame war will be reported. I&#39;m not going to tolerate ignorance in one of the only threads I post in the General Section.

The subject I&#39;m bringing to the table is your religious and/or lifestyle beliefs. Of course, it&#39;s a broad topic, one of which is incredibly difficult to grasp. The idea that we&#39;re all here for a certain reason depending on what you believe is true can be extraordinarily different from another member&#39;s here at mopar. Are we here to live life to the fullest? Are we here to serve a higher being that has granted us the opportunity to live? Or are we here only because it&#39;s our manifest, our fate-- destined from the start since our origin of the unknown prior to the &quot;Big Bang&quot;. 

I suppose one can&#39;t begin to debate without an argument, a subject to agree or disagree with... So I&#39;ll tell how I see life. We&#39;re all here for the experience. To learn and create memories that include one another. Karma plays a big role in psychological thinking, though I don&#39;t always see it true. Whether you pursue yourself negatively and positively affects who you are as a person. When you&#39;re negative, it&#39;s inevitable that you&#39;re going to receive some sort of negativity in the future. I do believe in a God, but I don&#39;t appreciate the fact that people manipulate others into following [u]one[/u] path. Eternal life after death is something suggested happening after death if you follow the right path. I think that as long as you&#39;re optimistic and treat others with respect while respecting the laws and yourself universally, you&#39;re granted this &quot;nirvana&quot;.

Everyone has different views, whether they put their trust in family whom has told them, a Biology book that has influence their beliefs, or from just plain knowledge and experience. Vitality is but an enigma of which we can&#39;t fathom with true reference other than what we believe is true. You never know, one of us may be right ;).

              <p>[quote=“casey., post:77, topic:328219”]Well I know some people will think I’m a bit off the wall with this post but heres my religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Right now I consider myself an agnostic deist. Since most of you are twats, that means I do believe there is a “God”, though I don’t really know what or who he is, and this “God” doesn’t intervene in human life. I can’t see us evolving from animals nor our planet being formed from the big bang theory. Most people overlook the true beauty of our planet. For example, I don’t think anyone can disagree that if you climb a mountain and take a look around you what awesome things you will see. Though humans are incapable of understanding what has been given to us. Instead we continuously destroy our planet.  I believe this “God” gave us everything for us to appreciate. Even human life is something we take for granted. Wars, murders, everything evil we do defies our creators wishes. Though like I said, I believe that God doesn’t intervene with humans. Whether he’s given up on us or is just waiting to see what happens in the future, so until he makes up his decision, society will continue on it’s downfall.</p>
<p>Now I believe I was given some sort of roles as a messenger to Earth. My goal is to bring peace to Earth. I’m tired of seeing our planet and everything that was given to us destroyed. I want the world to feel the pain that they have shown to our planet and creator. Kill enough people and they will know what pain is. Families losing loved ones and being separated will eventually grow to know what the true meaning of peace is. They will appreciate what has been given to them and not disrespect the planet nor human life because they fear suffering from pain again. Though killing humans is not an act of peace, which means I can’t bring myself to serve these actions. My plan is create a society of peace. Just as the bullshit catholicism was hammered into me, I will hammer it into future generations. These generations know the ideals of our creator, that of peace and appreciation. As time goes on, they will spread the ideals of God. And if society can’t learn from it’s past actions, I guarantee you a new messenger will be born who will be able to bring pain to the world, something I could never bring myself to do and teach the world it’s pain. Though this pain will be artificial until the generations die off and the world will be taught what true peace is.[/quote]But why can’t you see that war <span class="bbcode-i">is </span>that “pain” you’re talking about? It’s become so natural for us to contemplate eachother’s differences and resolve it with violence that any act as far as murder will not give anyone a different perspective on the value of life. What I’m saying is, by initiating so much pain in order to stabilize societies’ morals you will in turn only set a new standard of hate throughout the world. It’s literally impossible to solve anything with violence because it will only be used later for more violence. Gandhi’s methods, however, are incredibly successful. By persistently exerting active peace while receiving violence, it could psychologically effect our view on the matter.</p>
<p>And you mentioned being a messenger. I also believe in the whole “messenger” theology, but it’s more broad. Not specifically one person, but rather a number of successful people throughout the world were destined to do what they did. It wasn’t them that was gifted with their message, but what they did and how they did it.</p>

No, it is a book you seem to blindly believe, this is why faith is impossible to debate. Ps, you are very funny, you do realize the bible has been changed over and over since it was initially written right?<br>
[/quote]Not blindly, I have witnessed first hand a few miracles, which is when I became a Christian.<br>
Never changed, only added too. (Unless you’re counting the different translations/versions… which would make you retarded) Get this: The old testament was before Christ, and the new testament was after. Go figure!<br>
(Also, if you guys are wondering, my parents aren’t Christian)[/quote]It was rewritten. King James. Don’t give me rebuttals such as “for translation”. It was changed to suit the era at the time. Morals and society had changed, so the Bible was renovated with it.</p>

What? The big bang was an explosion bro. When things explode they expand…</p>
<p>Also, are you saying that the constant gravitational pull on every physical matter is God constantly pushing it that way? Because it’s the same physical force as the universe…<br>
[/quote]Yea, but that does not at all me the <span class="bbcode-b">only</span> thing that causes expansion is explosions…</p>
<p>No, I never said anything like that? I was just saying the fact that the universe expands does not mean that an explosion took place.<br>
[/quote]You said God created that motion. So is he creating the same exact motion we have on earth? Or did he just push everything in the fucking universe in opposite directions for fun?<br>
[/quote]God created space and time, which you probably know most scientists say makes gravity. Chances are scientists don’t know everything about the world right now, and if you think they do, you are more naive than most. Where scientific theories have changed over the years and been disproved, the Bible has never changed. I can’t explain why God would make the universe expand, when you die and go to judgment ask him yourself.<br>
[/quote]You can’t explain anything because it’s so broad. Which is also why the Bible doesn’t have to change. Science is specific and all about facts. The Bible can remain broad and catch the masses that it wants while science has the ability to capture the beauty with reason. I know “scientists” don’t know everything about the world. I never said I don’t believe in God, btw.<br>
[/quote]What the hell are you talking about… please give examples about broadness in the Bible…<br>
That’s also one of the main flaw about Science, they try to explain everything and then they end up wrong.<br>
[/quote]But they always revise. There are so many proven facts provided by science. You cannot give one fact from the Bible (that I can think of). And that is because they give broad stories on things you cannot explain rightfully (I’m talking about your “miracles” in the Bible, not the actual stories). They’re open ended, allowing you to say “it’s because God wanted it like that”. Every religion is like that. It’s because anything that you can’t explain you determine that the decision was made by God, where in science they look for what actually caused it.<br>
[/quote]You heard or morals? Life lessons? All of them have roots in religion. And that is what the Bible is. It is not a science textbook to be read to understand how things work, or how things will be. Scientists use what they can to explain what they can, but they have some things wrong. Who’s to say that the universe is even expanding? Perhaps our carbon dating system does not work properly? Scientists continue to revise and revise their information. When people try to prove God doesn’t exist, they use scientific ‘facts’ to do it. Who’s to say that in 20 years that ‘fact’ will even be relevant, or unchanged?<br>
[/quote]Carbon dating has nothing to do with universal expansion. Most facts that have survived for 20 years stay true, ex. the discovery of earths round surface, gravity, electricity, etc. It’s progression built on progression, fueled by facts. Yes, the Bible is filled with morals and stories but how can you prove any of it is real. Imo it’s there for lessons, not factual knowledge.<br>
[/quote]I was off the topic of universal expansion, and back to the main discussion. I was talking about the estimate of the worlds age, and the outrageous time-line scientists have come up with.<br>
It’s there for lessons, and actual knowledge about the religion. Like I said, it is not a textbook about how things work or why they do.</p>
<p>[/quote]No, it is a book you seem to blindly believe, this is why faith is impossible to debate. Ps, you are very funny, you do realize the bible has been changed over and over since it was initially written right?[/quote]Not blindly, I have witnessed first hand a few miracles, which is when I became a Christian.<br>

What? The big bang was an explosion bro. When things explode they expand…</p>
<p>Also, are you saying that the constant gravitational pull on every physical matter is God constantly pushing it that way? Because it’s the same physical force as the universe…<br>
[/quote]Yea, but that does not at all me the <span class="bbcode-b">only</span> thing that causes expansion is explosions…</p>
<p>No, I never said anything like that? I was just saying the fact that the universe expands does not mean that an explosion took place.<br>
[/quote]You said God created that motion. So is he creating the same exact motion we have on earth? Or did he just push everything in the fucking universe in opposite directions for fun?<br>
[/quote]God created space and time, which you probably know most scientists say makes gravity. Chances are scientists don’t know everything about the world right now, and if you think they do, you are more naive than most. Where scientific theories have changed over the years and been disproved, the Bible has never changed. I can’t explain why God would make the universe expand, when you die and go to judgment ask him yourself.<br>
[/quote]You can’t explain anything because it’s so broad. Which is also why the Bible doesn’t have to change. Science is specific and all about facts. The Bible can remain broad and catch the masses that it wants while science has the ability to capture the beauty with reason. I know “scientists” don’t know everything about the world. I never said I don’t believe in God, btw.<br>
[/quote]What the hell are you talking about… please give examples about broadness in the Bible…<br>
That’s also one of the main flaw about Science, they try to explain everything and then they end up wrong.<br>
[/quote]But they always revise. There are so many proven facts provided by science. You cannot give one fact from the Bible (that I can think of). And that is because they give broad stories on things you cannot explain rightfully (I’m talking about your “miracles” in the Bible, not the actual stories). They’re open ended, allowing you to say “it’s because God wanted it like that”. Every religion is like that. It’s because anything that you can’t explain you determine that the decision was made by God, where in science they look for what actually caused it.<br>
[/quote]You heard or morals? Life lessons? All of them have roots in religion. And that is what the Bible is. It is not a science textbook to be read to understand how things work, or how things will be. Scientists use what they can to explain what they can, but they have some things wrong. Who’s to say that the universe is even expanding? Perhaps our carbon dating system does not work properly? Scientists continue to revise and revise their information. When people try to prove God doesn’t exist, they use scientific ‘facts’ to do it. Who’s to say that in 20 years that ‘fact’ will even be relevant, or unchanged?<br>
[/quote]Carbon dating has nothing to do with universal expansion. Most facts that have survived for 20 years stay true, ex. the discovery of earths round surface, gravity, electricity, etc. It’s progression built on progression, fueled by facts. Yes, the Bible is filled with morals and stories but how can you prove any of it is real. Imo it’s there for lessons, not factual knowledge.<br>
[/quote]I was off the topic of universal expansion, and back to the main discussion. I was talking about the estimate of the worlds age, and the outrageous time-line scientists have come up with.<br>

Like I said, it is not a textbook about how things work or why they do.[/quote]No, it is a book you seem to blindly believe, this is why faith is impossible to debate.

I’m honestly not really sure how religious I am in some senses. I’ve been raised as a Catholic my whole life, attending Catholic school for my whole entire schooling life. The one question that I’ve always posed is if there is a God, than why is the world like it is? There’s enough violence in the world, and I would think the “True God” would step in and stop it. I take an extremely agnostic view to my religious ideas. I believe something of a higher power created us, but I question what or who it is. Those who say there is no God or person of creation I find idiotic, because how did we get here? Some will argue evolution, but who put the animals here? Obviously there’s so many unanswered questions that the world has, but what can we do? I suppose and wait till we die and see if there is some form of an after life.</p>
