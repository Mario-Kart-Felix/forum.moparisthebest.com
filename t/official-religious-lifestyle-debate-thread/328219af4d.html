        <p>[quote=“casey., post:77, topic:328219”]Well I know some people will think I’m a bit off the wall with this post but heres my religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Right now I consider myself an agnostic deist. Since most of you are twats, that means I do believe there is a “God”, though I don’t really know what or who he is, and this “God” doesn’t intervene in human life. I can’t see us evolving from animals nor our planet being formed from the big bang theory. Most people overlook the true beauty of our planet. For example, I don’t think anyone can disagree that if you climb a mountain and take a look around you what awesome things you will see. Though humans are incapable of understanding what has been given to us. Instead we continuously destroy our planet.  I believe this “God” gave us everything for us to appreciate. Even human life is something we take for granted. Wars, murders, everything evil we do defies our creators wishes. Though like I said, I believe that God doesn’t intervene with humans. Whether he’s given up on us or is just waiting to see what happens in the future, so until he makes up his decision, society will continue on it’s downfall.</p>
<p>Now I believe I was given some sort of roles as a messenger to Earth. My goal is to bring peace to Earth. I’m tired of seeing our planet and everything that was given to us destroyed. I want the world to feel the pain that they have shown to our planet and creator. Kill enough people and they will know what pain is. Families losing loved ones and being separated will eventually grow to know what the true meaning of peace is. They will appreciate what has been given to them and not disrespect the planet nor human life because they fear suffering from pain again. Though killing humans is not an act of peace, which means I can’t bring myself to serve these actions. My plan is create a society of peace. Just as the bullshit catholicism was hammered into me, I will hammer it into future generations. These generations know the ideals of our creator, that of peace and appreciation. As time goes on, they will spread the ideals of God. And if society can’t learn from it’s past actions, I guarantee you a new messenger will be born who will be able to bring pain to the world, something I could never bring myself to do and teach the world it’s pain. Though this pain will be artificial until the generations die off and the world will be taught what true peace is.[/quote]But why can’t you see that war <span class="bbcode-i">is </span>that “pain” you’re talking about? It’s become so natural for us to contemplate eachother’s differences and resolve it with violence that any act as far as murder will not give anyone a different perspective on the value of life. What I’m saying is, by initiating so much pain in order to stabilize societies’ morals you will in turn only set a new standard of hate throughout the world. It’s literally impossible to solve anything with violence because it will only be used later for more violence. Gandhi’s methods, however, are incredibly successful. By persistently exerting active peace while receiving violence, it could psychologically effect our view on the matter.</p>
<p>And you mentioned being a messenger. I also believe in the whole “messenger” theology, but it’s more broad. Not specifically one person, but rather a number of successful people throughout the world were destined to do what they did. It wasn’t them that was gifted with their message, but what they did and how they did it.</p>

No, it is a book you seem to blindly believe, this is why faith is impossible to debate. Ps, you are very funny, you do realize the bible has been changed over and over since it was initially written right?<br>
[/quote]Not blindly, I have witnessed first hand a few miracles, which is when I became a Christian.<br>
Never changed, only added too. (Unless you’re counting the different translations/versions… which would make you retarded) Get this: The old testament was before Christ, and the new testament was after. Go figure!<br>
(Also, if you guys are wondering, my parents aren’t Christian)[/quote]It was rewritten. King James. Don’t give me rebuttals such as “for translation”. It was changed to suit the era at the time. Morals and society had changed, so the Bible was renovated with it.</p>
