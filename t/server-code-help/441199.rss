    <description>so my problem is.. When i put my cache into a .zip file and drop it in Dropbox so i can make an autocache downloader on my client. but when i give my friend my .jar file of my client, it downloads for him and everything but when he opens the file my custom weapons are not working nor items that i added to the server is not working... Anyone know why.

* And Yes it works for me because i have my cache and my custom weapons already in cache, my whole point my friends are not getting the updated cache of the one i added items in.</description>

Rename the output in your signlink class. After that, they will have to obtain an updated class file of your signlink class.</li>
