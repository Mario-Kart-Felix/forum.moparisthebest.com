    <title>HELP please, A few, possibly simple problems :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-please-a-few-possibly-simple-problems/438245</link>
    <description>Hello, 
On my server (i&#39;m Using a &#39;Kromescape&#39; Source or whatever source that is based on), When i click the &#39;Corporal Beast&#39; Option on Boss Teleports, It comes up with an error along the lines of:
[b]&#39;Could not find vertex, force closed packet[/b]&#39; It basically freezes, logs me out and then when you re log, you appear at Corp. How can this Force log be solved?

[QUOTE]} else if (c.teleAction == 3) {
					c.getPA().spellTeleport(2366,4968,0);
					c.sendMessage(&quot;Good luck with the mighty Corporeal Beast!&quot;);
					c.sendMessage(&quot;Note: Magic protect, Ruby bolts (e) and Diamond bolts (e) are recommended!&quot;);
					c.getPA().closeAllWindows(); [/Quote]

Also, [b]the game Takes a fairly long time to log in[/b], Can anything be done about this?

Finally, When the Bank is maxed out with money (2147m), and you go to put money in via the &#39;Bank all&#39; tab, It lags a while and a [b]mass of &#39;bank full!&#39; messages appear[/b]. solution?


Help would much be appreciated :D

              <p>problem 1. find it in the source and post the code here.</p>
<p>problem 2. no, it’s loading. if you want a faster client/server use a 317 deob, with a stable source.</p>
<p>problem 3. put a if and return statement in the code with bank all.</p>
