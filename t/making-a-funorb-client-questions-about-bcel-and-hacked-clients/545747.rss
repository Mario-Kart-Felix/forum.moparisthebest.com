    <title>Making a Funorb Client: Questions about BCEL and Hacked clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-funorb-client-questions-about-bcel-and-hacked-clients/545747</link>
    <description>So about a year or two ago I made a very small client built around Ollie&#39;s funorb loader, just so I could have a faster way of loading the games.  Fast-forward to now, I&#39;ve decided to begin building on that client again to help liven up the funorb community a bit.

This is what it looks like ATM:

Now, I thought it would be a good idea if I could hack the game clients at run-time with BCEL to make the client more than just a loader with a chat service.  I have a few questions on whether or not these are possible with byte-code editting:
A) Potentially fix an exploitable client-side bug which allows anyone to de-sync/&quot;disconnect&quot; every player in the same game as them.  (Obv. the fix would only work for the person using the new client.)
B) Be able to grab the player&#39;s username using a getter-method, so that I could verify their usernames in the new client&#39;s chat lobby.  To me this is the most important one.  Are the usernames encrypted or should this be pretty easy to do?

I also have a few questions as to which way would be the best approach. Should I be hacking the loader .jar and/or the client .jar at run-time? Or just bundle it up with the new client?  I can already make the new client load the unsigned client .jar files on my computer that I collected a couple years ago; it might be the most straight-forward way if I could just hack the .jars there, but the problem is that it has to load the game resources every time, which would sort of ruin the point.

I know this is a lot of questions but an answer to any would be appreciated  :).</description>

              <p>pretty late but for anyone checking this out, you can fix the dc bug. the packet for player messages comes in and the size byte has overflowed, so you just need to split it into two packets and correct the isaac or trim the message.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the help :).  I guess I should use something like the libpcap library if I want to keep everything in java?</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve just thought of a way to hack both the loader and client .jars at run-time.  What if I took the loader .jar loadClass method and split it in two, so that instead of it being a void method, instead the first method would return the JavaClasses of the client .jar before the loader loads it, and then the next method would take a JavaClass as a parameter and then does the rest?  That way I can edit the client’s classes just as easily as the loader’s.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I’m not sure if the disconnect bug can be fixed<br>
iirc the server doesn’t handle it properly and everyone’s isaac packets gets out of synch<br>
but I could be wrong and just ignoring that packet while still incrementing the receiving isaac counter might work</p>
<p>anyone can spoof their display name with the namehack so if I were you I’d be sure to steal the username from the log in stage and in your lobby use:<br>
displayname (username): message</p>
<p>the username is sent on the log in packet and I think it’s only the password that is encrypted, and server responds with display name</p>
<p>p.s. you can also fix that crash bug I discovered a few years ago if you limit the number of actions from 255 to something reasonable</p>
