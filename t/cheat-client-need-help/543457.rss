    <title>Cheat client Need help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cheat-client-need-help/543457</link>
    <description>Hello,

I have a cheat client from a server I played on. Recently the owner Re-Released the server, but i still have an old cheat client. Someone told me I can use this old cheat client for the new server, Can someone help me with that? My skype: Gerben.bartels (it will say Mod newplayer(rune-x-scape)/irl gerben bartels (bunny face picture). If you can contact me and help me out, I would really appreciate it. Or can you leave an instruction guide here on the forums.</description>

              <p>Yes you should have no problem connecting via the older client unless it forces you to update it… then you’d have to get the new jar client and see if you can use it without any problems…<br>
And by that I mean, check if to see if their current client is obfuscated or not.</p>
