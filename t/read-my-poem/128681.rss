    <title>Read My Poem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/read-my-poem/128681</link>
    <description>I usually don&#39;t do this, but I really wanted people to give constructive criticism towards it, and almost no one goes in the writing section. Please read, rate, and tell me what you think. I guess we could discuss maybe the source of my emotion when I wrote it this morning. Please tell me what you think. Sorry for the vast vocabulary, but I was feeling really intellectual at the time. You might need dictionary.com for this. I was thinking about entering it in my schools poetry thing for freshman, I think it&#39;d get a few good remarks.


Lack Of Compassion
Buzzy Jack

The fist clenches,
And so do it&#39;s intentions.
It doesn&#39;t know how to breathe, and it&#39;s all regression.
Manifestation of it&#39;s aggression due to lies of creation,
Imaginations of your torture increases it&#39;s elation.

It&#39;s chest is cold when It thinks of you,
And it&#39;s all It can do not to let this hatred brew.
But it&#39;s to late, and now It thinks of how these thoughts were accrued,
And it can&#39;t help but let it&#39;s actions pursue.
And it&#39;s to late for you as it&#39;s emotional disposition is distributed.

As it&#39;s abhorrence is acuted,
And as it reaches it&#39;s destination,
There is no hope for your salvation,
You are now in line for damnation,
And your death becomes accelerated.

And to think,
You created this abominable collaboration,
With your selfish temptations and power hungry dictation.
The thoughts of your deobfuscation is it&#39;s only motivation,
As is your fascination with power molestation.
&quot;Justicia Servo&quot; Is it&#39;s ambition,
And it has set off the ignition of your eternal excruciation.
And just like you and your need for constant prevarication,
My detestation for you will go on in infinite continuation.</description>

              <p>I usually don’t do this, but I really wanted people to give constructive criticism towards it, and almost no one goes in the writing section. Please read, rate, and tell me what you think. I guess we could discuss maybe the source of my emotion when I wrote it this morning. Please tell me what you think. Sorry for the vast vocabulary, but I was feeling really intellectual at the time. You might need <a href="http://dictionary.com" rel="nofollow noopener">dictionary.com</a> for this. I was thinking about entering it in my schools poetry thing for freshman, I think it’d get a few good remarks.</p>
<p>Lack Of Compassion<br>
Buzzy Jack</p>
<p>The fist clenches,<br>
And so do it’s intentions.<br>
It doesn’t know how to breathe, and it’s all regression.<br>
Manifestation of it’s aggression due to lies of creation,<br>
Imaginations of your torture increases it’s elation.</p>
<p>It’s chest is cold when It thinks of you,<br>
And it’s all It can do not to let this hatred brew.<br>
But it’s to late, and now It thinks of how these thoughts were accrued,<br>
And it can’t help but let it’s actions pursue.<br>
And it’s to late for you as it’s emotional disposition is distributed.</p>
<p>As it’s abhorrence is acuted,<br>
And as it reaches it’s destination,<br>
There is no hope for your salvation,<br>
You are now in line for damnation,<br>
And your death becomes accelerated.</p>
<p>And to think,<br>
You created this abominable collaboration,<br>
With your selfish temptations and power hungry dictation.<br>
The thoughts of your deobfuscation is it’s only motivation,<br>
As is your fascination with power molestation.<br>
“Justicia Servo” Is it’s ambition,<br>
And it has set off the ignition of your eternal excruciation.<br>
And just like you and your need for constant prevarication,<br>
My detestation for you will go on in infinite continuation.</p>
