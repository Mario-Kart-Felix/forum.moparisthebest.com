    <description>http://www.w3schools.com/cert/

Is this legit? I mean anybody could cheat and literally have the certificate given to them. Is it worth getting them from w3schools? 

I scored 100% in the JS practice test when I have 0 knowledge of it lmao and like 80% in the SQL one because of deathchaos&#39;s highscore tut lmao

They let you take the test anywhere you want as long as you got somebody making sure you don&#39;t cheat e.g. boss or teacher. 

What would you say?</description>

<p>100% disagree. Certs from CompTIA, Cisco and Microsoft are all very valuable to most companies.</p>
<p>That being said… A person with every certificate in the world could be less knowledgeable than some frank_ off the street who’s been on the pc their entire life. But to a company the certs are a way to easily prove that knowledge.</p>

Yeah, from recognised bodies (i.e., universities, trade schools, and other qualification providers that are formally recognised). W3schools is just a reference website.</p>

              <p>I’m not sure the usefulness of the certificate in a workplace relating to website design and development since I work in a completely different walk of life but it’s always something else to add to your CV. I mean, you’d be spending about £60 on a certificate that may not help you get your foot in the door to a line of work relating to this but if you have the money spare then go ahead. It is recommended by quite a few universities and as a few of my friends attend Dundee and a shit ton of them tried to get in then I’d say it’s a pretty prestigious university. Like I said, if you have the money spare then I don’t see why not but if it was me I’d rather attend some form of night class at a local college or something like that and speak to the lecturer, see what they have to say. Failing that just send a few emails to local firms and see what their stance on it is.</p>
<p>Lothy may be able to help on this since I think he’s the only person here who actually works as a website developer.</p>
