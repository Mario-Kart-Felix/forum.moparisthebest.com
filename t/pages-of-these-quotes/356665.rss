    <description>Can anyone help me find the pages of these quotes?
[The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman] ----- Many thanks in advance

&lt;blockquote&gt;[size=8pt]&quot;...I think it would be the silliest thing you&#39;ve ever done in a lifetime of silly things....&quot;
~~~The Golden Compass 

&quot;That&#39;s the duty of the old,&quot; said the Librarian,&quot; to be anxious on behalf of the young. And the duty of the young is to scorn the anxiety of the old.&quot;
~~~The Golden Compass 

This rivalry was hundreds of years old, and very deep and satisfying.
~~~The Golden Compass 

&quot;...I see the Master as a man having terrible choices to make; whatever he chooses will do harm, but maybe if he does the right thing, a little less harm will come about than if he chooses wrong. God preserve me from having to make that sort of choice.&quot;
~~~The Golden Compass 

Lyra&#39;s knowledge had great gaps in it, like a map of the world largely eaten by mice....
~~~The Golden Compass 

&quot;Take old Belisaria. She&#39;s a seagull, and that means I&#39;m a kind of seagull, too. I&#39;m not grand and splendid, nor beautiful, but I&#39;m a tough old thing and I can survive anywhere and always find a bit of food and company. That&#39;s worth knowing, that is.&quot;
~~~The Golden Compass 

She would be able to stitch a wound or change a bandage, but never to tell a story.
~~~The Golden Compass 

Being a practiced liar doesn&#39;t mean you have a powerful imagination. Many good liars have no imagination at all; it&#39;s that which gives their lies such wide-eyed conviction.
~~~The Golden Compass 

&quot;Witches own nothing, so we&#39;re not interested in preserving value or making profits, and as for the choice between one thing and another, when you live for many hundreds of years, you know that every opportunity will come again.&quot;
~~~The Golden Compass 

The air seemed full of dark intentions, like the forms of thoughts not yet born.
~~~The Golden Compass 

The idea hovered and shimmered delicately, like a soap bubble, and she dared not even look at it directly in case it burst. But she was familiar with the way of ideas, and she let it shimmer, looking away, thinking about something else.
~~~The Golden Compass 

She was afraid of her father, and she admired him profoundly, and she thought he was stark mad; but who was she to judge?
~~~The Golden Compass

The book has many different names; The Northern Lights, The Golden Compass, and His Dark Materials.</p>
<p>I’ve tried searching for all of them but no luck. =[ I really need the pages by tonight.</p>
