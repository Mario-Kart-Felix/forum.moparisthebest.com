    <description>HALF SOLVED - See fourth post for more info!

[b]NO, this is NOT one of those same-old &#39;&quot;help me plx I have an errorzorz  :eek:&quot;&#39; threads.[/b]



Ok, here&#39;s the story:

I&#39;ve been working on this issue for at least three weeks, but just couldn&#39;t figure it out.

I got an error in the compile and runserver bats for all sources I tried.  After two weeks of downloads, installs, uninstalls, path setting, etc, I FINALLY managed to get it right!

NOTE: I&#39;m using Cheezscape here as an example.

When I run the Compile.bat, it shows many sections of text usually 3-5 lines long with pretty much the same stuff, like it&#39;s testing the things or something, and then it says &quot;18 errors&quot; at the bottom.

When I run the Runserver.bat, it QUICKLY flashes &quot;exception in main...&quot; and I can&#39;t even see the rest as it&#39;s so quick that the rest of the text is gone by the time it&#39;s displayed.

When I attempt to run the runMopar.bat, it says &quot;exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang...&quot;, and that&#39;s it. MoparScape won&#39;t work.

I can&#39;t get the online MoparScape Client to load either, it just says in the STATUS BAR &quot;load: class AppletBot not found&quot;.

Please, HELP! I&#39;ve downloaded and updated/installed/uninstalled/modified/moved/deleted over 80 different files/programs/etc trying to get this to work.

Sometimes one thing works, but makes the others worse.  When I try to fix another it is slightly better but the first good one and the others are bad again.

Please, I desperately need help on this...  :( :confused: :mad:</description>

<p>For both of them, it says “The system cannot find the path specified.”</p>
<p>So basically, I must download JRE/JDK 1.5.0_07 and install it in those paths, and it should work, right?</p>
<p>Also, links to the download pages for 1.5.07 would be greatly appreciated.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
