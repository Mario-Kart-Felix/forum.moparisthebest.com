    <description>[center][size=24pt]-- How to write a RSBot Script (Medium) --[/size]
By Davidi2[/center]

[b]BEFORE FOLLOWING THIS TUTORIAL - PLEASE FOLLOW THIS ONE: [/b][url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,454404.0.html]Starting RSBot Scripting[/url]

This tutorial will be straight forward, (somewhat) easy, and help you on your way to making your own scripts. If you did not read the tutorial above, [b]DO SO NOW[/b].

Please have some basic Java knowledge before attempting this tutorial.

Here are some of the things that this tutorial will cover:

[ul][li]Preparing our basic script to be put to use[/li]
[li]Clicking on objects[/li]
[li]Adding more to your paint[/li]
[li]Getting user input before they start your script[/li][/ul]


So lets get started! Open your test script java file now.

[size=15pt][b][u]1. Preparing our script[/u][/b][/size]

The first thing we need to do to make sure our script will work, is make it compatible with RSBots&#39; login script. To do so is just one easy conditional inside our [i]loop()[/i] method. Find your loop method, and place this code inside it:
[code=java]		if (!isLoggedIn()){
			wait(random(3000, 5000));
		}[/code]What this does is make sure we don&#39;t keep the loop going while the login script is logging the character into RuneScape. [b]REMEMBER: This conditional should ALWAYS be at the [u]top[/u] of your loop method[/b]

After we do this, we need to change some of our ScriptManifests so that we know what this script will do. Scroll up to the top of your script, and see if you can figure out what to do. First change the Author, the Category, the Name, and the Version to what you want. We will be doing more with the description later.

[size=15pt][b][u]2. Clicking on objects[/u][/b][/size]

One of the coolest built in features of the RSBot client is that it can click on things for you, one of which is objects. And it&#39;s easy, too! The method for clicking on an object is:
[code=java]atObject(RSObject object, String option); //RSObject is a object entity interface, more on that later[/code]

Before we can use it though, we need to define the RSObject. We do that like so:
[code=java]RSObject object = getNearestObjectByID(objectId);[/code]

However, if the client cant find the object, the RSObject will be a null, and we will have some Null Exceptions in there. So here&#39;s the whole process:
[code=java]final RSObject bankChest = getNearestObjectByID(42192); //42192 is the object ID for the bank chest at Soul Wars
if(bankChest != null) {
     atObject(bankChest, &quot;Use&quot;); //This will click the &#39;Use&#39; option of the bank chest
}[/code]

That&#39;s it! You just change 42192 to the Object Id of your choice and &quot;Use&quot; to whatever the option is. You can put this anywhere, but let&#39;s test it in the loop method. (Remember that everything you put in the loop method goes below the &#39;isLoggedIn&#39; conditional!) If we just copy and paste that code in there, you will get some pretty fun lag. Let&#39;s add a few conditionals so that it will only click it when we want it to.
[code=java]if(inventoryContainsOneOf(995)) { //New method! inventoryContainsOneOf(itemId) is used a lot in scripts. Now the code will only happen if you have at least 1gp in your inventory.
     final RSObject bankChest = getNearestObjectByID(42192); //42192 is the object ID for the bank chest at Soul Wars
     if(bankChest != null) {
           atObject(bankChest, &quot;Use&quot;); //This will click the &#39;Use&#39; option of the bank chest
           wait(5000); //New method! Pauses the script for a certain amount of milliseconds. In this case, it stops it from spam clicking the chest
     }
}[/code]Put that code in, head over to the soul wars bank booth, run the script with nothing in your inventory and see what happens. Restart the script with at least one coin, and wallah!

[size=15pt][b][u]3. Adding more to your paint[/u][/b][/size]

Adding more information to your paint is extremely easy. Let me post the code we made last time:
[code=java]          g.setColor(new Color(0, 0, 0, 50) );
          g.fillRoundRect(3, 180, 155, 130, 5, 5);
          g.setColor( Color.WHITE );
          g.drawString(&quot;Run time: &quot; + sH + &quot;:&quot; + sM + &quot;:&quot; + sS, 12, 200);[/code]
Let me explain which parts you change. The first method sets the color of the background of your GUI. In this case, it&#39;s black (0, 0, 0) with a low opacity (50). This makes it a mostly see-through background. If you wanted it to be more red, try (255, 0, 0, 50)
The next part (fill round rect) draws and fills a rectangle, using the color you set earlier, with the coordinates you give as arguments, and size.
Then we set the text color, in this case, it&#39;s white.
Now we write text onto the GUI, like this: g.drawString(String text, int x, int y);

Too add another line, we could add this below the first &#39;drawString&#39;:
[code=java]g.drawString(&quot;Script by Davidi2&quot;, 12, 216); //Note that I added 16 to the y value, because that makes it 16 pixels lower[/code]

[size=15pt][b][u]4. Getting user input before they start your script[/u][/b][/size]

Getting input from the user can be important. You might ask for an item id, or if you&#39;re making an auto-talker, the text to say. If you remember from the first tutorial, I said that you can put HTML into your script description. And that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do. We&#39;re going to use HTML to create a text box. So back up in your Manifests, let&#39;s make an example autotalker.
[code=java]@ScriptManifest(authors =&quot;Davidi2&quot;, category = &quot;Misc&quot;, name = &quot;Auto Talker&quot;, version = 1.0, 
     description = &quot;&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Auto Talker&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;By: &lt;u&gt;Davidi2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What text do you want to say? &lt;input name=&#39;textInput&#39; type=&#39;text&#39; size=&#39;100&#39; maxlength=&#39;100&#39; value=&#39;Text Here&#39; /&gt;&quot;)[/code]
Now as you can see, I changed my description to some HTML. Now I suggest you read up on  HTML input types if you want the full functionality, but remember this: the name (textInput) will be important later. Make sure it relates to what you want to accomplish. 
Ok, now scroll down to your onStart() method. The Map&lt;String, String&gt; is actually the input you put into the description! So we can use that Map to get the user input:
[code=java]String textInput = args.get(&quot;textInput&quot;);
log(textInput);[/code] Add that below startTime = ...... , save, compile, and run your script. See what happens!

By Davidi2[/center]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">BEFORE FOLLOWING THIS TUTORIAL - PLEASE FOLLOW THIS ONE: </span><a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,454404.0.html" data-bbcode="true">Starting RSBot Scripting</a></p>
<p>This tutorial will be straight forward, (somewhat) easy, and help you on your way to making your own scripts. If you did not read the tutorial above, <span class="bbcode-b">DO SO NOW</span>.</p>
<p>Please have some basic Java knowledge before attempting this tutorial.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things that this tutorial will cover:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Preparing our basic script to be put to use[/li]<br>
[li]Clicking on objects[/li]<br>
[li]Adding more to your paint[/li]<br>
[li]Getting user input before they start your script[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>So lets get started! Open your test script java file now.</p>
<p>[size=15pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">1. Preparing our script</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do to make sure our script will work, is make it compatible with RSBots’ login script. To do so is just one easy conditional inside our <span class="bbcode-i">loop()</span> method. Find your loop method, and place this code inside it:</p>
<p><code>		if (!isLoggedIn()){
			wait(random(3000, 5000));
		}</code>What this does is make sure we don’t keep the loop going while the login script is logging the character into RuneScape. <span class="bbcode-b">REMEMBER: This conditional should ALWAYS be at the <span class="bbcode-u">top</span> of your loop method</span></p>
<p>After we do this, we need to change some of our ScriptManifests so that we know what this script will do. Scroll up to the top of your script, and see if you can figure out what to do. First change the Author, the Category, the Name, and the Version to what you want. We will be doing more with the description later.</p>
<p>[size=15pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">2. Clicking on objects</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>One of the coolest built in features of the RSBot client is that it can click on things for you, one of which is objects. And it’s easy, too! The method for clicking on an object is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">atObject(RSObject object, String option); //RSObject is a object entity interface, more on that later</code></pre>
<p>Before we can use it though, we need to define the RSObject. We do that like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">RSObject object = getNearestObjectByID(objectId);</code></pre>
<p>However, if the client cant find the object, the RSObject will be a null, and we will have some Null Exceptions in there. So here’s the whole process:</p>
<p><code>final RSObject bankChest = getNearestObjectByID(42192); //42192 is the object ID for the bank chest at Soul Wars
if(bankChest != null) {
     atObject(bankChest, "Use"); //This will click the 'Use' option of the bank chest
}</code></p>
<p>That’s it! You just change 42192 to the Object Id of your choice and “Use” to whatever the option is. You can put this anywhere, but let’s test it in the loop method. (Remember that everything you put in the loop method goes below the ‘isLoggedIn’ conditional!) If we just copy and paste that code in there, you will get some pretty fun lag. Let’s add a few conditionals so that it will only click it when we want it to.</p>
<p><code>if(inventoryContainsOneOf(995)) { //New method! inventoryContainsOneOf(itemId) is used a lot in scripts. Now the code will only happen if you have at least 1gp in your inventory.
     final RSObject bankChest = getNearestObjectByID(42192); //42192 is the object ID for the bank chest at Soul Wars
     if(bankChest != null) {
           atObject(bankChest, "Use"); //This will click the 'Use' option of the bank chest
           wait(5000); //New method! Pauses the script for a certain amount of milliseconds. In this case, it stops it from spam clicking the chest
     }
}</code>Put that code in, head over to the soul wars bank booth, run the script with nothing in your inventory and see what happens. Restart the script with at least one coin, and wallah!</p>
<p>[size=15pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">3. Adding more to your paint</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>Adding more information to your paint is extremely easy. Let me post the code we made last time:</p>
<p><code>          g.setColor(new Color(0, 0, 0, 50) );
          g.fillRoundRect(3, 180, 155, 130, 5, 5);
          g.setColor( Color.WHITE );
          g.drawString("Run time: " + sH + ":" + sM + ":" + sS, 12, 200);</code><br>
Let me explain which parts you change. The first method sets the color of the background of your GUI. In this case, it’s black (0, 0, 0) with a low opacity (50). This makes it a mostly see-through background. If you wanted it to be more red, try (255, 0, 0, 50)<br>
The next part (fill round rect) draws and fills a rectangle, using the color you set earlier, with the coordinates you give as arguments, and size.<br>
Then we set the text color, in this case, it’s white.<br>
Now we write text onto the GUI, like this: g.drawString(String text, int x, int y);</p>
<p>Too add another line, we could add this below the first ‘drawString’:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">g.drawString("Script by Davidi2", 12, 216); //Note that I added 16 to the y value, because that makes it 16 pixels lower</code></pre>
<p>[size=15pt]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">4. Getting user input before they start your script</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>Getting input from the user can be important. You might ask for an item id, or if you’re making an auto-talker, the text to say. If you remember from the first tutorial, I said that you can put HTML into your script description. And that’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to use HTML to create a text box. So back up in your Manifests, let’s make an example autotalker.</p>
<p><code>@ScriptManifest(authors ="Davidi2", category = "Misc", name = "Auto Talker", version = 1.0, 
     description = "&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Auto Talker&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;By: &lt;u&gt;Davidi2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What text do you want to say? &lt;input name='textInput' type='text' size='100' maxlength='100' value='Text Here' /&gt;")</code><br>
Now as you can see, I changed my description to some HTML. Now I suggest you read up on  HTML input types if you want the full functionality, but remember this: the name (textInput) will be important later. Make sure it relates to what you want to accomplish.<br>
Ok, now scroll down to your onStart() method. The Map&lt;String, String&gt; is actually the input you put into the description! So we can use that Map to get the user input:</p>
<p><code>String textInput = args.get("textInput");
log(textInput);</code> Add that below startTime = … , save, compile, and run your script. See what happens!</p>
<p>More to come</p>
