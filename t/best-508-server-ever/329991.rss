Who really looks at this topic on my server, the first player become co-owner, players get admin second, third player become mod. Now come look! it is super fun but my server is about one hours open. I have no link but use a client 525 and client who was the first player has become one of my server hoster. i dont know what source i choose! the server ip is 5.3.133.56
