    <title>06/07 based server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/06-07-based-server/553244</link>
    <description>Looking to create not a remake but either an 06 or and 07 based server from a semi blank base. I have the base, the vps and the webhost ready to go! I&#39;m not an advanced programmer when it comes to java, but I know what I&#39;m doing client/server/web sided pretty well. If you&#39;re even just learning don&#39;t hesitate to ask me anything. I&#39;m doing this for learning and for fun purposes only. I may release in the future, but my main goal isn&#39;t the $. Just looking to make some friends and have a good experience creating a server.

add my Skype [u][i][b]un.named40[/b][/i][/u] If you&#39;re interested at all or have any questions! I&#39;m online a lot and I plan to get a lot done.
