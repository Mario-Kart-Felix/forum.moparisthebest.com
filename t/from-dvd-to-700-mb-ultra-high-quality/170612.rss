    <description>[size=24pt]From DVD to 700 MB (Ultra High Quality)[/size]

So you really like a DVD, and you want to save yourself a copy.  You don&#39;t feel like shelling out $0.2598 for a [url=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817132347]DVD-R[/url], but you&#39;re fine with the $0.1599 for a [url=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817131834]CD-R[/url].  So how are we supposed to fit 8 GB worth of material in 700 MB worth of space?  Simple.  First of all, the main movie is only around 4-5 GB, the rest are extras, languages, subtitles.  We need to first copy the movie onto your hard drive.  Then we convert this file to an .avi.  Then we can compress this with x264 to ~600 MB, then compress the audio a tiny bit (going with stereo rather than 5.1 surround).  Mux (multiplex) the video and audio stream, and we arrive at a .mp4 file with ridiculous quality.  Why do it yourself when you can just torrent it?  Because torrents are divx.  You will notice areas with grainy quality, when here, I couldn&#39;t differentiate the dvd from the compressed video.

[size=18pt]This is what you need:[/size]

A source DVD - ~$3 at Blockbuster.
[url=http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/DVD-Shrink-Download-4128.html]DVDShrink[/url] - Freeware at Softpedia.
[url=http://neuron2.net/dgmpgdec/dgmpgdec.html]DGMPGDec[/url] - Freeware at Neuron2.
[url=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=57023]AviSynth 2.5[/url] - Freeware at SourceForge.
[url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/megui]MeGUI[/url] - Freeware at SourceForge.

Dual layer DVD readable drive.

[url=http://www.videolan.org/vlc/]VLC Media Player[/url] or your media player of choice with the x264 codec - Freeware at videolan.org.

I know.  You may be leaving now because of the amount of programs to download.  Please give it a try.  Video encoding is very interesting, and each of these programs can be tinkered and played with individually.

[size=18pt]DVDShrink[/size]

1.  Install DVDShrink.

2.  Pop in the DVD.  If it asks you to install InterActual player, you can ignore it.

3.  Open DVDShrink.

4.  Click &#39;Open Disc&#39; on the tool bar.  Select where the DVD is located (confirm with the title in the brackets) and hit &#39;OK.&#39;  Mine was at D:\[SHREK].  This will select that video to get the source.

5.  Click &#39;Re-author&#39; on the tool bar.  In the DVD Browser on the right-hand side, double-click &#39;Title 1&#39;  under &#39;Main Movie&#39; to add it to the &#39;DVD Compliation&#39; on the left-hand side.  (If you have it, there is no need to copy Angle 2 and/or Angle 3 also.  They seem to be the same video.)  Now you have the video portion down.

6.  Click the &#39;Compression Settings&#39; tab on the upper right-hand side of the window.  Make sure &#39;DVD&#39; or &#39;Title 1&#39; is highlighted on the left-hand side.  Under &#39;Video&#39;, change &#39;Automatic&#39; to &#39;No Compression.&#39;  Under &#39;Audio&#39;, select only one of the audio channels.  I chose &#39;2.  AC3 2-ch English,&#39; English audio in stereo (5.1 surround is double the filesize).  Some videos have 5.1 audio in your language only.  Don&#39;t worry, when we encode the audio, we can downmix it to stereo and save some space.Under &#39;Subpicture&#39;, you can deselect all of them.  These are the subtitles, and I have not tried adding them yet.  On the lower right-hand side, click the play button to preview the video and make sure you have the currect settings chosen.

7.  Click &#39;Edit&#39; in the menu bar, then &#39;Preferences...&#39;.  Click the &#39;Output Files&#39; tab, and deselect &#39;Split VOB files into 1 GB size chunks (recommended).&#39;  We want one big file to work with, not a few small ones.

8.  Click &#39;Backup!&#39; in the tool bar, and click &#39;Yes,&#39; you want to continue.  Select &#39;Hard Disk Folder&#39; as a backup target.  Select a folder to place the ripped video file.  You can uncheck &#39;Create VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS subfolders.&#39;  In the &#39;DVD Region&#39; tab, keep &#39;Region Free&#39; selected.  You should not be able to select anything under &#39;Quality Settings.&#39;  Under the &#39;Options&#39; tab, you can unselect &#39;Run backup in low priority mode.&#39;  The other options are personal choice.  You should not be able to select anything under &#39;Burn Settings.&#39;  Click &#39;OK.&#39;

9.  Click &#39;OK&#39; to begin ripping.  In the window that appears, you can uncheck the &#39;Enable Video Preview&#39; box as it runs.  This process took about an hour if I remember correctly.

[size=18pt]DGMPGDec[/size]

1.  Unzip DGMPGDec, and run DGIndex.exe.

2.  Hit &#39;F2&#39; to choose a file, and select the .vob file created by DVDShrink.  Click &#39;OK.&#39;

3.  In the menu bar, click &#39;Audio,&#39; then &#39;Output Method,&#39; and make sure &#39;Demux All Tracks&#39; is selected.

4.  Hit &#39;F5&#39; to preview the file.  Hit &#39;Esc&#39; when you are satisfied.  In the &#39;Information&#39; box on the right, make sure &#39;FILM&#39; or &#39;NTSC&#39; is by &#39;Video Type.&#39;  I&#39;m not sure what to do otherwise.

5.  Hit &#39;F4&#39; to save the project file.  This is essential, because it demuxes (demultiplexes) the video into a frame index file and an audio file.  The .vob file is still required, because the frame index file only has information about the video, not the video itself.  This took maybe a half an hour if my memory serves me.

[size=18pt]AVISynth[/size]

1.  Install AVISynth.  AVISynth is an extremely powerful program.  It can take a video file and feed it to VDub, VLC Media Player, or even Windows Media Player, while modifying it on-the-fly.  The media player thinks it is accessing a video, when it is only actually an AVISynth script file.  VirtualDub is a flexible recording program that can record from video capture cards or the screen and output an uncompressed .avi file.

2.  In the same folder as the index file (.d2v) from DGMPGDec, right click, select &#39;New,&#39; then &#39;Text Document.&#39;  Name it something descriptive .avs (click Yes to the warning; I called my file shrek.avs).  In the .avs folder, put this (changing the DGDecode.dll link and index file name to their locations on your hard drive; it can be relative or absolute):
[code]LoadPlugin(&quot;C:\Documents and Settings\James\My Documents\Other Docs\DGMPGDec149\DGDecode.dll&quot;)
MPEG2Source(&quot;VTS_01_1.d2v&quot;)
ConvertToYV12()
KillAudio()
#Lanczos4Resize(853,480)  #For widescreen movies[/code]

[size=18pt]MeGUI[/size]

1.  Install MeGUI and run it (&#39;meGUI modern media encoder&#39; in the &#39;megui&#39; program folder).  Run the updater (Ctrl+U) if it does not start up automatically, and make sure you download the latest video profiles.

3.  In MeGUI, in the &#39;Input&#39; tab, under &#39;Video encoding&#39;, locate the AviSynth Script that we just created by clicking on the ellipsis (...).  In the &#39;Video Output&#39; box, designate where you want the video file to be outputted.  In the &#39;Codec&#39; box, select &#39;x264.&#39;  In the &#39;File format&#39; box, select &#39;RAWAVC.&#39;  The extension of the Video Output should change to .264, instead of .mp4.  In the &#39;Video Profile&#39; drop-down box, select &#39;HQ-Insane.&#39;  Trust me, this is truly insane.  Click &#39;Config&#39; right next to the drop-down menu.  This is where it gets a bit math-intensive.

4.  In the &#39;Main&#39; tab, under &#39;General,&#39; there should be a box with a number, which is most likely 1000 (the box is to the right of &#39;Lossless&#39; and below &#39;Automated 2pass&#39;).  This is in kilobits per second.  Find out how long the .avi video is by opening it in VLC Media Player and looking at the number on the bottom left.  For Shrek, I had 1:30:04.  Convert this to seconds, which came to 5404 seconds for me.  Now in the video, we will set aside ideally 620 MB for the video, and 80 MB for the audio.  620 MB / 5404 s = 0.11473 MB/s.  0.11474 MB/s * 1024 KB/s * 8 b/B = 939.867 kilobits per second.  The number you arrive at should be the number you plug into the box which currently has &#39;1000&#39; in it.  If you couldn&#39;t follow my math, just follow this equation.  5079040 / (seconds in video) = (number you put into the box).  Don&#39;t touch anything else, just click &#39;OK&#39;, then &#39;No&#39; to &#39;Update the selected profile?&#39;  Click &#39;Enqueue&#39; for the &#39;Video encoding.&#39;

5.  Next, in the &#39;Input&#39; tab, under &#39;Audio&#39;, click the ellipsis by &#39;Audio Input&#39; and select the .ac3 file that DGMPGDec outputted near the .d2v file.  We&#39;ll jump around a bit here.  Under &#39;Codec&#39;, select &#39;AAC - FAAC&#39;, and under &#39;Extension&#39;, select &#39;Raw-AAC.&#39;  Have the &#39;Audio Output&#39; in the same folder as the &#39;Video Output.&#39;  As for the bitrate, you&#39;ll have to do a bit of math again.  655360 / (number of seconds in movie) = (bitrate for you to put in box).  Also, in the &#39;Config&#39; menu is where you can change &#39;Output Channels&#39; to &#39;Downmix multiple channels to Stereo&#39; if need be.  Click &#39;Enqueue&#39; for the &#39;Audio.&#39;

6.  Now, click the &#39;Queue&#39; tab in the upper left hand corner.  Then click &#39;Start.&#39;  If it asks you to create a worker, just go along with the bs.  This took me 12 hours for two passes on Shrek (90 min movie), so do it overnight.  It took me 16 hours for Shrek (120 min movie).

7.  When you have the two files finished (the .264 and the .aac), click &#39;Tools&#39; in the menu bar, &#39;Muxer,&#39; then &#39;MP4 Muxer.&#39;  Locate the &#39;Video Input,&#39; which is the .264 file, and set FPS to 29.97 if it is NTSC.  Leave &#39;Muxed Input&#39; blank.  Add the &#39;Input&#39; for &#39;Audio 1,&#39; which is the .aac file.  Name the &#39;Muxed Output&#39; file, then click &#39;Queue.&#39;  Go to the &#39;Queue,&#39; and click &#39;Start.&#39;  It should merge the two files into one .mp4 file.  This took 5 minutes for me.  If the final video isn&#39;t the size you wanted, play around with the kilobits per second for the audio, because that takes the shortest time.  When you get it to 700 MB, pat yourself on the back.  I insist.

[size=14pt]This should take you maybe an hour of actual work.  The rest is just the computer doing the hard stuff.  In total, the computer will have clocked upwards of 15 hours of encoding.[/size]

Note:  This took me a damn long time to type up.  It&#39;s just as much for me to organize my thoughts as it is for you guys to share in the knowledge.

EDIT:  Updated with simpler instructions, bypassing the uncompressed .avi step.</description>

<p>Odds are the PSP and MP3 player will not be able to play this file unless you download codecs for it.  The mp4 is merely the container, so it tells very little about the codec inside.</p>

<p>The 150-200 GB free HDD space is for the uncompressed .avi.  I’ll see if I can get AVISynth to pass all the information from a .vob straight to MeGUI, instead of the intermediate uncompressed .avi.

<p>So you really like a DVD, and you want to save yourself a copy.  You don’t feel like shelling out $0.2598 for a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817132347" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">DVD-R</a>, but you’re fine with the $0.1599 for a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817131834" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">CD-R</a>.  So how are we supposed to fit 8 GB worth of material in 700 MB worth of space?  Simple.  First of all, the main movie is only around 4-5 GB, the rest are extras, languages, subtitles.  We need to first copy the movie onto your hard drive.  Then we convert this file to an .avi.  Then we can compress this with x264 to ~600 MB, then compress the audio a tiny bit (going with stereo rather than 5.1 surround).  Mux (multiplex) the video and audio stream, and we arrive at a .mp4 file with ridiculous quality.  Why do it yourself when you can just torrent it?  Because torrents are divx.  You will notice areas with grainy quality, when here, I couldn’t differentiate the dvd from the compressed video.</p>
<p>[size=18pt]This is what you need:[/size]</p>
<p>A source DVD - ~$3 at Blockbuster.<br>

<p>Dual layer DVD readable drive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">VLC Media Player</a> or your media player of choice with the x264 codec - Freeware at <a href="http://videolan.org" rel="nofollow noopener">videolan.org</a>.</p>
<p>I know.  You may be leaving now because of the amount of programs to download.  Please give it a try.  Video encoding is very interesting, and each of these programs can be tinkered and played with individually.</p>
<p>[size=18pt]DVDShrink[/size]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install DVDShrink.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pop in the DVD.  If it asks you to install InterActual player, you can ignore it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open DVDShrink.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click ‘Open Disc’ on the tool bar.  Select where the DVD is located (confirm with the title in the brackets) and hit ‘OK.’  Mine was at D:[SHREK].  This will select that video to get the source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click ‘Re-author’ on the tool bar.  In the DVD Browser on the right-hand side, double-click ‘Title 1’  under ‘Main Movie’ to add it to the ‘DVD Compliation’ on the left-hand side.  (If you have it, there is no need to copy Angle 2 and/or Angle 3 also.  They seem to be the same video.)  Now you have the video portion down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the ‘Compression Settings’ tab on the upper right-hand side of the window.  Make sure ‘DVD’ or ‘Title 1’ is highlighted on the left-hand side.  Under ‘Video’, change ‘Automatic’ to ‘No Compression.’  Under ‘Audio’, select only one of the audio channels.  I chose ‘2.  AC3 2-ch English,’ English audio in stereo (5.1 surround is double the filesize).  Some videos have 5.1 audio in your language only.  Don’t worry, when we encode the audio, we can downmix it to stereo and save some space.Under ‘Subpicture’, you can deselect all of them.  These are the subtitles, and I have not tried adding them yet.  On the lower right-hand side, click the play button to preview the video and make sure you have the currect settings chosen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click ‘Edit’ in the menu bar, then ‘Preferences…’.  Click the ‘Output Files’ tab, and deselect ‘Split VOB files into 1 GB size chunks (recommended).’  We want one big file to work with, not a few small ones.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click ‘Backup!’ in the tool bar, and click ‘Yes,’ you want to continue.  Select ‘Hard Disk Folder’ as a backup target.  Select a folder to place the ripped video file.  You can uncheck ‘Create VIDEO_TS and AUDIO_TS subfolders.’  In the ‘DVD Region’ tab, keep ‘Region Free’ selected.  You should not be able to select anything under ‘Quality Settings.’  Under the ‘Options’ tab, you can unselect ‘Run backup in low priority mode.’  The other options are personal choice.  You should not be able to select anything under ‘Burn Settings.’  Click ‘OK.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click ‘OK’ to begin ripping.  In the window that appears, you can uncheck the ‘Enable Video Preview’ box as it runs.  This process took about an hour if I remember correctly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[size=18pt]DGMPGDec[/size]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unzip DGMPGDec, and run DGIndex.exe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hit ‘F2’ to choose a file, and select the .vob file created by DVDShrink.  Click ‘OK.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the menu bar, click ‘Audio,’ then ‘Output Method,’ and make sure ‘Demux All Tracks’ is selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hit ‘F5’ to preview the file.  Hit ‘Esc’ when you are satisfied.  In the ‘Information’ box on the right, make sure ‘FILM’ or ‘NTSC’ is by ‘Video Type.’  I’m not sure what to do otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hit ‘F4’ to save the project file.  This is essential, because it demuxes (demultiplexes) the video into a frame index file and an audio file.  The .vob file is still required, because the frame index file only has information about the video, not the video itself.  This took maybe a half an hour if my memory serves me.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[size=18pt]AVISynth[/size]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install AVISynth.  AVISynth is an extremely powerful program.  It can take a video file and feed it to VDub, VLC Media Player, or even Windows Media Player, while modifying it on-the-fly.  The media player thinks it is accessing a video, when it is only actually an AVISynth script file.  VirtualDub is a flexible recording program that can record from video capture cards or the screen and output an uncompressed .avi file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the same folder as the index file (.d2v) from DGMPGDec, right click, select ‘New,’ then ‘Text Document.’  Name it something descriptive .avs (click Yes to the warning; I called my file shrek.avs).  In the .avs folder, put this (changing the DGDecode.dll link and index file name to their locations on your hard drive; it can be relative or absolute):</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><code>LoadPlugin("C:\Documents and Settings\James\My Documents\Other Docs\DGMPGDec149\DGDecode.dll")
MPEG2Source("VTS_01_1.d2v")
ConvertToYV12()
KillAudio()
#Lanczos4Resize(853,480)  #For widescreen movies</code></p>
<p>[size=18pt]MeGUI[/size]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install MeGUI and run it (‘meGUI modern media encoder’ in the ‘megui’ program folder).  Run the updater (Ctrl+U) if it does not start up automatically, and make sure you download the latest video profiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In MeGUI, in the ‘Input’ tab, under ‘Video encoding’, locate the AviSynth Script that we just created by clicking on the ellipsis (…).  In the ‘Video Output’ box, designate where you want the video file to be outputted.  In the ‘Codec’ box, select ‘x264.’  In the ‘File format’ box, select ‘RAWAVC.’  The extension of the Video Output should change to .264, instead of .mp4.  In the ‘Video Profile’ drop-down box, select ‘HQ-Insane.’  Trust me, this is truly insane.  Click ‘Config’ right next to the drop-down menu.  This is where it gets a bit math-intensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the ‘Main’ tab, under ‘General,’ there should be a box with a number, which is most likely 1000 (the box is to the right of ‘Lossless’ and below ‘Automated 2pass’).  This is in kilobits per second.  Find out how long the .avi video is by opening it in VLC Media Player and looking at the number on the bottom left.  For Shrek, I had 1:30:04.  Convert this to seconds, which came to 5404 seconds for me.  Now in the video, we will set aside ideally 620 MB for the video, and 80 MB for the audio.  620 MB / 5404 s = 0.11473 MB/s.  0.11474 MB/s * 1024 KB/s * 8 b/B = 939.867 kilobits per second.  The number you arrive at should be the number you plug into the box which currently has ‘1000’ in it.  If you couldn’t follow my math, just follow this equation.  5079040 / (seconds in video) = (number you put into the box).  Don’t touch anything else, just click ‘OK’, then ‘No’ to ‘Update the selected profile?’  Click ‘Enqueue’ for the ‘Video encoding.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, in the ‘Input’ tab, under ‘Audio’, click the ellipsis by ‘Audio Input’ and select the .ac3 file that DGMPGDec outputted near the .d2v file.  We’ll jump around a bit here.  Under ‘Codec’, select ‘AAC - FAAC’, and under ‘Extension’, select ‘Raw-AAC.’  Have the ‘Audio Output’ in the same folder as the ‘Video Output.’  As for the bitrate, you’ll have to do a bit of math again.  655360 / (number of seconds in movie) = (bitrate for you to put in box).  Also, in the ‘Config’ menu is where you can change ‘Output Channels’ to ‘Downmix multiple channels to Stereo’ if need be.  Click ‘Enqueue’ for the ‘Audio.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, click the ‘Queue’ tab in the upper left hand corner.  Then click ‘Start.’  If it asks you to create a worker, just go along with the bs.  This took me 12 hours for two passes on Shrek (90 min movie), so do it overnight.  It took me 16 hours for Shrek (120 min movie).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have the two files finished (the .264 and the .aac), click ‘Tools’ in the menu bar, ‘Muxer,’ then ‘MP4 Muxer.’  Locate the ‘Video Input,’ which is the .264 file, and set FPS to 29.97 if it is NTSC.  Leave ‘Muxed Input’ blank.  Add the ‘Input’ for ‘Audio 1,’ which is the .aac file.  Name the ‘Muxed Output’ file, then click ‘Queue.’  Go to the ‘Queue,’ and click ‘Start.’  It should merge the two files into one .mp4 file.  This took 5 minutes for me.  If the final video isn’t the size you wanted, play around with the kilobits per second for the audio, because that takes the shortest time.  When you get it to 700 MB, pat yourself on the back.  I insist.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[size=14pt]This should take you maybe an hour of actual work.  The rest is just the computer doing the hard stuff.  In total, the computer will have clocked upwards of 15 hours of encoding.[/size]</p>
<p>Note:  This took me a damn long time to type up.  It’s just as much for me to organize my thoughts as it is for you guys to share in the knowledge.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Updated with simpler instructions, bypassing the uncompressed .avi step.</p>
