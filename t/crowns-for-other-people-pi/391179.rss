    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/crowns-for-other-people-pi/391179</link>
    <description>Well I was just wondering would there be anyway to give players with Donator = 2 in their char file a crown, I know people with = 1 have a crown but not = 2.
Would there be anyway and if so how?
Please help me :D

(I know that in ::yell, I added &lt;img=1&gt; [MOD] &lt;/img&gt; but thats in the actual command obv :D )
