    <title>How do you create a character on rsca</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-create-a-character-on-rsca/548436</link>
    <description>I tried to create a character on rsca but their password hash is different from rscd so when I set a password on phpmyadmin using rscd&#39;s hash it&#39;s not the same... Anyone able to set a password on their rsca source as like &quot;password&quot; and send me the hash for it so I can copy paste it into my phpmyadmin to be able to login?</description>
