[list]
[li]Congress response to US relationship with Iraq[/li]
[li]Leaders emerge from a packed field as primaries approach (note: This is asking for who&#39;s going to be the candidate for each party. If you know, post here.)[/li]
[li]Electronic surveillance[/li]
[li][s]Credit, mortgage, stock market issues[/s][/li]
[li][s]Imports from China[/li][/list][/s]
[list][li]Political instability and terrorist issue in Pakistan[/li]
[li]Immigration debate continues[/li]
[li][s]&quot;George decides he wants the Scooter out and about&quot;[/s][/li]
[li]Waiting on line for fancy phones (note: I think this might have something to do with the iPhone)[/li]
[/list]

That&#39;s it, if you know someting, please post. I&#39;ll be crossing these off as I get them. Remember that all of this are events which happened over the summer this year. Thanks.[/ul]</description>
