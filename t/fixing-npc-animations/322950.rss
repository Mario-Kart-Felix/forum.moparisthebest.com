    <title>Fixing NPC Animations?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixing-npc-animations/322950</link>
    <description>Okay, so I&#39;m working on a very important project for a while and I start to notice that most of the NPC&#39;s on my server glitch to hell when you kill them, or when they die. Throughout my whole server coding experience I&#39;ve never changed NPC animations, and for some reason I could never find out how. I&#39;ve tried different things but they never worked right. Can someone lead me to a tutorial or atleast give me an idea on how to fix ALL NPC glitching for when they die? I appreciate it very much</description>
