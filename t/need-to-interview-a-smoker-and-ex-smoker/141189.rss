    <title>Need to interview a smoker and ex-smoker</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-to-interview-a-smoker-and-ex-smoker/141189</link>
    <description> For a school health assignment (nothing too important, just some homework really) I am meant to interview a smoker, and ex smoker and a non smoker. I can just interview my parents for a non smoker but I dont personally know any smokers or ex-smokers (and because i am too lazy to put much effort into finding one).
So if anyone who smokes or smoked can help me out I have 5 questions I need to ask for both, 10 in total.
Smoker questions:
-How old were you when you became a regular smoker?
-Why did you start smoking?
-How many cigarettes do you smoke each day?
-Where do you smoke?
-Does anybody else in your family smoke?

Ex-Smoker questions:
-How old were you when you started smoking?
-How old were you when you stopped smoking?
-How did you feel when you were trying to quit?
-What was your main reasons for quitting?
-Do you feel better now that you have quit?

Please post your answers here or pm me, thanks.</description>

              <p>I know you’ve already had a smoker, but I generally dislike people saying “I started smoking because to look cool” <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>-How old were you when you became a regular smoker? 15<br>
-Why did you start smoking? Curiosity, firstly, then after the first one, enjoyment.<br>
-How many cigarettes do you smoke each day? Varies between a couple and a pack, depending on how many I feel like smoking that day.<br>
-Where do you smoke? Outside, apart from the fact other people don’t enjoy smoke as I do, it’s usually nicer smoking outside anyway.<br>
-Does anybody else in your family smoke? Not direct family, I’m sure someone does somewhere though.</p>

              <p>lets see…<br>
I started smoking when I was 12.<br>
I started smoking because it was a way to get away from everything and it relaxed me.<br>
I probably smoke about three or four cigarettes a day.<br>
I smoke in my house, mostly outside, I don’t like the smell of cigarettes everywhere and my girl friend does like it.<br>
None of my immediate family smokes.</p>
