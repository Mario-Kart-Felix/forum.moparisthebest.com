    <description>Hello everyone, im seeing many people who are looking for a web developer, im not interested in joining a rsps with less than 5 players on their server online everyday, im looking for a server that has atleast 20+ players or less. Here&#39;s what i can do. 

- Code html, year experience.
- Make SMF forums and vbulletin via mysql database.
- Setup vote4cash system, your server must PI
- 30% out of 100 php experience i have.
- 2 years experience with modifying smf forums/IPB/and Vbulletin, i can do alot of work on them and make them look good, ranks/crowns/forum managing and doing daily updates.
- Webclients, if your client is PI, then ill be more than glad to jar it and make it as a webclient on your website.

My name is Anthony, and im 16 years old. Im friendly and i believe i can do alot of work when it comes to website making and forums setting up for an rsps. Whoever is interested and has a server with atleast 15+ players or more. Post here.</description>
