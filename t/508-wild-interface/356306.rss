    <title>[508]wild interface</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-wild-interface/356306</link>
    <description>Ok so im trying to call an interface that shows the skull and crossbones. when you are in wild it says &quot;wild&quot; under it, when in safe it says &quot;safe&quot; under it. i got all this working EXCEPT
iv had 2 problems with this,

1) i have the interfaces called through processes, so it changes as soon as you cross the wild/non wild coords. but everytime it reloads the interface and your right clicked on something, it exits out of the right click box.

2) i changed my code around so it would only call it once but still check for if your in wild non wild
[code]
		if(iswild() == true &amp;&amp; wildface == 0){
		frames.setString(this, &quot;&lt;col=FF0000&gt;Wild&quot;, 380, 1);
		frames.setOverlay(this, 380);
		wildface = 1;
		}else if(iswild() == false &amp;&amp; wildface == 1){
		frames.setString(this, &quot;&lt;col=00FF00&gt;Safe&quot;, 380, 1);
		frames.setOverlay(this, 380);
		wildface = 0;
		}
[/code]
iswild() is where the coords for my wild areas are at
wildface is an INT created to try and fix the first problem i was having, but after doing that i got this problem
right when you log in it doesnt show the interface untill you switch from wild to non wild, and vice versa. 
i know why its doing this im just not sure how to fix it, its doing it because it loads that wildface = 1, as soon as it try&#39;s to load the interface, which causes it to not meet the requirements of showing the interface. It also exits out of the interface when you tele, do to the same problem i just mentioned</description>
