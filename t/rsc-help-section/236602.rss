    <description>I&#39;ve created this section due to the abundance of help topics being created in the development section.

If someone asks a question and you decide to reply, keep your response polite. Nobody forces you to use this section, so using it and failing to comply with my request will result in a warning of some form (handed out at the discretion of the moderator taking action).</description>
