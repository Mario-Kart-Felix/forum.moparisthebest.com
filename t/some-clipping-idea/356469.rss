    <title>Some clipping idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-clipping-idea/356469</link>
    <description>Ok i thought about how to make the best possible way to clip npcs
if its possible to make server read object numbers coded [you know the number of the object] and make object list and make it if object  = id, and that ID will be in the list [no coords nothing just the object ids in the list], and this list make these objects are unwalkable, so if npc is afront of the object the npc cant walk on the object from the ID?

so the idea is to make like unwalkable method that contains all objects list, and make it that npcs cant walk on that objects
I&#39;m not expert in these stuff so i dunno if its possible or not, thats why im asking here its just a question, and if yes we should make it =].

Thanks</description>
