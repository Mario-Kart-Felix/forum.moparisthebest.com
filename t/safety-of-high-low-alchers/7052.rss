    <title>Safety of High/Low Alchers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/safety-of-high-low-alchers/7052</link>
    <description>Hey---I was just wondering about how many of you guys who use the high/low alchers created by scripters on this community have been banned? I really appreciate the scripts, as alching is a very long and tedious burden. I would like to continue using them, but I don&#39;t want to risk my account. Again, thanks to the scripters who aide me in Runescape.</description>

<p>They can be detectable if they don’t check for randoms, or make human like mistakes. Plus I have only seen 2 High/Low alchers on this forum.</p>
<p>Mad Cow’s and Pmh100’s.</p>
<p>Mad Cow says he hasn’t tested his, and I’m pretty sure Pmh has. Though Mad Cow is known to be a very good scripter. Take your pick.</p>
<p>Just remember, if you auto, you have a 20% or so posibility to be banned. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> So don’t forget about the risk…[/quote]I would like to say that if you do it right, you can reduce the to about 10% <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
