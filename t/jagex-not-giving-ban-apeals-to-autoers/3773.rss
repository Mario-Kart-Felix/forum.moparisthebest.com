    <title>Jagex not giving ban apeals to auto&#39;ers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagex-not-giving-ban-apeals-to-autoers/3773</link>
    <description>well jagex updated the apeal page, and a couple of account&#39;s of mine were  banned using aryan, so i thought yesterday i would try an apeal.. so i log in them and all it says is &quot;this account is permanently banned&quot; and thats it!! i asked on the official forums, they didnt know anything about it, this could just be that all aryan accounts that were caught autoing have been deleted, or just not being aloud to apeal. 
looks like im never getting my main back :)</description>

<p>I have like 10 accounts with 60 mining still… Do you think I could get like 25 dollars for all 10 accounts(on another forum <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )?[/quote]</p>

<p>Whine, lie, and make up excuses and you may get them back, they only delete about 10% of the accounts they ban and got appeal for, and 90% of the accounts that haven’t been appealed for.</p>
