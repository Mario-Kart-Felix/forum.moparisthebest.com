<p>you have to look at it this way, once you give permission to drill baby drill, what are those american based oil drilling companies going to do with all that profit?</p>
<p>you frequently say companies shouldn’t be taxed because the companies use it to hire more workers (despite unemployment rates going up, companies laying off workers by the bucketload) and yada-yada, they don’t pass the savings on to the customers by lowering prices, why would oil companies do any different?</p>
<p>EDIT: and I don’t have a source on me, but when domestic drilling in the US started to decline rapidly in the 70s, if the amount of oil produced by the US had any significant effect on petrol prices, surely the petrol prices would have gone up correct? less US drilling, higher prices right? what actually happened was the petrol prices went down by a dollar</p>

<p>Terrible working conditions may be true, but that isn’t the only reason. It’s incredibly expensive to to open up a factory on US soil. They tax everything more heavily than in other countries. Government needs to lighten up on these taxes if we want to see “Made in America” more.</p>

<p>So bad at trolling<br>
[/quote]I’m ProBama. Why would I troll about the truth. Its fact. Look up a list. Bush got us into more national debt by declaring 2 wars in his two terms. Obama is blaimed for putting us into more national debt when the fact is Bush had foreign loans funding our wars which wasn’t effecting the national debt. Once Obama came into office he found where it was coming from and noticed that was a huge no-no and put the funding to the right spot.</p>

<p>Yer, the stimulus package passing congress and then failing was ALL BUSHES FAULT. It’s been four years, what has he accomplished? Gas prices are rising… again, our debt is still outstanding, unemployment is up yet again.</p>

<ol>
<li>The president doesn’t control the gas prices. Hes not to blaim, its the greedy bastards in the east.</li>
<li>Debt is out standing because Bush put us there.</li>
<li>Unemployment isn’t president’s problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>OBAMA would fucking look better if he had the fucking idiots in congress actually doing the right thing. They’re all controlled by money. Our congress sells us out. He proposes proposals to congress and the fat, selfish bastards disagree because they will lose money.</p>
<p>Obama in fact has tried to pull our military out of the middle east but to no avail. Why you may ask? There are republicans in congress who have friends that sell military supplies to the US. If they’re pulled out of the middle east, where will they make their money? Its all about money and thats what the Republican party fails to realize.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>2 years ago he had control of Congress. What did he do? He spent trillions of dollars. Instead of fighting debt, he decides to spend and ungodly amount of money. He said that in his first 6 months of office he would have troops moving out of Iraq and Afghanistan. Lie.</p>
<p>Gas prices are high because Exxon and all these other gas companies are raising prices, Obama should fix that, but he doesn’t.</p>
<p>If Unemployment isn’t his problem, then who’s is it? The American people? Maybe he should lighten up the taxes to companies so they start building factories here instead of over seas. More factories here, more jobs here, unemployment goes down.[/quote]</p>
<p>He had a proportion of the congress on his side 2 years ago, the overall majority were still republicans and it is still this way today.</p>
<p>Obama proposes something, and the stupid republicans in congress reject it because it effects their money situations.</p>
<p>Same as above. He will propose a bill, republicans will lose money through it and denie it. Simple as that.</p>

<li>The president doesn’t control the gas prices. Hes not to blaim, its the greedy bastards in the east.</li>
<li>Debt is out standing because Bush put us there.</li>
<li>Unemployment isn’t president’s problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>OBAMA would fucking look better if he had the fucking idiots in congress actually doing the right thing. They’re all controlled by money. Our congress sells us out. He proposes proposals to congress and the fat, selfish bastards disagree because they will lose money.</p>
<p>Obama in fact has tried to pull our military out of the middle east but to no avail. Why you may ask? There are republicans in congress who have friends that sell military supplies to the US. If they’re pulled out of the middle east, where will they make their money? Its all about money and thats what the Republican party fails to realize.[/quote]</p>
<p>2 years ago he had control of Congress. What did he do? He spent trillions of dollars. Instead of fighting debt, he decides to spend and ungodly amount of money. He said that in his first 6 months of office he would have troops moving out of Iraq and Afghanistan. Lie.</p>
<p>Gas prices are high because Exxon and all these other gas companies are raising prices, Obama should fix that, but he doesn’t.</p>
<p>If Unemployment isn’t his problem, then who’s is it? The American people? Maybe he should lighten up the taxes to companies so they start building factories here instead of over seas. More factories here, more jobs here, unemployment goes down.</p>

There were no foreign loans paying for our wars, do you hear yourself? You sound like me 2 years ago. Why would there be? We come out of wars with market profit any way.<br>
Both wars accumulated $1T each in national debt OVER A DECADE. Obama spent $5T in his 4 years, and it would be more if the mass spending in the first 2 years wasn’t stopped by a house power change. Its a common misconception that the big hunk of debt was cause by Bush. Obama and Clinton didn’t cause it either, it was carters policy that pushed banks to give loans to people who would not normally qualify for loans. Clinton extended this act and saw no harm in it because of the internet boom. When the people who took advantage of these policies couldn’t pay the loans the housing market collapsed and banks foreclosed on a shtiton of houses and put them up at resale for under market value which caused the crash of housing prices (aka housing market, go figure).</p>
<p>Im not probush, and im not probama, in fact I hate almost all leaders and candidates in modern America. But I can’t stand when people hate or praise for the wrong reasons.</p>

So bad at trolling[/quote]I’m ProBama. Why would I troll about the truth. Its fact. Look up a list. Bush got us into more national debt by declaring 2 wars in his two terms. Obama is blaimed for putting us into more national debt when the fact is Bush had foreign loans funding our wars which wasn’t effecting the national debt. Once Obama came into office he found where it was coming from and noticed that was a huge no-no and put the funding to the right spot.</p>
