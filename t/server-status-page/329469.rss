    <description>When I try registering a server to the status page I get the following message:
This new page is beta, servers may be added and deleted while I finish it. Thanks for being patient. Post comments about the new page here.

Welcome andrew4444!
Further Action Required, Read:
New server 2010 Revolution succesfully entered, however it will not show up on the list until it has been verified and approved.
Your server will now be checked by logging into it with the following credentials:
Username:
Password:
to make sure it is online, and if successful, it will be posted.
You must register this username and password for me on your server and allow it to be logged into from the IP 69.39.224.55
The server will be deleted from the queue if not verified and logged into within 24 hours of posting.

The IP address does not match my ip address, which I entered, and I&#39;m a bit confused on what i&#39;m supposed to do, especially since I don&#39;t have any credentials listed to use after registration.</description>
