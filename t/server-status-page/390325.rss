    <description>hey i added my server to server status page.

and this was the message it said

&lt;blockquote&gt;Welcome Knockscape!
Further Action Required, Read:
New server Knockscape 24-7 webclient succesfully entered, however it will not show up on the list until it has been verified and approved.
Your server will now be checked by logging into it with the following credentials: 
Username: TxDxS 
Password: IyuMahn 
to make sure it is online, and if successful, it will be posted. 
You must register this username and password for me on your server and allow it to be logged into from the IP 69.39.224.55
The server will be deleted from the queue if not verified and logged into within 24 hours of posting.

The server you posted, free2pk.no-ip.org, resolves to 88.159.240.69, which does not match your ip, 88.159.242.243. 
This means that you must verify that you own this IP by visiting this URL from the IP that you posted.
If you have a browser on the machine, simply visit the following URL:
http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?action=verify&amp;server=free2pk.no-ip.org&amp;key=aytouNVnLn
If you only have a command line, visit the URL with wget, curl, or an equivalent command to this:

Code:
wget -O- -q &quot;http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?action=verify&amp;server=free2pk.no-ip.org&amp;key=aytouNVnLn&quot;
The message you recieve will tell you if verification was successful.
If you have problems with this, PM Moparisthebest on the forums.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

so i went to my pc registerd it and it said: this server has already been posted, but not yet approved, have some patience.!
