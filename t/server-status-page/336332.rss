    <description>i had a server. then it died, then after some time i added another server but with port 43601, but when i registered it, and it was approved. the port was #43594

im losing time and money and it was my dream 2 make a good rsps server.

i cant do anything and im totally skewd because moparscape added my server with port 43594 instead of 43601 and i specified, i remember specifying and its in my auto complete, the server was submitted with port #43601 but was listed as 43601.

who should i contact to get this fixed?
