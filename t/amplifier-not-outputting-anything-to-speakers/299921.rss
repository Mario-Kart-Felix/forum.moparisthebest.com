    <title>Amplifier not outputting anything to speakers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/amplifier-not-outputting-anything-to-speakers/299921</link>
    <description>Hello.

I just installed a new deck into my car ([url=http://www.crutchfield.ca/Sony_CDX_GT430IP_CD_Receiver_p/158GT430IP.htm]View[/url])

Now, I purchased a small 240w. amp ([url=http://www.pyramidcaraudio.com/itempage.asp?model=PB110PX]View[/url]). I installed it in the boot of the car. I grounded it, ran the power &amp; remote leads. That&#39;s all working perfectly. 

Then I hooked up the two RCA cables to the Sub/Rear RCA port on the deck, and the low input on the aplifier. This is also working as when one is unplugged on either end the amp will shut down until the connection is re-established.

Now, here&#39;s the problem. I have two oval (Not 100 % sure of the size, their not huge or anything) speakers that I am hooking up. I have cut the proper length of speaker wire, I have added clips for the end to connect to the &#39;ports&#39; on the amplifier. I checked the speakers (As they are mounted in box&#39;s) to make sure the input from the box to the speaker is proper, and both are. But, when hooked up, and the amp is powered on, and music is playing, nothing comes out of these speakers.

I have tested the speakers on my home theater, and they work fine there. I have also tried changing settings on the deck (Changed from sub to rear, then vice versa) but that did not work either.

Does anyone have any idea what exactly is going on?

Thanks for reading.</description>

<p>Yea, I think that this may be the cause of the problem. I am going to re-wire everything tomorrow.</p>

<p>I did, same thing.</p>
<p>Question: Could the remote be feeding it a bit of power to turn the LED on? Maybe the main power lead has a problem with it.</p>
