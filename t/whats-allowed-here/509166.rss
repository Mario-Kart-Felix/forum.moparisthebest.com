    <description>This is a new board relating to guides that users can post for RS2007. You&#39;re generally allowed to post any form of guide in here at all, as long as it relates to the game itself, if your guide is for EoC RuneScape, visit [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,254.0.html]this board[/url] and post it there instead. Please make your post as informative as possible, not just a 5 line thread telling someone to do this or that. [b]Do not request a guide in here[/b], this is only for the posting of guides, not the requesting. If the guide is not your work give credits where it&#39;s due otherwise it will be locked, these rules are to be used in compliance with the [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,354311.0.html]global rules[/url] just like every other board.
