    <title>[PI] Attempting to open my JAR client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-attempting-to-open-my-jar-client/529010</link>
    <description>Okay, so I have been at this for a little while now and I can&#39;t seem to figure out the problem.
I JAR everything correctly, but then when attempting to load the .jar file I get a Java exception error and I don&#39;t know what to do to fix the error since it doesn&#39;t really tell me much of anything.  :palm:
Here is the error:
[code]
Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Client (wrong name: com/Client)
        at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)
        at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(Unknown Source)
        at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(Unknown Source)

        at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source)
        at sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.checkAndLoadMain(Unknown Source)
Press any key to continue . . .
[/code]
It says wrong name, but that is exactly what it is named (uppercase C and not lowercase is correct as well).
My environmental variables are all set correctly etc...Any help is much appreciated. Thank you. :)
If you need any extra info. please ask and I will post it up ASAP.

Also, while looking into things I noticed most clients have an EGUI or GUI or something of the sort, but mine has neither. Could that maybe be the issue here? I wouldn&#39;t think so since the client loads just fine from a batch file and from Eclipse.
And if I put the jar client in Eclipse I can run it just fine, but I can&#39;t run it outside of Eclipse. :\

I suppose nobody looks to help people out in the Client Help section then :&#39;(..
I attempted to JAR a completely different client just to make sure I was doing it right, and it worked 100% no problems. But the client/source I have been working on for a little while now doesn&#39;t want to work correctly. &gt;.&lt; Really frustrated and the problem seems so simple yet can&#39;t figure out how to fix or what to do. I tried every little thing I could think of. PLEASE HELP ME.


Fixed this on my own at last, still wish I got help from the community. But maybe with my new found knowledge I can help others with the same problem in the future. :\</description>
