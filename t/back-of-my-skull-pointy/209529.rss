    <title>Back of my skull... pointy?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/back-of-my-skull-pointy/209529</link>
    <description>I swear lots of stuff is weird about my skeletal system. My right leg points outwards, so when I am standing normally my left foot is fine but my right foot points a good 30degrees outwards. Also my ribs are uneven, when I press against the bottom ribs with both my hands I can feel that my right rib is significantly differently shaped from the left.

Anyways the other day I was laying across susie&#39;s lap on the train and had my head rested against the window pain. It was very painful to lay the back of my head against the window. I felt the back of my head and realised my skull actually has a point in it :S.

So what I was wondering is; is this normal? Does anyone else have this? I&#39;ve felt other random peoples heads and they don&#39;t have this as far as I can tell.

Thanks lol.</description>

However, there is the potential that your spine has gone fully “out-of-wack” and you need to see a chiropractor to fix it up.  I’m just stating some possible answers.  But it you’re really that worried about it, talk to your doctor about it; I’m sure he/she would be able to tell you a lot more then any of us here can.[/quote]He shouldn’t be worried about it. I have it, too. Which must mean we’re far superior from the rest.</p>

              <p>Well yeah that could affect it quite alot since afaik it takes quite a few years for the skull plates to properly fuse. So you would probably still have been at risk of changing it’s shape in the event of a heavy knock.</p>

<p>Also a probable factor could have been when I split my head open by banging my head on a shelf when i was 4.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how bad it was because I can’t remember that far back but I had to go to hospital.</p>

              <p>Skulls are formed during infancy, you will notice no-one ever has a perfectly shaped skull, infact you would notice them because they’d look quite odd.</p>
<p>When babies are born the plates which make up the skull are not joined, this is so it easier at child birth as they can literally squash together as the child is born. When you were younger if you tended to sleep on one side as a baby that side would become somewhat flat. It’s these sort of habits that determine the shape of your skull… now-a-days doctors try to get mothers to influence it by various methods I’m not going to go into.</p>
<p>So basically, it could just be from childhood, how you slept. The other things about the joints etc is more common in people who inbreed :p. I know a guy with both legs and arms pointing outwards and he has no joint what-so-ever in his thumbs <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>I swear lots of stuff is weird about my skeletal system. My right leg points outwards, so when I am standing normally my left foot is fine but my right foot points a good 30degrees outwards. Also my ribs are uneven, when I press against the bottom ribs with both my hands I can feel that my right rib is significantly differently shaped from the left.</p>
<p>Anyways the other day I was laying across susie’s lap on the train and had my head rested against the window pain. It was very painful to lay the back of my head against the window. I felt the back of my head and realised my skull actually has a point in it :S.</p>
<p>So what I was wondering is; is this normal? Does anyone else have this? I’ve felt other random peoples heads and they don’t have this as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>Thanks lol.</p>
