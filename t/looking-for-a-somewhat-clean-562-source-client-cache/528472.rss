“Clean” means has the bare bones (It runs.).<br>
“new project” means that you want something that you want to <span class="bbcode-b">work</span> on.<br>
You just commented saying you want “100% combat and all skills” that is neither of the above.<br>
Changing names, redoing shops, and stupid small things like that is NOT a project nor clean.[/quote]</p>
<p>I said <em>SOMEWHAT</em> clean. I’m not sure if you know what that word means, but the definition is:</p>
<p>To a moderate extent or by a moderate amount</p>
<p>Or, not completely. Just because I want combat added, doesn’t mean all I want to do is edit things. There is SO many more options in this brain of mine besides just ‘editing’ or ‘changing names’. Please, think about that</p>

<p>So you want everything done for you?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>What kind of stupid question is this !?</p>
<p>He just want to have a great source where he can fight and skill in , alone or with hes brother or sister…</p>
<p>What you really say here =“So you want everything done for you?” is SPAM.</p>
<p>There are alot of people who have made a source and are willing to give them the opportunity to download them…[/quote]</p>
<p>It isn’t a stupid question, your post is a stupid post.</p>
<p>He wants a great source to play alone or with his brother did you even read his post? He wants it for a project.</p>
<p>Someone gave him a perfectly fine source, but he doesn’t want to invest time into it to make it better (but isn’t that what you want to do if you are going to work on a project)?</p>
<p>Get off his D.</p>
