    <title>What we need : About Object-Oriented-Programming</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-we-need-about-object-oriented-programming/378136</link>
    <description>To me, private servers are dying. Slowly, people are becoming far more dependent on &quot;Help&quot; sections rather than learning on their own, which on a larger scale leads to a slower advancement of private servers in general. Over the past few years, servers have been taken on a skyrocket. Four years ago a server with magic spells was epic, a server with a mini-game was the best. As time progressed, the community learned more as a whole. People had to rely on themselves, as most others were on the same &quot;level&quot; of experience as they were, and from this came more intelligent beings. While servers progressed, one had &#39;less&#39; to do, as servers were becoming more complete (or more fulfilling) as RuneScape, and with the addition of constant help (truly spoon-feeding the answers) the community has been drawn downward in advancement. More and more users are downloading servers with a lot of content, and with so, the &#39;owners&#39; or &#39;administration&#39; of the servers don&#39;t even need to go as far as adding a tutorial. How could one learn without making any modifications?

Development needs to increase. Jagex laughs at us. Private servers are all the &quot;same&quot; now, which is why most of the experienced developers are quitting. Constant battles as to &quot;who&#39;s better&quot; take place daily, which only causes more of a slow-down to RSPS advancement. If people are going to develop private servers, they need to understand OOP (object-oriented-programming), which can&#39;t be truly &quot;taught&quot; to one. People should understand the basic concepts of OOP at the age of 10. Everything in an environment (the Earth) is an object of some sort, whether it be flowers, trees, people, cities, atoms, WHATEVER! Many things in our world can contain another. A school can contain classes, which can contain students, and so forth. Not only does our world have object-containing objects, however TONS of objects have sub-objects. A student is a sub-object of a citizen, which may be a sub-object of a human, which may be a sub-object of a mob (mobile entity),  which is a sub-object of an entity (anything that exists). It all relates to real-world, which is why programming in OOP is extremely simple yet powerful as well. In the real-world, we have blueprints for lots of stuff, and when speaking in OOP terms, these are called interfaces. There are a number of situations in software engineering when it is important for disparate groups of programmers to agree to a &quot;contract&quot; that spells out how their software interacts. Each group should be able to write their code without any knowledge of how the other group&#39;s code is written. Generally speaking, interfaces are such contracts. For example, imagine a futuristic society where computer-controlled robotic cars transport passengers through city streets without a human operator. Automobile manufacturers write software (Java, of course) that operates the automobile—stop, start, accelerate, turn left, and so forth. Another industrial group, electronic guidance instrument manufacturers, make computer systems that receive GPS (Global Positioning System) position data and wireless transmission of traffic conditions and use that information to drive the car. The auto manufacturers must publish an industry-standard interface that spells out in detail what methods can be invoked to make the car move (any car, from any manufacturer). The guidance manufacturers can then write software that invokes the methods described in the interface to command the car. Neither industrial group needs to know how the other group&#39;s software is implemented. In fact, each group considers its software highly proprietary and reserves the right to modify it at any time, as long as it continues to adhere to the published interface. As we know, everything in our world also have attributes. As an example, a flower some attributes like color, name, size, petals, location, and ect. Just like the real-world, this can be done in OOP. Every attribute is a &quot;type&quot; with certain &quot;modifiers&quot; (conditions) of who has access to it, and ect. Let&#39;s start out with the most easy-to-relate-to &quot;type&quot; (data type) called an &quot;integer&quot;. An &quot;integer&quot;, as we know from math, is any positive or negative whole number. So as an example, a flower has an attribute petals which is set to 5, meaning the flower has 5 petals.

              <p>Honestly Most People on this site don’t know how to “CODE” they basically download source’s and change the names. If you go on the top list of lets say Runelocus I promise you all those servers are probably in the last couple of pages, just with a different owner. The reason RSPS is dieing is because they’re aren’t really “CODERS” anymore basically everything is a leech I remember when there was NO Moparscape those were the days, No Leechs, Real Coders…</p>

              <p>Canownueazy, you made some wonderful points with your post. I’m not going to write this acting like I’m amazing at programming servers, or that I am an old timer with this website, because I’m not. Although I have spent half a year learning java and working on projects. So to a certain extent I know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>I haven’t been around awhile like I said, but I can clearly see what’s going on here. Hardly anything is unique anymore. People are becoming very dependent on help from other people (I know I’m just restating the things you guys have said).</p>
<p>A big portion of this I believe is the whole rep++ part of the website. Taking this away will remove the motivation for a lot of people to help others, but it would be nice to have a section devoted to people with a certain amount of rep or so, I don’t know which would be better.</p>
<p>After reading this post, I realized I’ve been “feeding” this problem. I’m not helping at all by helping people in the help section. There are plenty of resources out there already. It’s the damn internet. I appreciate you posting this again canownueazy, as of now I don’t think I’ll be helping people with these retarded issues anymore.</p>

<p>That made no sense.  And no, you cannot complain.  It’s a waste of time and really shows how arrogant you are.  And if any of you wanted to help them, then you should actually help them, or let them figure it out.  Both give a nice little boost in knowledge.<br>

Well, I wasn’t even talking about code snippets.  By “actually help them”, I literally meant walk them through whatever you give them.  And usually the ones who take code snippets without returning a thanks or asking how that specific piece works are the hopeless ones, however I’m still supporting my own point.</p>

<p>I support this ideology completely, it’ s just common sense. The only problem is that the Wl/Delta cookie cutters will never be banned from the download section. If that was so, Moparscape would easily lose a large percentage of its community, and I don’ t know how the staff would handle that sort of effect. The only thing we can do is stop spoon feeding the leeching idiots, and hope they either move on to other things or actually make an effort to learn a programming language. This thread was very inspirational and appreciate your time and effort spent on typing it, thank you.</p>

<p>Well we cant stop them like that too however, because idiots spoonfeed them, and encourage laziness, they go to the help section for the SIMPLEST of things, such as :“NEED HELP URGENT!”<br>

              <p>I support this ideology completely, it’ s just common sense. The only problem is that the Wl/Delta cookie cutters will never be banned from the download section. If that was so, Moparscape would easily lose a large percentage of its community, and I don’ t know how the staff would handle that sort of effect. The only thing we can do is stop spoon feeding the leeching idiots, and hope they either move on to other things or actually make an effort to learn a programming language. This thread was very inspirational and appreciate your time and effort spent on typing it, thank you.</p>

              <p>I think one way to stop all these crap server making/9 year old staff hunters and get out is to clear out ALL servers from status pages, and there should be a section for every major status page (MSCP, RL, R-S) were you have to apply your server and it has to be approved by moderators, stopping “9 YEAR OLD PWNAGE SCAPE FIRST WUN IN GETS ADMUN JOIN NAO!”, or server downloads must be approved to, and all those delta servers/ WL servers would be dissaproved, and things like hyperion, rune-source would only be approved, stopping all the 9 year olds, because they wont be able to understand it, but this is just my opinion…</p>
