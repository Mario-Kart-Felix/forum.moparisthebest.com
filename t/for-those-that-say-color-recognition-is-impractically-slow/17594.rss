              <p>Sorry for bumping an old thread  (;D) but, just to clear things up, semaphore did post the general (however highly specific) idea of how a spline based mouse mover would work. However, since all of the code was 100% mine and much of the origional design was lost in the development process, i did not leave any credits to anyone. The point still remains that semaphore is, as far as i know, the only one posting that has any idea how my splines work :P. And, while i’m ranting and raving, people got banned with other mouse movement algorithms also didn’t they  :eek: (to whoever brought up that point ;))<br>

              <p>As I understand it, it all has to do with your SecurityManager settings, java has one set of settings it uses for an unsigned applet, and another set of settings, almost identical to the rights and privelages of an application, for a signed applet.</p>
<p>So it doesnt matter whether you load the unsigned or signed client into your AppletStub because what it can or can’t do all depends on the custom SecurityManager you assign to it.</p>
<p>I believe this is a correct statement so can we stop arguing about fact now? It is pretty stupid to argue over a fact.</p>

Ruler, it gives the applet the same power if it’s run within an application. Just because it’s unsigned means nothing, if it can access your computer, IT WILL AND DOES. Have you even looked a deob?<br>

<p>want a test? i sugest for you to make a simple thing that prints out your UID, load it as a unsigned applet and see if it can print out your UID from you computer off of the file.</p>

<p>They actually are separate people (Eric and Mark Snellman, I believe). At least, Eric/ruler is real; I can’t verify Mark’s existence as there are no inherently accurate records of him. I suppose you can use the phrase “alter ego” to describe people with equivalent viewpoints and actions, but it’s prone to misinterpretation.</p>

<p>Also how weird after the mass ban ppl could still bot even while as you said they were processing every mouse packet.  Every mouse packet from aryan was bascially instant ban once processed.  The trick was not to get flagged/pray.  It was eaiser when one knew when they were flagged.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If I remember correctly, all that the “flagged” logging sent was a hash of the coordinates of a click and its distance from the previous click. I haven’t looked at the code in quite a while, but the secret would seem to be a system of mouse control that does not look suspicious to the client.</p>

<p>I dont think the loader is a issue.  Then again i do not know much about the Loader</p>
<p>pplsqlballz component.getBounds() refers the bounds in refrence to the container, also they dont call it in the UNsigned</p>
<p>Taios, the InetAddress.getLocalHost() is only called in main(), you had me worried lol</p>

<p>The things that they may use to detect me are:</p>
<p>getFrames() result:<br>
sun.awt.windows.WEmbeddedFrame[frame0,0,0,764x503,invalid,layout=java.awt.BorderLayout,title=,resizable,normal]<br>
(I think my result is the same as Internet Explorer but if it is not, i can change the toString())</p>
<p>Circumvent a over-ridden Security Manager and test the real permissions.<br>
System.getSecurityManager().getSecurityContext().checkPermission();</p>
<p>However i can’t find any traps with me currently, but i am nub.  Also i am sure any methods of dectability they produce can be battled.</p>
