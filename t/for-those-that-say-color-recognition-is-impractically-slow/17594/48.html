        <p>[quote=“Pwnd, post:43, topic:17594”]ScarX told SCAR where to put the mouse, bot-like.<br>
It was a seperate API, having it’s own SCAR functions and procedures.[br][size=1]Posted at: October 18, 2006, 05:33:27 AM[/size][hr]HE R SPIE[/quote]</p>
<p>OK here ill explain ti to you in easy nub terms.</p>
<p>“ScarX told SCAR where to put the mouse, bot-like.” -pwnd<br>
A java client edit telling scar where to put the mouse? Most retarded thing ever. Why didnt the java bot jsut manipulate the mouse more effectivly.<br>
note: ScarX told scar to do stuff</p>
<p>I thought you were talking aobut XScar from the begining. XScar can be compared to UBI cause it was the same thing.<br>
note: XScar and UBI were told to do stuff.</p>
<p>Both XScar and UBI moved the mouse and did it without taking your normal cursor over. ScarX took the cursor from what you said as it TOLD SCAR where to move it. really crappy.</p>
<p>now to comapre XScar and UBI…<br>
XScar was a client edit thus it has its detectability and failures from client chanes from that.<br>
UBI was external the same concept runs the mouse in I Bot.</p>
<p>whenever rs updated XScar had to be, UBI still runs for me whens the last time you ran XScar?</p>
<p>back to ScarX. i have lost rep/respect for semawhore cause he/she didnt make a fake mouse and its a java client edit I know it’s a good java programmer capable of it. LOL. pwnd go ahead try to respond and dig yourself a deeper hole.</p>
<p>So what bot are you going to ty and bash I Bot with next that is “better” than it? Here is some… err or wait NONE of any bot EVER has done anything near to what I Bot does. I Bot covers everything without the problem of having to be updated weekly cause of rs updates. Its like blade it has the powerful everlasting life(like a vampire) but not the weakness of not being able to go into sunlight(like humans).</p>

        <p>ruler… genodemon… whichever alter-ego you decide to manifest with today. It’s clear you are the same person.</p>
<p>You have proven the adage that it is better to be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.</p>
<p>After translating the last post from your obscure dialect of ebonics into readable English, I was amused to see the insult. Your recollection of history is quite astounding. You got the names right… but that is more or less where the facts end.</p>
<p>I have never heard of ScarX. Doesn’t really mean anything, I had never heard of UBI either until you vomitted it into this conversation. I had nothing to do with anything named ‘scarx’. I wrote the client for xscar and I made sure that it did not automatically update purposefully. UBI may have been a good application. I really don’t care. xscar was never meant to be anything more than a tool to be used by SCAR. It was never trumped up as anything more than that. Really, you wouldn’t go around attacking a screwdriver because it makes a terrible hammer would you?</p>
<p>Incidentally I find it interesting that you have the notion that an internal client ‘has its detectability and failures’ just by virtue of the fact that it is an internal client. I think much can be said of your real ability versus the ability you wish to portray only when one analyzes your comment. It’s simple, your thought pattern is ‘I cannot do it therefore no one can’. Again, I’ll pointedly disagree with you on that. It’s been done. It’s being done. People have been doing it since early June (possibly earlier).</p>
<p>Let’s move onto the topic of what you so ingeniously dubbed ‘fake mouse’. The reason I gave my mouse moving routine to RichyT and not to the leeches of the world is simple; I am under no obligation to share my work-product with anyone. It’s mine. I’ll do with it whatever I bloody please. If that upsets you, good. Go write your own. If you have, congratulations, you aren’t as dumb as you type. Besides, RichyT proved to me that he actually did something. I had respect for his system. On that same note, I did release my mouse moving algorithm. I didn’t give the code out, but I gave out exactly how it is to be done. In fact, Benland took what I posted and wrote probably the best mouse moving library SCAR has ever had.</p>
<p>One more thing. You will notice that those with real systems do not have to go around trying to puff their systems up at the expense of someone else. I would have thought that you may have learned that in Grade 1 or maybe earlier.</p>
<p>You called me a whore in your last post. If you and I were equals, it may have bothered me. The fact is, kid, you aren’t even a blip on anyone’s radar. I’m comforted by the fact that I don’t have to worry about any real competition for resources from you or anyone else that uses your system.</p>
<p>I bot is a cute project. I would be proud of it too if I were you.</p>

<p>“ScarX told SCAR where to put the mouse, bot-like.” -pwnd<br>
A java client edit telling scar where to put the mouse? Most retarded thing ever. Why didnt the java bot jsut manipulate the mouse more effectivly.<br>
note: ScarX told scar to do stuff</p>
<p>I thought you were talking aobut XScar from the begining. XScar can be compared to UBI cause it was the same thing.<br>
note: XScar and UBI were told to do stuff.</p>
<p>Both XScar and UBI moved the mouse and did it without taking your normal cursor over. ScarX took the cursor from what you said as it TOLD SCAR where to move it. really crappy.</p>
<p>now to comapre XScar and UBI…<br>
XScar was a client edit thus it has its detectability and failures from client chanes from that.<br>
UBI was external the same concept runs the mouse in I Bot.</p>
<p>whenever rs updated XScar had to be, UBI still runs for me whens the last time you ran XScar?</p>
<p>back to ScarX. i have lost rep/respect for semawhore cause he/she didnt make a fake mouse and its a java client edit I know it’s a good java programmer capable of it. LOL. pwnd go ahead try to respond and dig yourself a deeper hole.</p>
<p>So what bot are you going to ty and bash I Bot with next that is “better” than it? Here is some… err or wait NONE of any bot EVER has done anything near to what I Bot does. I Bot covers everything without the problem of having to be updated weekly cause of rs updates. Its like blade it has the powerful everlasting life(like a vampire) but not the weakness of not being able to go into sunlight(like humans).[/quote]</p>
<p>Geno. Ibot is detected as i have already explained to ruler. I think he will be sorting it.</p>
<p>Geno, not all java bots are detected. Yes ARGA is, yes we know means of making it much more undetected. Not all client hacks are by means detected either, i suggest you go learn some bytecode or java or learn more about the client and then comment. By this comment i am not implying that i know everything about client hacking, just to make that clear <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/winkc164.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>If your patterns and hooks are done well enough then updating is no problem.</p>

Java client edit telling SCAR where to put the mouse.  - Retarded.
XScar, a 'Java client edit', "told scar to do stuff" - Not retarded.
I like your contridictions.
<p>Also, why is it that Geno can competently type some of the time?  Did you get smart somehow?  Or is Ruler just trying to show off his own balls in another suit?</p>
<p>IBot is as detectable as it would be if it was a ‘Java client edit.’  The fact is that it all depends on how you load and manage your client.</p>

        <p>on what basis can you conclude we are the same? come on vent sometime. i dont think anyone can do 2 voices.</p>
<p>“ScarX, or whatever it was (Semaphore’s project) got information from the client.” -pwnd<br>
“ScarX told SCAR where to put the mouse, bot-like.” -pwnd<br>
thats how scarx came up. seems like pwnd was 100% mistaken then how it worked.</p>
<p>“Incidentally I find it interesting that you have the notion that an internal client ‘has its detectability and failures’ just by virtue of the fact that it is an internal client. I think much can be said of your real ability versus the ability you wish to portray only when one analyzes your comment. It’s simple, your thought pattern is ‘I cannot do it therefore no one can’. Again, I’ll pointedly disagree with you on that. It’s been done. It’s being done. People have been doing it since early June (possibly earlier).”<br>
– yes but not on a public scale. once it goes public and jagex can see themseleves how you did it there will be a fix. like d2 dupes for example worked for months privately then days after being public they break.</p>
<p>“Let’s move onto the topic of what you so ingeniously dubbed ‘fake mouse’. The reason I gave my mouse moving routine to RichyT and not to the leeches of the world is simple; I am under no obligation to share my work-product with anyone. It’s mine. I’ll do with it whatever I bloody please. If that upsets you, good. Go write your own. If you have, congratulations, you aren’t as dumb as you type. Besides, RichyT proved to me that he actually did something. I had respect for his system. On that same note, I did release my mouse moving algorithm. I didn’t give the code out, but I gave out exactly how it is to be done. In fact, Benland took what I posted and wrote probably the best mouse moving library SCAR has ever had.”<br>
– you wrote a mouse routine was that a part of XScar? if benland’s routine is soo godo then why have people gotten banned using it(without anything like mod interacting etc. in scar)?</p>
<p>“One more thing. You will notice that those with real systems do not have to go around trying to puff their systems up at the expense of someone else. I would have thought that you may have learned that in Grade 1 or maybe earlier.”<br>
– no i dont go around and puff it up. pwnd said it was crap and gave an example of soemthing he thought was better so i have to rebute it.</p>
<p>“You called me a whore in your last post. If you and I were equals, it may have bothered me. The fact is, kid, you aren’t even a blip on anyone’s radar. I’m comforted by the fact that I don’t have to worry about any real competition for resources from you or anyone else that uses your system.”<br>
– so you’ve seen the new guy cool. you ar the real blimp. you could have coded 10,000’s of lines of code but never realsed 1 and you think your the shit but no-1 knows. I have never seen one macro bot or script that you have used. mabey you sucked some cock off of irc from some forum admin thus i dubbed you ‘whore’. Its sad how you have no creativity and that you have to anme yourself like regex after some coding operation cause you think your soo leet. I have no respect from any of you “high ups” cause of a few things, i have always been for profit why else waste my time. I have always squashed scammers when i’ve had te chance, many ex-scammers( i doubt they are ex) are admins mods etc or other people you call respectable. dis yourself a deeper hole pelase.</p>
<p>“I bot is a cute project. I would be proud of it too if I were you.”<br>
– ok you leave for 1 month or realsed your bot for 1 month adn we’ll see.</p>

<p>"2. Load Up - <span class="bbcode-b">Get the loader</span>.</p>
<p>The new engine/loader was fun to break. Get to know how the new loader works. There are <span class="bbcode-b">traps they put into the new loading mechanism</span> that are not immediately apparent, and unless you <span class="bbcode-b">know java classloading more than casually</span>, you <span class="bbcode-b">will get caught/flagged/noticed</span>. One thing to keep in mind is that the UID is generated/accessed very early in the loading phase. I will emphasize this again: It is very important that you know intimately which classes are REALLY being loaded… the consequences can be worse than soloing Azuregos."<br>
^^ Semaphore.</p>
<p>Also, go look at Bash’s Aryan resurection and look at <span class="bbcode-b">HOW</span> he loads the client.</p>
<p>And Geno. By updating you mean by getting the client objects, fields. Yeah we have to update. We are also happy that it takes between 2000 Millseconds - 11000 Mills to update depending on your machine. (these time’s could actually be improved also because of how we do the transforms)This is done at runtime when you load so it wont effect the user unless the bytecode patterns break, which i must say, they break far less than Regex patterns.</p>

I can.</p>
<p>“thats how scarx came up. seems like pwnd was 100% mistaken then how it worked.”<br>
So, you quote me twice and try to tell me I’m wrong?  Good job, Geno/Ruler.  You’ve, again, proven how retarded you are.</p>
<p>“-- yes but not on a public scale. once it goes public and jagex can see themseleves how you did it there will be a fix. like d2 dupes for example worked for months privately then days after being public they break.”<br>
It’s all a matter of how you code it.  You could have ideas unimaginable by any of the Jagex coding staff.  They could recognize that much, yes, but how to get it out of buisness?  Another story.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Pwnd, post:57, topic:17594”]Geno obviously doesn’t know who Semaphore is, let alone what a semaphore is in general.</p>
<p>“i dont think anyone can do 2 voices.”<br>
I can.</p>
<p>“thats how scarx came up. seems like pwnd was 100% mistaken then how it worked.”<br>
So, you quote me twice and try to tell me I’m wrong?  Good job, Geno/Ruler.  You’ve, again, proven how retarded you are.</p>
<p>“-- yes but not on a public scale. once it goes public and jagex can see themseleves how you did it there will be a fix. like d2 dupes for example worked for months privately then days after being public they break.”<br>
It’s all a matter of how you code it.  You could have ideas unimaginable by any of the Jagex coding staff.  They could recognize that much, yes, but how to get it out of buisness?  Another story.</p>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Semaphore (programming)</a></h3>

<p>In computer science, a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to a common resource by multiple processes in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system. A semaphore is simply a variable. This variable is used to solve critical section problems and to achieve process synchronization in the multi processing environment. A trivial semaphore is a plain variable that is changed (for example, incremented or decremented, or toggled) depending on programmer-d...</p>

        <p>Taios, yes their a spot in the public one that might be dectable, they probably aren’t watching the field.  Writing the private one to be exactly like ie.</p>
<p>Also me and Genodemon are brothers.  I have been around for a year, genodemon been around longer then most if not all of you.</p>
<p>If your now saying benland ripped your idea your amazing me.  Very odd bc i seem to remember benlands produre being out first also if my laptop comp’s cord was not broken i could show you parts of it that were matches to the one in sbot3.</p>
<p>You and pplsuqbawlz take credit for everything that is brought up and when one brings up a issue in a system all of the sudden that part is not yours. (xscar) If one traced back all these claim to invention you proliferate it would appear everything in rs2 cheating was done first by you two.  The rest just leech and steal your ideas right?  The fact is your name dosn’t appear on the credits.  Both of you need to get use to that and stop telling people mis-truths.<br>
Re-Visionist Historian now that benland is not around and now that his posts in kait cm no longer exist.  Already seeing instances of pplsqlballz saying he was a aryan dev to kiddies at Sythe.</p>
<p>I judge people on who their friends are.  You semphore are friends with pplsuqbawlz and RichyT which i have proved numerous times to be liers.</p>
<p>It is unlucky for you that i know history.</p>
<p>Any more posts from Pwnd will be reported.  they seem to be incorrect, non-constructive.</p>

Semaphore’s never came out ;(</p>

If you weren’t as blind as your dumb ass brother you’d know that Semaphore isn’t even making claims as such.  It’s not even possible as he wasn’t even with Kait’s community as long as me even.</p>
