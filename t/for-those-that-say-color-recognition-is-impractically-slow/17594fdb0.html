<p>If your now saying benland ripped your idea your amazing me.  Very odd bc i seem to remember benlands produre being out first also if my laptop comp’s cord was not broken i could show you parts of it that were matches to the one in sbot3.</p>
<p>You and pplsuqbawlz take credit for everything that is brought up and when one brings up a issue in a system all of the sudden that part is not yours. (xscar) If one traced back all these claim to invention you proliferate it would appear everything in rs2 cheating was done first by you two.  The rest just leech and steal your ideas right?  The fact is your name dosn’t appear on the credits.  Both of you need to get use to that and stop telling people mis-truths.<br>
Re-Visionist Historian now that benland is not around and now that his posts in kait cm no longer exist.  Already seeing instances of pplsqlballz saying he was a aryan dev to kiddies at Sythe.</p>
<p>I judge people on who their friends are.  You semphore are friends with pplsuqbawlz and RichyT which i have proved numerous times to be liers.</p>
<p>It is unlucky for you that i know history.</p>
<p>Any more posts from Pwnd will be reported.  they seem to be incorrect, non-constructive.</p>

Semaphore’s never came out ;(</p>

If you weren’t as blind as your dumb ass brother you’d know that Semaphore isn’t even making claims as such.  It’s not even possible as he wasn’t even with Kait’s community as long as me even.</p>

        <p>I’ve never accused benland of ‘ripping’ anything. I simply said that he acknowledged the idea was mine.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if you remember but benland gave me full credit for what he came up with. Benland was I believe a CM at kaits, you could ask anyone that was a CM at kaits, they would remember the litany of posts about it. Benland was always cool about saying the whole idea came from my suggestions. I don’t remember seeing either of your alter-egos there, but then again, I barely talked to people that actualy knew how to code, people that didn’t know a semaphore from their mommy’s brownies didn’t usually hear from me much.</p>
<p>But, credit isn’t something I really care about. I am not defined by the community. I come here for entertainment. You have definitely entertained me. Your emotion and lack of eloquence shows that you really have a fire inside. Hopefully you will take that and become something.</p>
<p>I’ll take you on your accusation. I dare you to find one single lie that I have told.</p>
<p>Incidentally, pplsuqbawlz may be known to… stretch the truth at times. I have had disagreements with him in the past. He’s manipulative at times. All in all though, from what I’ve gotten from him is that he’s a good loyal friend. If you are ignorant, he’ll flame you. The worst thing about pplsuqbawlz is that he is epitomizingly lazy. He has basically turned it into an artform.</p>
<p>As for RichyT, I didn’t know him when he turned to whatever heinous crime he may have committed against you. I met him because I cracked sbot3 and wanted to tell him what the security holes were. That got us on the conversation that led to me giving him a version of my mouse movement code.</p>
<p>I don’t think that company is too bad. Aside from personality quirks that we all have, decent human beings. You really should lighten up a little bit kid.</p>

        <p>I was a cm at kait.  I guess you dont remember me, i had 175 rep but i was a aryan scripter.  Also please hang-up the idea of alter-egos.  Unless you want me to start saying pplsuqbawlzi is your alter-ego.   Their is no credit to you in any of the code from benland.  I got it directly from the cm at the time.</p>
<p>In kait cm you told everyone that jagex is now processing every mouse packet.  This is un true they instead just moved flagging from the client and on to the server.</p>
<p>You also say you work for Jagex?</p>
<p>No mention of you on this cache, i can’t get he orignal kait cm post.<br>

Semaphore’s never came out ;(<br>
if it never came out then it NEVER existed. no proof thus its only vaporware. id rather believe that ar2 was comming out then that load of bs. atm.</p>
<p>Taios – thats was my gf’s dog then she had to give it away cause she found out he was heavily alergic to dogs and she had a asmha attack that put her in the hospital er for about 8 hours in the middle of the night so dont dare go there. onto other things so what my myspace is open go ahead go there. I dont use a computer as a means to hide my insecurities. taois why dont you go outside your house for once and get fucked like all the real woman out there or are your boobs too small that no-1 would even take a second look. even pwnd has one and im his friend on myspace or impsoft was dont rember, hes quite odd looking.</p>
<p>pplsuqbawlz-- lol post your myspace or subsequent alternative i dare you to grow the balls. same to you taois. its funny how you only way to attack me is childish remarks about my gf. shallw e delve into you help sythe keylogg accounts using scarscape. thats why sythe has toh ave it hosted off of a server so he can logg every rs account and steal items from oens that have alot. You have never done 1 thing to help the communities mabey you sohuld start now.</p>
<p>Pwnd-- i posted the quote agian cause it appears semawhore missed it the first time.</p>
<p>Pwnd#2–neonknight wasnt a bitch. allh e ever did for us was cause trouble and help sell auths and he was paid to sell auths, we took shit for him that shouldnt have had to of been and since he has been cut.</p>
<p>to all go ahead insult me on my spelling i dont have a million years to type up a response. all i ask is for you to tpye a real response with real information like i;ve done the duty to you.</p>

ya i know you gave a .java version of them to neonknight unfortantly that never worked correctly, never figure out why.  I ended up converting the scar one from cm kait.  Actually i think it was some order of operation issues in the end.  Anyone that tried to implmenting the java one would know what i am talking about.  Benland never tested his java implemenation.<br>
Also i had to add things like speed modualtion, features that all the others lack.  Also added bounds for menu clicking ect.</p>

        <p>Heh.</p>
<p>First, if my memory serves me correctly, that was just before the huge ban. And at the time, the flag was turned on for every single account. And every single mouse movement wasn’t recorded, only up to I believe 500 every 50ms. Of course, the first ban was thanks to a hiccup on aryan’s part. But there was more than just one mass banning.</p>
<p>Where’s the lie?</p>
<p>Worked for ? Heh you are now on to the best kept secret in all of CM-dom. No one will ever truly know if I work(ed) for . As far as I remember, I have never ever personally said that I work or worked for them. Just because I never refuted the accusation doesn’t make it true.</p>
<p>As for the credit, honestly? When or if you ever talk to benland again, ask him where he got the idea from… ask where the inspiration for using bezier splines came from. I don’t think there would even be a pause before he told you it was me.</p>
<p>But, I have given far too much time to a topic of far too little worth. Best of luck to you.</p>

<p>Taios – thats was my gf’s dog then she had to give it away cause she found out he was heavily alergic to dogs and she had a asmha attack that put her in the hospital er for about 8 hours in the middle of the night so dont dare go there. onto other things so what my myspace is open go ahead go there. I dont use a computer as a means to hide my insecurities. taois why dont you go outside your house for once and get fucked like all the real woman out there or are your boobs too small that no-1 would even take a second look. even pwnd has one and im his friend on myspace or impsoft was dont rember, hes quite odd looking.</p>

        <p>Ahh I love semaphore. His verbal jousting skills make everyone else’s obsolete. His coding skills the same.</p>
<p>And he didn’t lie, he warned all of you and no one listened. You all called him a liar then got mass banned and semaphore and I had a good laugh because <span class="bbcode-b">GUESS WHAT</span>, HE WARNED YOU!</p>
<p>Aww Taios, &lt;3. I am not so sure of the “fit” part… But I’m definately underweight.</p>

        <p>never seen this “sexy client loader” also it seems he talks to everyone and tells them what to think is dectable and what not to think is dectable.  Then i get imed all day from the likes of ollie, taios, pplsqlballz about how unsigned is a devil and i am a stupid for not falling in line with the lemmings.</p>
<p>Mass ban? did you ever hear about the -uid, i guess you didn;t since you just too busy making sythescape2</p>
<p>Also how weird after the mass ban ppl could still bot even while as you said they were processing every mouse packet.  Every mouse packet from aryan was bascially instant ban once processed.  The trick was not to get flagged/pray.  It was eaiser when one knew when they were flagged.</p>

<p>Hey, was trying to inform you of it, twas all. The more better bots, the more jagex get pissed. We are all cheating after all. Sem and pplz have even offerd hints and help.</p>
<p>All that is happening here is really, you are arguing the how-to do the best bot, i agree with sem, psb and pwnd.</p>
