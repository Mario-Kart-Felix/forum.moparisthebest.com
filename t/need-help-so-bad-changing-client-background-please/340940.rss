              <p>go to where the background image is, and delete it then get the pic of the background that you want save it as a .png image and name it as the other background title was in most clients the background is named “title”, then put it in the client files wherever it’s located?</p>

              <p>A lot of people need help with this same problem, including myself. Please someone help solve this problem! The client is shit unless you can change the background…seriously…</p>
<p>It’s like giving someone your homework, and you tell them they HAVE to keep YOUR name on it…</p>
<p>It’s like giving someone a brand new car, but you tell them they HAVE to keep your name painted on the hood of the car…</p>
<p>It’s completely mental. Please tell us how to solve this problem!</p>
