              <p>[quote=“liltwixis11, post:5, topic:71844”]well, you can really make them do whatever you want<br>
if you know how to change their rights, you can make it 2 or 3 or whatever you want<br>
on client.java,after alot of codes<br>
itll says something like this</p>
<p><code> &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;=  2)</code> or whatever, that means anyone 2 or over player rights can do that command, so you could change it to whatever you want, so both you and the co-owner could do it, or you could make it so only someonewith a certain name can use it like this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&amp;&amp; playerName.equalsIgnoreCase("NAMEHERE")</code></pre>
<p>so what they can do really depends on what you want them to do.[/quote]<br>
