I might give it a try when I’m less busy, but I’ve been busy a lot recently. Also, I’m too lazy to full out make a source/client from scratch, and I’d probably give up because I can’t really commit my time to one thing that I don’t really even fully understand how to do.</p>

              <p>adu: It is not really that hard…</p>
<p>1). Normally you have to examine the client for its outgoing packets (which packets; according to their ID, when; what action that sends them and how; what ‘data-types’ they use)…</p>
<p>2). Then you need to make a new handler for them (a ‘PacketHandler’ in this case), that reads the proper values in the correct order (referred to as ‘how;…’ in the text above).</p>
<p>3). In the last and final step (before testing), you should make the server reference the handlers for the packets somehow. In most RSC private servers they use an XML file (usually called ‘PacketHandlers.xml’). In this file you should write the fully-qualified package-name (the package-name + class-name put together, and separated with a . (dot)), aswell as the ID (or IDs) of the packets you wish to reference that packet-handler with, together, and follow the used format (there should be others written, so just follow their format).</p>
<p>Note: The first step is not needed anymore (unless you really wish to learn more than C&amp;P), because the ‘protocol’ has already been almost fully documented (the documentation can be found in one of the stickies; at an external site). What I mentioned was more just how you do it in general… A. k. a. ‘reverse-engineering’ (even though reverse-engineering usually involves alot more than that).</p>
<p>I hope that explained enough for you to understand… Good luck! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>The thing that kills me is the packet handler, im kinda confused on which packets to assign where lol</p>

<p>What annoys me most though, is that most people only gives credits to the previous owner (the person(s) who released it last). This when there barely have been added anything to it. But I guess, that won’t change. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

You can make the methods and use them from RSCD v25 but then you would need to add other stuff. Basically they’re not backwards compatible. Also RSCD v25 is more like a base to add things, Firescape is more of a pk server.</p>
