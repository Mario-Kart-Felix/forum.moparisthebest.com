    <description>www.Pandora.com - Sweet Radio Station

Ever heard of it? You can search for songs by artist and name. Some of the time it won&#39;t allow you to get the exact artist, but it will play songs from similar artists which gets you into other music. I searched for Jimi Hendrix and got a few of his songs and some other songs similar to him which were pretty good too. 

Just something nice to listen to. :) Enjoy.</description>

<p>We are deeply, deeply sorry to say that due to licensing constraints, we can no longer allow access to Pandora for most listeners located outside of the U.S. We will continue to work diligently to realize the vision of a truly global Pandora, but for the time being we are required to restrict its use. We are very sad to have to do this, but there is no other alternative.</p>
<p>We believe that you are in Finland (your IP address appears to be xx.xx.xxx.xxx). If you believe we have made a mistake, we apologize and ask that you please contact us at <a href="mailto:pandora-support@pandora.com">pandora-support@pandora.com</a></p>

<p>We will be notifying listeners as licensing agreements are established in individual countries. If you would like to be notified by email when Pandora is available in your country, please enter your email address below.

<p>I used to listen to that “station” a lot before it closed down for the rest of the world. Nowadays I listen to <a href="http://www.last.fm/listen" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">last.fm</a>, which is similar to Pandora.</p>
