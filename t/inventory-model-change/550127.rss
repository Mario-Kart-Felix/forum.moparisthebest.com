    <title>Inventory model change</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/inventory-model-change/550127</link>
    <description>Alright, I have a cloning system that clones an item it changes the name and all its itemdefs even models. I can&#39;t seem to find the method that would update the inventory. I have tried the resetItems method but that does not work. I have tried requesting the update method nothing. All though when I change region (Teleport to new region) the models update. I have no idea were to look, I have tried implementing some methods that were used in the changeRegions.java and changeRegion.java. Is this client sided? or server sided? and what method would be the correct one to use?</description>
