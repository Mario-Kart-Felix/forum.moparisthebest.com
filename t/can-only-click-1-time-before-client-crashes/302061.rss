    <title>Can only click 1 time before client crashes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-only-click-1-time-before-client-crashes/302061</link>
    <description>Need help with this. I can click 1 time and 1 time only until my client crashes. If I click a second time then my client crashes. Not the server...

I run it on my brothers computer same client and server copied from a flash drive to his and it works just fine.

The problem is I don&#39;t want to host a server on his computer because mine is really good. More than capable enough to host about 200 people.

I think it is because I&#39;m running Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit Edition.

Here is specs:

AMD| Phenom X4 9950 Processor @ 2.6Ghz
PSU|  Antec Earthwatts 650 Watt (80% more Effecient) =]
OS| Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit Edition
GFX| ATI Radeon HD 4870 1GB GDDR5

My computer rating is a 5.9 and people who know the Vista rating system, that is as high as it goes. Kinda like a 10/10.</description>
