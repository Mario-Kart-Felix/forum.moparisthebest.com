    <title>Looking for Coding Team (718 rev)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-coding-team-718-rev/535103</link>
    <description>Hello everyone!

I am currently in the process of coding a 718 (Rune-Evo) server that I am planning on recreating and creating my own version of the source. At the moment I have not gotten very far since I&#39;ve only been coding for a couple of days, but with a partner or several partners I will be able to finish this and release the server to the public. Also with two+ different coders it will be easy to fix any issues or solve any problems.

[b]PLEASE READ IF INTERESTED[/b]
-While in the stages of coding I will be keeping the server running on Hamachi.
-We will be using Dropbox to code. This will allow several of us to code at the same time and automatically update to my files.
-My timezone is Eastern time and I will be able to code at around 5-10PM all week round.

[b]AFTER CODING [/b]
-After we finish most of what we are trying to accomplish on our server it will be released to the public.
-Advertising will be a big roll after this, so that the community can increase and the income from donations can help support the VPS, etc.
-My partners and I will all receive Owner ranks.

HOW TO REACH ME
[/b]-If you are interested please reply to this post and I will answer with a private message with further details.</description>
