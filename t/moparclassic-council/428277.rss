    <description>I believe we need a Council for this server, of around 5 people.

Having the regular setup (1-2 administrator call the shots for the servers direction) may not be the best idea. In my opinion 5 experienced mature RSC players should be in charge of the direction of the server, and any major changes must be approved by them all, or the majority. Council members would have absolutely no powers in game, or anywhere for that matter, they only get to steer the servers direction and approve/disapprove of ideas.

Obviously it can’t be too powerful, otherwise it would be too easy to just not play most of the time.

<p>-1. supposed to be rsc replica that wasnt in rsc. if u do little things like that why not keep deposit/cert all to bank. magic pools for ease of transportation. u want to add in new ways to make things easy but take out old things that make things easier.</p>

<p>Sounds more than reasonable, I agree with you on saying 2x is going to be to much, So im happy with somthing like 1.1x for a set period of hours.</p>
<p>But we have to take into consideration you’ll only get 1 day at a time of 1-3 hours at 1.1x if your offline for 12 hours? Otherwise people may create a seperate account, Login it once then keep it offline for days and days and gain themselves hours of an increased XP Rate?</p>
<p>Maybe decrease the offline time to 10+ because i maybe working for like 9 hours and ill be home and online just before hitting a 10 hour offline period[/quote]I was thinking 12 because most people probably won’t go on before work, so that should easily be 12.</p>

You also have to look at it and consider resource usage, as having an increased XP modifier reduces the number of raw materials required.  That being said, it should only be for gathering or combat skills.</p>

<p>You guys are forgetting magic was worth a damn… it primarily was for the ‘rich’ people to burn cash but then again… a newb could attempt at it too. I don’t see a problem with runes being limited. The wizard world is suppose to be limited. Not to mention they add up in game quite fast… just people are smart and horde them.</p>

              <p>I like the idea also. Also another incoming issue will be runes. In every low xp servers there’s always a problem with the rune supply being so low<br>
in real rsc we we had dozens of shops, spawns and added with dozens of worlds where people could harvest it. Now it’s f2p so that leaves like 2 shops,<br>
maybe one-two spawns for each rune and one world. I think this would be an issue that should be handle once the server is out, but something I think<br>

<p>I’m not sure if I like this idea of double experience. Some players will be playing with the low rate of experience, ie: Hardcore players. Double Experience can shoot someone up with EXP quite fast and the people who are “Hardcore” players will think its unfair since they won’t get the double experience.</p>

              <p>Just seen a topic regarding an existing RSC Private Server, With regard to people saying its dying, Encouraging people to help advertise it etc, Anyways thats besides the point, People were having a discussion relating to people seem to think people play that paticular server because Pking is the sole reason and bigger majority of why people play. But people disagree saying they consider 50% of the community stake or skill, And the other half infact PK.</p>
<p>People find it hard to generate an income Pking there, And are therefore obliged to skill.</p>
<p>What im trying to point out is back in RSC, I found Pking to be a very wealthy way of claiming a steady income, As kills were worth the time. Full Rune sold for large ammount of cash, I never once found myself skilling, I generated what i needed to get going, Managed to get my first R2H kill back when they were 750K, Sold it Bought a Baxe for 500k and spent the rest on my supplys, And from that day on i considered myself to be a wealthy Pker.</p>
<p>I like the idea of keeping it F2P, I dispise staking! And although the people who stake are not pkers, There the next best thing and it steals such a huge community of the potential pkers that could be in the wild, As its there only alternative that comes as close to staking really.</p>
<p>As on most Private Servers now, The economy is so fast and messed up, It’s just ruined, Which ruins the gameplay.</p>
<p>Thing that shall keep Mopar fun, Is all aspects of making money will be equal so long as there rates are kept low, Collecting buying/selling runes, Smithing/Mining, Fishing/cooking And of course Pking.</p>
<p>We are all unhappy with having to trying squeeze in time to gain levels at low exp rates, But so is everybody else, We all in the same boat, Im working a full time job and im having to come on after work and try put in the time to level, But it brings back the competitive side of the game, And people trying to hit ranks. Gives it that edge, Im sick of playing servers maxing out on several accounts, Endless supplys of everything and just no reason to put in any effort for a game, Its like playing any game and putting in the cheats, It becomes very boring after a short period of time, Same thing with RSC when everythings handed to you on a plater.</p>

<p>Well, since it’s a RSC Clone. We’re going to have to update to the new features they added? Like the, X option to stake and such. They added these new updates in some of the last openings.[/quote]</p>
