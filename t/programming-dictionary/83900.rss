    <description>Hello there!

I&#39;m planning to make a Dictionary with words related to programming, gaming, computers, hardware, software... 
I hope this will be usefull to many of you, in either a helping way, or in a way to make you understand most of the things going on here.
I&#39;ll start with a pretty small list, but I&#39;ll update this frequently.
If you got suggestions/questions (about this subject!) plz lemme know in this thread.

---------------------------------

Here we go :

Programming Vocabulary :


[b][u]C[/u][/b]:
C is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories for use with the Unix operating system.It has since spread to many other platforms. Although predominantly used for system software, C is also widely used for applications. C has also greatly influenced many other popular languages, especially C++, which was originally designed as an enhancement to C.

[b][u]C++[/u][/b]:
The C++ programming language was derived from C and is Bjarne Stroustrup&#39;s answer to adding object-oriented functionality with C-like syntax. C++ adds greater typing strength, scoping and other tools useful in object-oriented programming and permits generic programming via templates. Nearly a superset of C, C++ now supports most of C, with a few relevant exceptions (mostly of stronger typing restriction).

[b][u]C#[/u][/b]:
Pronounced: C Sharp.
C# is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of their .NET initiative, and later approved as a standard by ECMA and ISO. C# has a procedural, object-oriented syntax based on C++ that includes aspects of several other programming languages (most notably Delphi and Java) with a particular emphasis on simplification (fewer symbolic requirements than C++, fewer declarative requirements than Java).

[b][u]D[/u][/b]:
Unlike C++, which maintains nearly complete backwards compatibility with C, D makes a clean break with C while maintaining the same general syntax. It abandons a number of features of C which the designer of D considered undesirable, including the C preprocessor and trigraphs, and adds some, but not all, of the extensions of C++. Among other things, it does not provide multiple inheritance.

[b][u]Java[/u][/b]:
The most used programminging language on this forum.
Java is an object-oriented applications programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode, although compilation to native machine code is also possible. At runtime, bytecode is usually either interpreted or compiled to native code for execution, although direct hardware execution of bytecode by a Java processor is also possible.
The language itself derives much of its syntax from C and C++ but has a simpler object model and fewer low-level facilities. JavaScript, a scripting language, shares a similar name and has similar syntax, but is not directly related to Java.

[b][u]Javascript[/u][/b]:
JavaScript is the name of Netscape Communications Corporation&#39;s and now the Mozilla Foundation&#39;s implementation of the ECMAScript standard, a scripting language based on the concept of prototype-based programming. The language is best known for its use in websites (as client-side JavaScript), but is also used to enable scripting access to objects embedded in other applications.
For example, type &quot;javascript:alert(&#39;I&#39;m reading Jensie&#39;s Programming Dictionary&#39;)&quot; into your browser.

[b][u]PHP[/u][/b]:
PHP (PHP:Hypertext Preprocessor) is a reflective programming language originally designed for producing dynamic web pages. PHP is used mainly in server-side scripting, but can be used from a command line interface or in standalone graphical applications. Textual User Interfaces can also be created using ncurses.

[b][u]Void[/u][/b]:
The void type, in several programming languages derived from C, is the type for the result of a function that produces no direct result. Usually such functions are called for their side effects, much like subroutines in Visual Basic and procedures in Pascal. A function with void result type ends either by reaching the end of the function or by executing a return statement with no returned value. In C, the void type also appears in the argument lists of function prototypes to indicate that the function takes no arguments. In all of these situations, the void type serves as a unit type. The language does not allow the use of the void type in variable declarations.

[b][u]Boolean[/u][/b]:
In the Java programming language, boolean variables are represented by the type boolean, which typically occupies one byte (the actual representation is left to the JVM). No explicit or implicit casts to or from boolean are permitted. The code[code]int i = 5;
if (i) System.out.println(&quot;i is five&quot;);[/code]causes compilation errors. Code to output a boolean could be represented as[code]boolean myBool = (i == 5);
System.out.println(&quot;i == 5 is &quot; + myBool);[/code]which outputs:[code]i == 5 is true[/code]
---------------------------------

OS Vocabulary


[b][u]Unix[/u][/b]:
Unix (officially trademarked as UNIX®) is a computer operating system originally developed in the 1960s and 1970s by a group of AT&amp;T employees at Bell Labs including Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and Douglas McIlroy. Today&#39;s Unix systems are split into various branches, developed over time by AT&amp;T as well as various commercial vendors and non-profit organizations.
The present owner of the trademark UNIX® is The Open Group, an industry standards consortium. Only systems fully compliant with and certified to the Single UNIX Specification qualify as &quot;UNIX®&quot; (others are called &quot;Unix system-like&quot; or &quot;Unix-like&quot;).
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Unix&#39;s influence in academic circles led to large-scale adoption of Unix (particularly of the BSD variant, originating from the University of California, Berkeley) by commercial startups, the most notable of which is Sun Microsystems. Today, in addition to certified Unix systems, Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, Mac OS X and BSD derivatives are commonly encountered.
Sometimes, Traditional Unix may be used to describe a Unix or an operating system that has the characteristics of either Version 7 Unix or UNIX System V.

[b][u]Macintosh[/u][/b]:
The Macintosh, or Mac, is a line of personal computers designed, developed, manufactured, and marketed by Apple. Named after the McIntosh variety of apple, the original Macintosh was released on January 24, 1984. It was one of the first commercially successful personal computers to use a graphical user interface (GUI) and mouse instead of the then-standard command line interface. The current range of Macintoshes varies from Apple&#39;s entry level Mac mini desktop, to a mid-range server, the Xserve. Macintosh systems are mainly targeted at the home, education, and creative professional markets. Production of the Macintosh is based upon a vertical integration model in that Apple facilitates all aspects of its hardware and creates its own operating system that is pre-installed on all Macintoshes. This is in contrast to PCs pre-installed with Microsoft Windows, where one vendor provides the operating system and multiple vendors create the hardware. (In both cases, the hardware can run other operating systems; modern Macintoshes, like PC&#39;s, are capable of running operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD and Windows.)
Original Macintosh computers used the Motorola 68k family of microprocessors, but later models switched to Motorola and IBM&#39;s PowerPC range of CPUs in 1994. Apple began a transition from the PowerPC line to Intel&#39;s x86 architecture in 2006, which for the first time allowed Macs to run native operating system binaries for the x86 architecture. Current Macintoshes use the Intel Core, Intel Core 2 and Intel Xeon 5100 series microprocessors. All current models of Macintosh come pre-installed with a native version of the latest Mac OS X, which is currently at version 10.4.9 and is commonly referred to by its code name of &quot;Tiger&quot;. Apple will be releasing Mac OS X v10.5, codenamed &quot;Leopard&quot;, in October of 2007.

[b][u]Windows[/u][/b]:
Microsoft Windows is the name of several families of proprietary software operating systems by Microsoft. Microsoft first introduced an operating environment named Windows in November 1985 as an add-on to MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUI). Microsoft Windows eventually came to dominate the world&#39;s personal computer market, overtaking OS/2 and Mac OS which had been introduced earlier. At the 2004 IDC Directions conference, IDC Vice President Avneesh Saxena stated that Windows had approximately 90% of the client operating system market.

[b][u]Linux[/u][/b]:
Linux (IPA pronunciation: /?l?n?ks/) is a Unix-like computer operating system family. Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free software and of open source development; its underlying source code is available for anyone to use, modify, and redistribute freely.
The first Linux systems were completed in 1992 by combining system utilities and libraries from the GNU project with the Linux kernel, which led to the coining of the term GNU/Linux. From the late 1990s onward Linux gained the support of corporations such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, and Novell.
Predominantly known for its use in servers, Linux is used as an operating system for a wider variety of computer hardware than any other operating system, including desktop computers, supercomputers, mainframes, and embedded devices such as cellphones. Linux is packaged for different uses in Linux distributions, which contain the kernel along with a variety of other software packages tailored to requirements.
