    <description>I&#39;m trying to amke a ranking system and i need some help.
I want my system to be like if i have 301 score and the person i passed has 300 score itll show me above them (like rs high scores skill total) all i want to do is enter the score and it will update me where i should be and not have me have to change the names ect) 

Example: day 1
SCORE| Rank| Name
5       |  1    |  me
1       |  2    | him

Day 2 (added with day 1)
SCORE| RANK| NAME
9       | 1     |  him
6       | 2     | me

I jsut want to beable to enter the new score and have it update and move the names around and ranks, so i dont have to edit 100000000 times...</description>
