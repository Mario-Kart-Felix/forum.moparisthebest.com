    <description>Okay im looking for someone that can make me a banner preferably the size of a 317 client if you know the size if not pm and i can get it for you...

This isnt a request but if someone has some free time and is bored i would like a banner that says GENERATION on it but with the letters kinda like doubled and i want the back of the background to be black and the letters be a lime green and i want it to say on the bottom Generation... The next generation has arrived... Think you can handle it... and it to have a picture of grraddor on it and maybe like a 525 character doing dclaw special</description>
