    <title>GlobalDrops.. Not Configured</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/globaldrops-not-configured/315628</link>
    <description>Ok, well I have a .CFG file i&#39;ve been looking at and it&#39;s exposed to have random items laying on the ground (Like RuneScape in upstairs in Lumbridge with the bronze dagger etc.) All I want to know is how to make it actually spawn the item because right now there are over 30 different ones in there and none are spawing. Thanks for the help ahead of time guys.</description>
