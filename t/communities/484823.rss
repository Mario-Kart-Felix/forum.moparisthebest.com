    <description>I recently joined a few servers since I haven&#39;t been playing any much and wanted to see how they were progressing thus far.  What I found actually made me quite mad.  You see, I find that most of the communities out there are absolute shit today.

What I mean is that, I&#39;ll log onto a server and get a nice welcoming from some members, both new and old, and I&#39;ll begin my normal routine of training.  However, a few days into playing, I notice that everyone besides the maybe 3 people who welcomed me are quite immature, including the staff.  I actually got banned on one due to disagreeing with the mod&#39;s views on war.

What I&#39;m getting at is, does the immaturity of a community drive you away, or are you willing to deal with it long enough to play?</description>

The sad thing is that someone can come close to being professional, only expectation-wise; a true professional is paid to complete a certain task, while also having a set of guidelines stating what they can and cannot do. If people know they can get away for something only to have some type of beneficial gain for themselves, why not do it?</p>

Very true.  I remember applying for staff on one server and I got rejected over a 14 year old who still can’t tell the difference between there and their.  He was quite immature compared to the way I act.</p>
<p>I’m also not saying I’m <span class="hashtag">#1</span> staff for every server but I’m a hell of allot better than anyone else that applied on that specific server, but because the other could get on 2 hours more he got accepted.</p>

              <p>I believe if the server/client developers are mature, they will pick mature enough staff that will not abuse their powers and do ridiculous stuff because they’re insecure with themselves. Although, you can’t be too picky with the players because the age ranges could be vast from around 8 to 30, maybe even older. Like me, I’m mature and serious when it comes to programming/managing a server, but if you met me in real life, you’d probably want to wish you never met me or want to cut your ears off. I am a big ass troll/smart ass in real life.</p>

It’s a 2013 community in a 2006 remake. If you have censorship, the kids freak out and scream for its removal, or they just find ways to move around it.</p>

              <p>I recently joined a few servers since I haven’t been playing any much and wanted to see how they were progressing thus far.  What I found actually made me quite mad.  You see, I find that most of the communities out there are absolute shit today.</p>
<p>What I mean is that, I’ll log onto a server and get a nice welcoming from some members, both new and old, and I’ll begin my normal routine of training.  However, a few days into playing, I notice that everyone besides the maybe 3 people who welcomed me are quite immature, including the staff.  I actually got banned on one due to disagreeing with the mod’s views on war.</p>
<p>What I’m getting at is, does the immaturity of a community drive you away, or are you willing to deal with it long enough to play?</p>
