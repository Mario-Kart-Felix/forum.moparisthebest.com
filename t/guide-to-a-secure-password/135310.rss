    <title>Guide to a secure password</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/guide-to-a-secure-password/135310</link>
    <description>[center][b][u]Intro[/u][/b][/center]
Ok, we&#39;ve all seen those registration pages that tell you whether or not your password is secure. To be honest, they don&#39;t know crap. They just check if you have numbers, letters, and symbols. Most &#39;secure passwords&#39; is just the same password somebody normally uses, maybe with a number or symbol added to it.


[center][b][u]Using Passwords On Multiple Sites[/u][/b][/center]
Yes, I said normally use. There isn&#39;t ANY REASON AT ALL to use a different user and password for different sites, as long as the owner(s) don&#39;t go on the other site. For example: Its ok to use your moparscape password on myspace, because you probably wouldnt find moparisthebest on myspace. . . Its [b]NOT OK[/b] to use your private server password as your runescape password. Not only is it probably the most related example i could think of at the moment, but 80+% of servers actually try to hack you. Even if its the same username, if they figure out your runescape password, you&#39;re done. 


[center][b][u]Strong Password[/u][/b][/center]
A good password is one like this: 
[code]YV8wqD7ryP4[/code]

&lt;blockquote&gt;I won&#39;t be able to remember that&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There is easy ways to remember this, well, not remember, but never lose it.


This code: YV8wqD7ryP4
was taken from: [url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=YV8wqD7ryP4]This funny youtube link[/url]
E.G. [i]h[b][/b]t[b][/b]tp:/[b][/b]/youtube.co[b][/b]m/watch?v=[/i][u][b]YV8wqD7ryP4[/b][/u]

However, you must make sure the youtube video is easy to find(remember the search terms), bookmarked, and make sure it wont get deleted from youtube for it being inapropriate(If it does, you have it bookmarked, so you can change it). You can check by looking on the day it was added, and watching the video(:)). If the video seems like it is offensive, find another. If the video has been on for 6+ months, there is no need to find another video.</description>

<p>I quickly skimmed that page, and it looks like its talking about adding random bits to your password, per site, so your myspace password would be basepasswordmysp, password for this forum might be basepasswordmitb, and so on. I guess that’s “salting” in a way.</p>

              <p>I like to use patterns in the keyboard like I know someone who’s password was 1qaz2wsx which is easy to remember, and would take a password cracker a very long time to crack… so long most people wouldn’t bother. But also taking your favorite quote or saying, and taking the first or last letter and make a password that way</p>
<p>For example:<br>
“To be a man, you must first be a boy.”<br>
you could make: 2b@mUm1b@B<br>
I used 2 for to, 1 for first, and U for you, and @ for a, which would make the password a little more harder to crack, and its pretty easy to remember.</p>
<p>Whatever works for you, as long as its secure, and easy to remember, I like them.</p>
<p>Also I support the different passwords on different sites thing, but I also think if you on 200 sites, its fairly impossible to remember so many passwords. There are programs that randomly generate passwords and type them in for you on every site, the only downside to this, and the reason I dont use them is: If the program gets deleted, or you computer crashes really bad, you lose all you passwords - Luckily most sites have an option to send a new password to your email address, which would be acceptable, just make sure to have a really good password for your email that you can remember. I personally have about 10 passwords I use between sites, and that works fairly well for me.</p>

<p>Erm, wtf?</p>
<p>Think about it for a second. The chance of a website having a vulnerability that allows random people access to passwords is what? Let’s call it 0.5%, just to pull a random number out of our ass. Now, say you use that password on 200 sites. That makes 100%!</p>
<p>The more website you use a single password on, the more you are increasing your chance that the password will be discovered and the more problems you are creating for when it eventually does. It has nothing to do with the owner of the websites.</p>

Ok, we’ve all seen those registration pages that tell you whether or not your password is secure. To be honest, they don’t know crap. They just check if you have numbers, letters, and symbols. Most ‘secure passwords’ is just the same password somebody normally uses, maybe with a number or symbol added to it.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Using Passwords On Multiple Sites</span></span>[/center]<br>
Yes, I said normally use. There isn’t ANY REASON AT ALL to use a different user and password for different sites, as long as the owner(s) don’t go on the other site. For example: Its ok to use your moparscape password on myspace, because you probably wouldnt find moparisthebest on myspace. . . Its <span class="bbcode-b">NOT OK</span> to use your private server password as your runescape password. Not only is it probably the most related example i could think of at the moment, but 80+% of servers actually try to hack you. Even if its the same username, if they figure out your runescape password, you’re done.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Strong Password</span></span>[/center]<br>
A good password is one like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">YV8wqD7ryP4</code></pre>
<blockquote>I won't be able to remember that</blockquote>
There is easy ways to remember this, well, not remember, but never lose it.
<p>This code: YV8wqD7ryP4<br>
was taken from: <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=YV8wqD7ryP4" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">This funny youtube link</a><br>
E.G. <span class="bbcode-i">h<span class="bbcode-b"></span>t<span class="bbcode-b"></span>tp:/<span class="bbcode-b"></span>/youtube.co<span class="bbcode-b"></span>m/watch?v=</span><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">YV8wqD7ryP4</span></span></p>
<p>However, you must make sure the youtube video is easy to find(remember the search terms), bookmarked, and make sure it wont get deleted from youtube for it being inapropriate(If it does, you have it bookmarked, so you can change it). You can check by looking on the day it was added, and watching the video(:)). If the video seems like it is offensive, find another. If the video has been on for 6+ months, there is no need to find another video.</p>
