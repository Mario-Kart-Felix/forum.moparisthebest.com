    <title>Family&#39;s &#39;boiling hot&#39; floor</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;An Italian family fear their house could be haunted after the floors mysteriously got so hot they began to &#39;boil&#39;.

[img]http://www.ananova.com/images/web/1500524.jpg[/img]

It happened on Sicily which is home to the almost constantly erupting Mount Etna, one of the world&#39;s most active volcanos.

But Italian experts say there were no geological or scientific reasons for the freak temperatures at the family&#39;s home in Riesi.

Temperatures reached more than 100 degrees and the surfaces were so hot steam was coming from them.

Terrified mum Maria Fiandaca said: &quot;The floor was getting hotter all week but then it suddenly started boiling and we called the police and the firemen.&quot;

&quot;It is very frightening,&quot; said a neighbour. &quot;When science and the natural world have no answers you have to think it was the supernatural world getting in touch.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
