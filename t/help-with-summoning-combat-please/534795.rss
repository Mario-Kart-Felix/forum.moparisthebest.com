    <title>Help with summoning combat please!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-summoning-combat-please/534795</link>
    <description>So my problem is when a player is maxed combat lvl 126 he can&#39;t attack a lvl 138cb because the player with 138cb has 99summoning.My question is.How can i prevent summoning as a non-comabt skill?Like it&#39;ll show the player 138cb but they can still atk lvl 126cb in the wilderness.But if the player was 125cb and the player is 138cb,the only way they can fight in the wilderness is if they go to level 2 wilderness.HELP! THX! :D!</description>
