    <title>People complaining about upgrading 317 client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/people-complaining-about-upgrading-317-client/327440</link>
    <description>    I&#39;m sick and tired of people saying, &quot;just switch cache revisions if you want that&quot; I don&#39;t work on my server just to get features from runescape. I use things like adding to the client to learn and reinforce basic java operations. On a side note, refactoring helps to understand the code that you are working with. It&#39;s also another example of something people refuse to do for some reason. 
    I&#39;d just like everyone to keep in mind that this is a learning community and that we&#39;re not just here to make runescape private servers match runescape exactly as it is right now.</description>

No, he has a point. People start trying to add all the 500+ revision models which look terrible on the 317 client, they look tacky.<br>
All the 508 client look-a-likes are half assed, so they look terrible. If you’re going to do it, you have to do it right.[/quote]Yes, if you half ass it you might as well not add it but if actually try to add it correctly via cache and refactoring you’ll also learn other things about the client.</p>

<p>Is that what you’re talking about?[/quote]<br>
exactly, i am of the viewpoint that its your client, do what you want, and if someone has a problem they can piss off.</p>
<p>i like the 317 client because it is more lightweight and more easily modified in my opinion.<br>
20 mb is better than a 70 mb…</p>
