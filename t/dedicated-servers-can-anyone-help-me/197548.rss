    <title>Dedicated servers? Can anyone help me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dedicated-servers-can-anyone-help-me/197548</link>
    <description>Well, my mate wants to get a dedicated server for his server. So he can run it 24/7 etc.

But he dosn&#39;t want to spend much; I don&#39;t know much about dedi servers, so can anyone give me a link to a site which they are cheapish, he only needs a basic one really, his server normally has like 20 people max on it?

Thanks</description>
