    <title>[PI]Clipping - SOLVED</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-clipping-solved/437212</link>
    <description>[s]I&#39;m currently trying to add all types of clipping on my server and I&#39;m going to need the Clip and World folders that are required. This guy released a tutorial here: [url=http://pastebin.com/A9CbYZ2r]http://pastebin.com/A9CbYZ2r[/url]
Unfortunately, he removed it because of someone remaking a tutorial and not giving credits to the original maker. I was wondering if anyone had these folders and could perhaps reupload them for me.

I know I could download a few sources to scavenge them, but that is wasting precious bandwidth. Thanks. [/s]

Found the files.. sorry.</description>
