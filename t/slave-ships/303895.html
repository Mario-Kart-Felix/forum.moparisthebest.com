        <p>You’re given five different sources:</p>
<p>[size=6pt]</p>
<p>[quote=“Source A”]‘There was nothing to be heard but the rattling of chains, smacking of whips, and the groans and cries of our fellow-men. Some would not stir from the ground, when they were lashed and beat in the most horrible manner…And when we found ourselves at last taken away, death was more preferable than life, and a plan was concerted amongst us that we might burn and blow up the ship and to perish altogether in the flames; but we were betrayed by one of our own countrymen.’</p>
<p>-A slave described being taken to a ship off Cape Coast Castle[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote=“Source B”]‘You would really wonder to see how these slaves live on board… yet by careful management of our masters of ships they are so regulated that it seems incredible. And in this particular our nation exceeds all other Europeans; for as the French, Dutch and English slave-ships are always foul and stinking; on the contrary ours are for the most part clean and neat.’</p>
<p>-A Portuguese called William Bosman, 1701[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote=“Source C”]‘Two of the officers have the charge of stowing them. At sundown the Second Mate and Boatswain descend, cat [a whip] in hand, and stow the Negroes for the night. Those on the starboard side face forward and in one another’s lap, vulgarly called spoon fashion. On the port side they are stowed with face aft; this position is considered preferable for the free pulsation of the heart. The tallest are selected for the greatest breadth of the vessel, while the short size and youngsters are stowed in the fore part of the ship.’</p>
<p>-A Slaver’s Log Book by Theoplihus Connea, 1854 (slave trade was then illegal)[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote=“Source E”]’…As for provision, they were much better off than in generality of slave-ships… The slaves were supplied for breakfast with a fair ration of ground Indian corn boiled, with a spoonful of molasses to each; they generally had boiled rice for dinner; and supper was the same as breakfast. Sometimes for dinner they received each about half a pound of ship biscuit, with a little morsel of beef or pork; too much of this latter would, no doubt, have created thirst. …The captain found that allowing them what he called sufficient room and good provisions, with kind treatment, his speculations turned out much better in regard to the amount of dollars received; and that was all he cared for.’</p>
<p>-Zamba a local ‘king’, son to a king who had acquired considerable wealth as a slave dealer, travelled to the U.S in the early 1800s[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote=“Source F”]‘I always took great pains to promote the health and comfort of all on board, by proper diet, regularity, excercise and cleanliness…’</p>
<p>-Captain Crow, last of the English slavers[/quote]</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">‘The conditions on the slave ships were inhumane and the slaves were treated harshly.’ Use the sources A-F to show how far the evidence supports this statement.</span>[/size]</p>
<p>We did an essay on this and it was given back already with me receiving a 7- (I think it’s D for americans) and I want to know what could’ve been said better. What is your opinion on this? Bear in mind, only these 5 sources can be used (I skipped source D because it was just a picture of how the slaves were positioned in the slave-ships, as said in source C) but of course you can, and is very good if you support every statement you make with a fact.</p>
