    <title>RichScape source is back! (no-longer extinct!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/richscape-source-is-back-no-longer-extinct/478674</link>
    <description>This source had pretty much gone extinct! However I found an old copy on my computer so I thought i&#39;ll post it...
all the old links where mainly megaupload, which got taken down.... Time to bring back richscape source around ;)
Credits to rich! I only deserve 0.1% for re-uploading it!
