    <description>right guys this has been going on for a number of days so...

every time i try to log in on into any server it goes to a &quot;loading please-wait&quot; screen it will stay there and not log into the server. it would just stay on the same screen..

i have java jdk 6u4&gt;&gt;maybe i cant use it with this  version?

dont have moparscape 3.2 w/aryan downloaded

dont have dark bow client

and i dont have any of the previous silab clients

but i dont know what to do any advice?</description>
