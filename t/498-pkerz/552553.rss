Before I start, I am looking to build a small team of developers for a little server project, whether it gets
anywhere is another thing -;

I am looking for 2 programmers each for the server and client, I may possibly be looking for another person
to assist build the website as I&#39;m usually quite busy with my customers projects.


[B]About Pkerz;[/B]

Pkerz.com was a domain I obtained back in 2010 when I was more into RSPS than I was website development.
However after 2 years of owning the domain, I let it drop and began to continue with website development.
As a lot of users on Rune-Server I am not a Java programmer and I am purely a website developer, however
Java is something I&#39;m going to be looking into over these next few months as it&#39;s always handy to expand on
any knowledge. I am looking for a small team of developers whether it be website based, client based or simply
server based. I am planning to use a #498 revision server which was released as &quot;Arios #498&quot;. I don&#39;t intend
to download the server and run it as is. This is going to be a pking server with a nice little economy system. I 
would like to get some new interfaces and features into the current client but more about this can be discussed
with the developers of this server.


[B]Media;

[/B]Media will appear as we start making progress on the server, there is no use posting media that is already released.
