    <title>A few ideas, I want your opinions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-ideas-i-want-your-opinions/184624</link>
    <description>Alright, my new server LeEmpire is based on a class sytem, to give RuneScape a new feel...because after playing rs for 5+ years and mopar for 2...it&#39;s getting kind of old. So, here&#39;s some things I want your opinions on.

[b]Currenty Have: [/b][i]Opinions please![/i]

You spawn in the middle of the woods with 3 people, Vannaka, Mage Tutor from tutorial island, and Robin Hood. When you talk to each one they will give you a brief overview of their class (melee, mage, or range) and it&#39;s advantages and disadvantages. After you have talked to all 3 of them, you may pick your class. Once you pick it you get that classes starting items and are teleported to the starting area.

[b]Ideas: [/b][i]Opinions and suggestions, please![/i]

A spell called &quot;Adrenaline&quot;, would be very high magic level to use. It would work like vengeance, after you cast it if your hitpoints fall below 15%, your opponent is dealt a random damage from 0-30 and you get a short super boost (short being 20-30 seconds, and super boost being 30-40% boost on your classes stats), it will also restore you to half health. Once it is over however you suffer a short penalty, such as -10% for 10-20 seconds. This is kind of like real life, because in a bad situation you will start getting adrenaline, but once the situation is over you&#39;re tired and drained out.

&quot;Team&quot; and class specific quests. These will be quests were you have to interact or team up with a member of another class to finish. For example, a melee player might have to fight thru a gauntlet, then come around and open up the gate for the ranger. Then the ranger may have to shoot a rope up a hill for him and the meleer to climb. There would be different paths for different combinations on these team quests, and the quest journal would have &quot;*This is a team quest*&quot; written on the top of it. As far as class specific quests goes, every class will have access to a quest, but each class will have a different route. Take the legends quest for example, a melee might have to come down and fight some monsters while a mage or ranger can snipe them off from afar, or a mage might be able to teleport inside with the right ingrediants while a melee or ranger might have to chop their way thru the jungle. Each &quot;advantage&quot; will come with a penalty, however. Like how the mage teleported inside, he will face danger inside while the ranger and meleer will not, etc etc.

A mana system instead of runes for mages. A magic spell will require mana instead of runes, and there will be mana potions sold for long-term casting. Mana would be based on the magic level of the mage.

Boost systems for each class, kind of like prayer only with a few modifications. Each class would have it&#39;s own specific boost, but once you click it it cannot be turned off until it runs out. There would be boost potions to restore it. The boost would be a 15-20% boost in that classes specifics, and would come with some added affect. For example, a ranger might reviece the added affect of only using 1 arrow per 2 shots he fires, or a mage might use half the mana, a meleer might be able to attack alot faster, etc. Max boost would be based off of the persons combat level.

Even leveling and combat process. Since range/mages only have one stat to train, while melee has 3, the leveling would have to be easier for melee. I.E. a meleer could get 75 attack, 75 strength, and 75 defense in the same ammount of time a ranger could get 75 range or a mage could get 75 mage. Also, the combat equation would be re-written so that the meleer with all 75&#39;s would be the same combat as the ranger or mage mage with a 75 stat, instead of RuneScape&#39;s combat calculator making the ranger/mage alot less combat. Damage equations would also be completely re-written.

[b]Here&#39;s where I need your help![/b]
I would like to be able to make people have multiple classes, but I don&#39;t know what to do! Making it so once you have 99 of your class you could move to another class was my first idea, but that would be way too long. Then I thought about a quest, but I can&#39;t get the specifics down. Please post comments+suggestions on what I posted above this, and your ideas on how to integrate clases! Thank you very much for your time!</description>

<p>Mine doesn’t use thread per client which means it doesn’t have nearly the strain on system resources AND won’t slow down because of the need to service each thread.</p>
<p>Like I said I’m not saying it isn’t better than the wL based servers, but I am saying it isn’t as good as mine.</p>

              <p>LeScape, long time no see.</p>
<p>What I suggest is to go with that great classes idea. Stick it with the same class on that character all the way and you cant switch; but you can make new characters(?) Then you create a special login system which would make it so you login with a main account (email address), and then have seperate characters on that main account which you can pick from to play on. It’d make identifying multiple characters per person easier and would make it more fun.</p>
<p>Also, use RS2DV - or it wont be worth making.</p>

              <p>Following up on what LeScape was saying, I think that the “class point” system would work. But not as he explained it. Firstly, start out with class " ranks " as in ranger being…“N33b ranger, Begining range, mid-experienced ranger, archer, kings archer” etc. Do this for all classes and it will determine the damage, the bow types, the arrows, etc. If you want my opinion, this is very origional, but it also seems strangely like another source. But you gave it more detail, which I am glad someone did. If you choose to be a mage however, dont start it like splitbark, start it with like priest robes or blue wizzy. Something origional, not like saradomin robes or full mystic. Will it have a ::runes command or no-runes? Will the players be wanting to make skillers? You also have to think of this. Skillers play a role in it, so make a woodsman or something for skillers. Also, think about where your gonna find all this. As far as I know, sources this well thought into dont really have a source that fits to all this. When you get it done, tell me. I might join it. One more thing, will the server be based on dodain, pking, leveling, or all of these? Like origional rs? I think an origional rs server would own. Keep it up.</p>
